Why These Progressives Stopped Helping Biden,2023-12-06,TheAtlantic,['Russell Berman'],"Updated at 10:54 a.m. ET on December 6, 2023Throughout the summer, the Progressive Change Institute, a prominent grassroots organization aligned with Democrats, teamed up with the White House to promote President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda. The group helped organize events across the country, including in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, to publicize one of the president’s most popular proposals: a crackdown on unnecessary or hidden consumer charges popularly known as “junk fees.”The institute was encouraged by how much positive local-media coverage the events generated, taking it as a sign that a concerted campaign could lift the president’s lackluster approval ratings ahead of his reelection bid. Its leaders were eying a second round of activity this fall to amplify Biden’s record on lowering prescription-drug and child-care costs.Since October 7, however, those plans are on hold. Many progressives are protesting the administration’s support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, which began after Hamas’s massacre of more than 1,200 Israelis and has left more than 16,000 dead, according to Gaza’s Hamas-controlled health ministry. On perhaps no other issue is the gap between Democratic leaders and young progressives wider than on the Israel-Palestine conflict. “It’s just a reality that the Middle East crisis is a superseding priority for many activists and takes oxygen out of the room on other issues the White House needs to break through on,” Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Institute, told me. “We’ve let that be known.”"
An Awkward Evolutionary Theory for One of Pregnancy’s Biggest Complications,2023-10-16,TheAtlantic,['Katherine J. Wu'],"In the early 1990s, while studying preeclampsia in Guadeloupe, Pierre-Yves Robillard hit upon a realization that seemed to shake the foundations of his field. Preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication that causessome 500,000 fetal deaths and 70,000 maternal deathsaround the world each year, had for decades been regarded as a condition most common among new mothers, whose bodies were mounting an inappropriate attack on a first baby. But Robillard, now a neonatologist and epidemiologist at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de La Réunion, on Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean,kept seeing the condition crop upduring second, third, or fourth pregnancies—a pattern that a few other studies had documented, but had yet to fully explain. Then, Robillard noticed something else. “These women had changed the father,” he told me. The catalyst in these cases of preeclampsia, he eventually surmised, wasn’t the newness ofpregnancy. It was the newness of paternal genetic material that, maybe, the mother hadn’t had enough exposure to before.Robillard’s idea was unconventional not only because it challenged the dogma of the time, but because it implied certain evolutionary consequences. Preeclampsia appears to be exclusive (oralmost exclusive) to humans, and may have arisen as a by-product of the particularly aggressive ways in which our fetuses pillage their mother’s body for resources. So, Robillard and his colleagues posited, maybe the dangers it poses then pressured humans into developing a bizarre trait: being rather inefficient at conceiving offspring. Maybe, if humans aren’t terribly fertile, they need to have a lot of sex; maybe having a lot of sex repeatedly exposes a mother to her partner’s semen, inuring her to the molecular makeup of future offspring. If preeclampsia is a kind ofimmune overreaction, then perhaps unprotected sex is the world’s most unconventional allergy shot."
The Fourth Season of 'Transparent' Is a Beautiful Statement on Boundaries,2017-09-22,TheAtlantic,['Spencer Kornhaber'],"Transparentis the rare TV show held up as a symbol of the Obama era to return in 2017 withoutpilingonreferencesto Donald Trump. But the fourth season of the soulful Amazon dramedy about a Los Angeles family whose onetime patriarch transitions genders at age 68 could, if you wanted, be read as one long subtweet of wall builders. It’s a 10-episode riff on the concept of borders, with a riskier and more explicit political theme than most other shows would dare.That hot-button theme? Drumroll ... the Israel-Palestine conflict. Yes, really. Maura Pfefferman, having returned to academia, is invited to lecture at an Israeli conference on gender and Judaism. One of her adult children tags along—followed, after a shocking Holy Land revelation, by the rest of the Pfeffermans. Ali, the youngest and wokest of Maura’s three kids, connects with an activist named Lyfe who shows her around Ramallah. Her growing distress about the plight of Palestinians complicates what would otherwise be an intergenerational Birthright trip.The borders motif plays out in smaller ways, too. The family’s gorgeous home in the Pacific Palisades is being Airbnb’d to an odd German family who’s hostile to any Pfeffermans living in the basement unit. The lonely but overbearing Shelly moves in with Josh, collapsing the mother-son buffer zone. Sarah and Len consider letting another lover into their de facto marriage. Alia Shawkat’s groovy preschool teacher, a new addition, observes that deception often takes the place of boundaries in relationships: “You compartmentalize. ... It’s human.” Jason Mantzoukas, playing a reformed pothead, says, “Boundaries are how people tell other people what they need.” In every case, you see the value of borders maintained conscientiously—but often, peace comes from opening up.Three years after its initial wave of acclaim,Transparentis as beautiful television as ever, making great use of the hard-won familiarity between its audience and its characters. Previous seasons reveled in the self-involved Pfeffermans torturing themselves, but the show now eases off the pain and lets its characters just live, somewhat contentedly, for a bit. Deep thinking about sex as a source of both trauma and healing obviously informed the scripts, too. An early scene, for example, has Ali being interviewed by college administrators looking into harassment allegations against her former lover and boss. “Nothing wasdoneto me here, do you understand?” she says. A Pfefferman is, for once, not triggered.Well—scratch that. The investigation, as well as a riotously mean poem by its target published inThe New Yorker, does kick Ali into a bit of spiral. But her angst isn’t overdone, communicated in grace notes during the small-scale and emotionally generous first few episodes. Amid the grating yet comforting din of a family dinner in the premiere, Ali, Sarah, and Josh escape to the rooftop to get high but instead just banter in the cruel-but-loving way that only brothers and sisters can. ABuzzFeedquiz they take sends the trio to a sex-addiction group therapy session—and like so much ofTransparent, the expedition is outwardly comedic but inwardly serious, spiritual."
The Day Israeli-Palestinian Peace Seemed Within Reach,2018-09-13,TheAtlantic,['Martin Indyk'],"In the annals of the Arab-Israeli conflict, it was a historic turning point. At least that’s the way it seemed at the time. On this day, 25 years ago, the Oslo Accords—a framework for an interim agreement between Israelis and Palestinians—were signed on the South Lawn of the White House. President Bill Clinton, the host of the ceremony, was unable to sleep the night before. He told his peace team, of which I was a member, that he had read from his Bible instead, from the book of Joshua with its detailing of the battle of Jericho. The next morning, Clinton donned a blue silk tie with a pattern of gold trumpets. For him, the trumpets symbolized the clarion call that precipitated the walls of Jericho crumbling, just like he hoped the walls of Israeli-Palestinian conflict would come tumbling down as a result of the agreement between the modern-day equivalents of the Hebrews and Canaanites.The hundreds of dignitaries on the South Lawn on that sun-drenched fall morning were there to witness the historic handshake between PLO leader Yasir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. As Clinton’s Middle East adviser on the National Security Council, I had organized the signing ceremony. Still, few of us knew what was in the Accords. They had been negotiated behind the backs of Clinton and his peace team. Mahmoud Abbas, then Arafat’s deputy, claimed that even the Palestinian leader hadn’t read them. But like Clinton, those who bore witness cared less about the details than the symbolism. The handshake was meant to signify the moment when Israeli and Palestinian leaders decided to begin the process of ending their bloody conflict and resolving their differences at the negotiating table."
The Latest Victims of the Free-Speech Crisis,2023-11-28,TheAtlantic,['Greg Lukianoff'],"Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the issue of free speech on college campuses has received a new wave of scrutiny. Palestinian student groups have faced threats ofcensorshipfor their statements, donors have warned aboutpulling funding, and employers haveblacklistedstudents who blamed Israel for Hamas’s attack.But as far as free speech is concerned, 2023 has been a relatively normal year for colleges and universities. Just don’t confuse “normal” with “good.”So far this year, my organization, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), has received 1,312 submissions about possible free-speech violations. Compare that with 1,394 in 2022, 1,445 in 2021, and 1,526 in 2020. For 2023’s numbers to top those, the next five weeks would have to be unprecedented.That’s not to say nothing has changed. There has been a troubling uptick inthreats,vandalism, andassaultdirected at Jewish students in recent weeks. And efforts to shut down pro-Palestinian speech have intensified—including Floridaorderingits state schools to ban Students for Justice in Palestine groups and Brandeis Universityactually doing it.

Is Biden Toast?,2023-11-13,TheAtlantic,['Russell Berman'],"It’s a year before the presidential election, and Democrats are panicking. Their incumbent is unpopular, and voters are refusing to give him credit for overseeing an economic rebound. Polls show him losing to a Republican challenger.What’s true now was also true 12 years ago. Today, Democrats are alarmed by recentsurveysfinding that President Joe Biden trails Donald Trump in five key swing states. But they were just as scared in the fall of 2011, when President Barack Obama’s approval ratinglanguished in the low 40sand a pair of national polls showed him losing to Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who would become the GOP nominee. Barely one-third of independent voterssaidObama deserved a second term. ANew York Times Magazinecover storyaskedthe question on many Democrats’ minds: “Is Obama Toast?”A year later, Obama beat Romney handily, by a margin of 126 in the Electoral College and 5 million in the popular vote. Those results are comforting to Democrats who want to believe that Biden is no worse off than Obama was at this point in his presidency. “This is exactly where we were with Obama,” Jim Messina, the former president’s 2012 campaign manager, told me by phone this week. For good measure, he looked up data from earlier elections and found that George W. Bush and Bill Clinton each trailed in the polls a year out from their reelection victories. Perhaps, Messina hoped, that would “calm my bed-wetting fucking Democratic friends down.”"

Giving Birth in Gaza,2023-12-02,TheAtlantic,['Claire Porter Robbins'],"Every morning since October 7, Nour Shath has woken up, scanned her body, and felt relief that her twin babies were still inside her. Each additional day, her doctor has told her, makes their birth less likely to require an obstetric or neonatal intervention that might not be available in Gaza.But even after those morning checks reassure her that she’s one day closer to a normal, safe delivery, Shath told me, she feels a deep, wrenching fear—one she worries she’ll transmit to her babies: “Are they feeling scared inside me?” she asks herself. She wonders whether they can sense when she cries, and whether the stress will induce premature labor.“I am a working counselor, I know how to deal with negative thoughts,” she told me by text during one of Gaza’s brief interludes of data coverage. “But I try everything without anything helping. I am under stress most of the time.”“I told my husband I don’t feel safe giving birth in Gaza,” she told me."

Trump Keeps Claiming That the Jerusalem Embassy Will Bring Peace,2018-05-14,TheAtlantic,['Michael Koplow'],"Moving the United States embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, as President Trump did on Monday, constitutes a momentous show of support and friendship to Israelis. It is a recognition of the importance that Jews have attached to Jerusalem for millennia. It grants Israel the same legitimacy to establish its own capital that is taken as a given by every other country in the world. It is a worthy policy initiative in its own right, and should have been done decades ago.Moving the embassy is not, however, a policy that will break the Israeli-Palestinian impasse, make it easier for the U.S. to mediate between the two sides, or bring peace any closer. In fact, the manner in which the embassy move was announced and implemented pushes all these things much farther away—a reality that was underscored when Israeli forces killed dozens of Palestinians in Gaza, during the penultimate day of a weeks-long demonstration there, even as the embassy dedication was happening.It was jarring to behold, while all this blood was being shed, the emphasis on peace at the embassy dedication: Israeli singer Hagit Yaso performed “Od Yavo Shalom Aleinu” (“Peace Will Come To Us”). U.S. Ambassador David Friedman extolled the virtues of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. And Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner said, “We will look back on this day” and remember that “the journey to peace started with a strong America recognizing the truth.” Clearly, Trump and his administration are refusing to own up to the real consequences that his decision will have on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But dissembling about the true costs of moving the embassy will only complicate American policy in the region."
We’ve Never Seen Anything Like the Menendez Indictment,2023-10-26,TheAtlantic,['Casey Michel'],"Even before Bob Menendez waschargedearlier this month with conspiring to act as a foreign agent, dozens of his fellow Democrats were calling on him to resign. Prosecutors say Menendez used his political office to influence American policy at the behest of the Egyptian government. He remains a senator—for now—but the latest indictment, coming aftercorruption charges last month, further complicates his fate. Last week, Menendez, who has pleaded not guilty to all counts, missed an all-senators classified hearing on Israel—no small indignity for a former chair of the Foreign Relations Committee.According to theindictment, the senator from New Jersey passed along sensitive information to Egypt, acted as a ghostwriter for its officials, and accepted “hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes.” While researchingmy next book, a history of the foreign-lobbying industry in the United States, I didn’t come across anything quite like these allegations. They appear to be the first time that an elected federal official has been formally accused of acting as an agent of a foreign government."
How I Lost the Russia That Never Was,2023-11-24,TheAtlantic,['Anna Nemtsova'],"Updated at 9:31 p.m. ET on November 25, 2023.The lack of respectfor the deadsurprised even a soldier with the Wagner Group, Russia’s mercenary legion of former convicts that fought some of the bloodiest battles in the invasion of Ukraine. He looked at an ugly heap of wooden crosses and flower wreaths that had been pushed aside and cursed the authorities.“What are you doing? They died for Russia, and you are razing their graves to the ground. You are rolling over them,”he saidin a video shot at the time, pointing at the wreckage.Workers were pouring concrete over a Wagner cemetery near the southern Russian city of Samara on August 24, part of Moscow’s punishment for the private army’s one-day mutiny in June. Not many in Russia noticed the soldier’s distress. Layers of injustice and mass killings go so far and so deep into Russia’s history that most of us have lost track. In Ukraine, the Russian army often leaves its dead soldiers behind."

How Rand Paul Misconstrues the Fourteenth Amendment,2015-09-24,TheAtlantic,['Garrett Epps'],"Last year,Timechristened Rand Paul “the most interesting man in American politics.” I suppose that’s true, if youconsider Floyd the Barberthe most interesting man in Mayberry. Like Floyd, Paul always seems to be gazing at some fabulous landscape no one else can see; like Floyd, he is given to non-responsive pronouncements that don’t always make sense to ordinary mortals.That propensity was on display in last week’s Republican debate, in which Paul managed to attach himself to Donald Trump’s assault on the bedrock Fourteenth Amendment principle of birthright citizenship. In the wake of Trump’s claim that only “television scholars” uphold that principle, Paul interjected the following:This statement contains one half-truth (at best) and one statement that, though vaguely phrased, seems flatly false. The half-truth concerns the case ofWong Kim Ark v. United States,in which the Supreme Court considered the citizenship clause and concluded that the words—“all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside”—mean that an American born in the U.S. of Chinese parents was a U.S. citizen, even though, under the law at the time, the parents were not and could never become citizens themselves.Critics of birthright citizenship focus onWong Kim Arkas if it were the source of the doctrine. They are eager to find a hole—any hole—in its holding. Hence the claim that the case reserved the issue of children of “those who are here illegally.”Politifact investigated Paul’s claim aboutWong Kim Arklate last week, and rated it “Mostly True.” And it is true, in the following sense. InWong Kim Ark,the Court said that Wong, an adult-male child of Chinese immigrants legally present, was a citizen. It didn’t specifically state that an adult-male child of, say, Mexican immigrants legally present was a citizen. It did not state that an adult female child of immigrants lawfully present was a citizen. It did not state that a gay or lesbian child of immigrants was a citizen. It also didn’t discuss whether a small gray alien in a disk-shaped spacecraft would have citizen children. It said nothing about “green cards,” which didn’t exist. It did say this:"
Can Germany Resist the Trump Disease?,2023-10-25,TheAtlantic,['David Frum'],"Israeli flags. Guitar music. Bicycles. Strollers, dogs, and thick sweaters. Here at the Brandenburg Gate on a sunny October Sunday, 20,000 people gathered, united by the ideals of the modern German state. The German president spoke. The Israeli ambassador spoke. The father of two kidnapped daughters spoke. The audience listened attentively.Then, when it was all over, those traveling by subway removed their kippah, put away their Stars of David. The police cannot be everywhere at once, and so they protectively advise Berliners not to display symbols of Judaism.Some days earlier, on October 18, two peoplethrewincendiary devices at a synagogue in central Berlin. This followed a week of clashes between police and protesters in a heavily Muslim section of the city, Neukölln. Earlier this month, the German magazineDer Spiegelpublished an interviewwith Güner Balci, the integration commissioner for the district, who was born in Neukölln, the child of Turkish immigrants. The dialogue, in a question-and-answer format, included this section:"
The Reckoning,2023-10-10,TheAtlantic,['Yossi Klein Halevi'],"On April 22, 1979, four Palestinian terrorists set out from southern Lebanon on a rubber dinghy and landed on the Israeli coast, near the northern town of Nahariya. They proceeded to an apartment building, breaking through the front door of the Haran family. Inside, they seized Danny Haran and his 4-year-old daughter, Einat. Meanwhile Danny’s wife, Smadar, hid in the attic with her 2-year-old daughter, Yael.The terrorists took their two hostages to the beach, where they shot Danny and smashed Einat’s skull against a rock. Back in the attic, Smadar, attempting to quiet Yael, accidentally smothered her to death.Of all the Palestinian terror attacks of the era, none had as great an impact on the generation of Israelis that came of age around the 1973 Yom Kippur War as the destruction of the Haran family. The fate of the Harans hit so hard in part because the ultimate Israeli nightmare is helplessness. Zionism promised to empower the Jews; the Haran family’s fate belonged to Eastern Europe, not the Jewish state."
End the Misuse of Holocaust History,2017-04-14,TheAtlantic,['Deborah Lipstadt'],"With apologies to Mel Brooks, it’s springtime for Hitler and Nazi Germany.Comparisons to the Third Reich are blooming. History is being instrumentalized and mangled. More than wrong, it is dangerous.The past week alone brought three examples. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has been universally ridiculed for saying that Assad was worse than Hitler because even Hitler did not use chemical weapons on “his own people.” A sympathetic reporter tried to throw him a lifeline. Ignoring it, he dug himself in deeper with a reference to “Holocaust centers” and the assertion that Hitler did not strike “innocent” victims. To his credit, he later apologized. Repeatedly.Spicer’s inept historical analogies may have attracted the most media attention in the United States, but they hardly constituted the worst recent such transgression. Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London and a long term Labour party stalwart, engaged in a far more premeditated attempt to manipulate World War II history. For the third time in a year, he repeated his claim that Zionists and Nazis engaged in “real collaboration” in the 1930s. According Livingstone, the Nazis did the Zionists’ bidding, including forcing rabbis to stop giving sermons in Yiddish, setting up training camps for Jews who wanted to go to Israel, and selling them arms.Livingstone’s claims so lack any historical accuracy that one is loath to refute them. (Would we ask a scientist to refute claims that the earth is flat?) He has spun this historical fantasy on the back of theHa’avara agreement, made between the Nazis and German Zionists in August 1933. German Jews were prevented by Nazi regulations from taking their savings out of Germany. Under the agreement, the Palestinian Jewish community bought German agricultural equipment with some of the blocked funds. Jews who came to Palestine from Germany were able to claw back a portion of their funds upon arrival. This agreement generated controversy among Jews and some Nazis. The former were trying to organize a boycott of German goods, which this agreement contravened. The latter disliked anything that helped Jews. To call it collaboration or to say it proves Hitler was a Zionist, though, stretches those terms beyond any meaning.Livingstone’s attempt to rewrite history has a contemporary political purpose. He is trying to draw a direct line between Nazism and Zionism by equating the two, to claim that today’s supporters of Israel are heirs to the Nazis. Israel becomes more than a place to compensate Jews for their suffering. It becomes a place that flourished thanks to their suffering.But Livingstone was not alone in his revisionism. Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right French National Front, who stands a chance of winning the presidency in the forthcoming elections, contended thatFrance bore no responsibility for the Val d’Hivroundup of 13,000 Jews in the summer of 1942. The Jews were held for days in searing heat and horrific conditions—little food, water, or facilities—until they were deported. Most ended up in Auschwitz, where they were gassed."
How Did the 'Secret' Sykes-Picot Agreement Become Public?,2016-05-16,TheAtlantic,['David A. Graham'],"Monday marks the 100 years since the signing of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, the secret Anglo-French pact reached during the First World War that proposed splitting the Middle East up into zones of foreign control. The Middle East has been frequently afflicted with war since then, but the situation now—with ISIS holding territory in Iraq and across the Fertile Crescent, civil war in Syria, government paralysis in Lebanon, growing autocracy and violence in Turkey, and talk of an intifada in Israel and the occupied territories—has inspired particular debate on the century-old agreement’s legacy. Laments about Sykes-Picot drewarbitrary divisionsthat bedevil the Middle East even now have met withjust-as-impassioned insistencethat the secret agreement’s influence is overstated.But wait a second:secretagreement? How did a confidential document become a hotly contested matter of the public record not long after it was signed? The answer is a tale of intrigue that serves as a reminder of how unstable closed-door diplomacy is, and how fast quiet handshakes can cause public backlash, even in the age before Wikileaks.The agreement was negotiated, on the British side, by Mark Sykes, an aristocrat and soldier. A veteran of the Boer War and member of Parliament, he was plucked from the reserves—and saved from the front lines—by Lord Kitchener, the secretary of war, at the start of World War I and became a leading Middle East hand. He barely outlived the war: Sykes died of Spanish influenza in February 1919 while attending the Paris Peace Conference that would formalize the terms of the settlement. François Georges-Picot, who negotiated on behalf of the French, was somewhat older, a career diplomat who had been stationed in Beirut and Cairo."
The Republicans Have No Majority,2023-11-14,TheAtlantic,['Russell Berman'],"Mike Johnson now knows what Kevin McCarthy was dealing with.At the new speaker’s behest, House Republicans today relied on Democratic votes to avert a government shutdown by passing legislation that contains neither budget cuts nor conservative policy priorities. The bill was a near replica of thefunding measurethat McCarthy pushed through the House earlier this fall—a supposed surrender to Democrats that prompted hard-liners in his party totoss himfrom the speakership.Johnson is unlikely to suffer the same fate, at least not yet. But today’s vote laid bare a reality that’s become ever more apparent over the past year: Republicans may hold more seats than Democrats, but they don’t control the House.Under McCarthy and now Johnson, Republicans have been unable to pass just about any important legislation without significant help from Democrats. The three most consequential votes this year have been the spring budget deal thatpreventeda catastrophic U.S. debt default, September’s stopgap spending bill that averted a shutdown, and today’s proposal that keeps the government funded through early 2024. More Democrats than Republicans have voted for all three measures."
"Building a Fair-Trade Fashion Line Out of ‘Pride, Not Pity’",2017-06-29,TheAtlantic,['Elisha Brown'],"In a world of fast fashion,sustainable-fashionbrands tout their dedication to transparent and ethical production. While goods from these companies can be expensive, the goal is to pay producers a living wage while creating fashionable, high-quality clothing.As resistance to fast fashion was picking up, Harper Poe graduated from college and started a day job that didn’t inspire her.

Trump’s Only Iran Strategy Is to Punish Iran,2018-05-19,TheAtlantic,['Jake Sullivan'],"After Donald Trump’s announcement last week that the United States was walking away from the Iran nuclear deal, two State Department officials held a background briefing to explain the strategy. The transcriptis a painful read. From start to finish, the unnamed officials struggled to answer the most basic questions about the purpose of reimposing sanctions on Iran, what they expected to achieve, which allies they had consulted, and so on. Every time a reporter tried to pin them down on the core question—now that you’ve junked the deal, what comes next?— they mumbled and evaded.This past Friday, reporters tried again, on another conference call with a senior State Department official. They pressed him for specifics on what exactly the plan will be going forward. The most he would offer was that the United States would bring “all necessary pressure to bear on Iran to change its behavior and to pursue a new framework that can resolve our concerns.” It is hard to get less specific than that.This is not because these officials are uninformed or unintelligent. And it is not because key figures in the administration, like National-Security Adviser John Bolton, haven’t given it some thought. My guess is it is because, for some reason, they did not feel comfortable sharing the real answer,which is this: The punishmentisthe strategy. The United States will now apply the means of more economic pressure to achieve the end of Iran feeling more economic pressure.In theory, sanctions should have a specific purpose. We impose them in response to certain behavior by another country, and offer to lift them in exchange for specified changes in that behavior. In other words, sanctions create leverage, which is then converted into concessions at the negotiating table. That was the story of the Iran nuclear deal, which I helped negotiate, including by opening the secret back channel with Iran that jump-started the diplomacy.Advocates of a more aggressive Iran policy, both inside and outside the administration, view sanctions differently. They seem to feel they don’t need to give more-specific answers as to what exactly sanctions are intended to achieve, because from their perspective, whatever is achieved is better than the status quo. Maybe with sufficient pressure, the regime will collapse. That would be their ideal outcome, and it’s what John Bolton was referring to recently when he said, “Iran’s economic condition is really quite shaky, so that the effect [of reimposing sanctions] could be dramatic.” But maybe not—maybe sanctions will just leave the regime weakened and demoralized and inwardly focused.That would be good, too. But maybe not—maybe the regime will just have less disposable income to spend on regional adventurism and therefore reduce its activities in places like Syria and Yemen. That’s not bad. But maybe not—maybe sanctions will simply make it harder for Iran to become stronger, an economic version of containment. Even that will do."

How the Movement for Black Lives Turned Against Israel,2016-08-18,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"Last Thursday, the Movement for Black Lives got together for an emergency conference call. One week after the drafting committee released its political platform—a long document that covers everything from U.S. policing to education reform to mass incarceration—the activists felt they needed another “deep internal discussion,” as they called it, on one small section toward the end: their statement on Israel and Palestine.Of all the positions included in the platform, this is the one that has generated the most backlash. The conflict is largely one of language: Jewish groups have been most upset about its use of the wordsgenocideandapartheidto describe Israel’s actions against the Palestinians,describingthe terms as “offensive and odious.” Some progressive, social-justice-oriented organizations have condemned the statements in part; others have condemned the movement in full. Church groups haverepudiatedit. Jews of color havestruggledwith it. In the wake of what should have been a powerful moment, black activists have found themselves at odds with the one group that may have been most ready to support them as allies.But this is also a conflict of history. Jews and blacks in America have long danced around one another, at times feeling solidarity and at others, opposition. Both groups have developed a self-understanding rooted in a history of oppression and struggle, often in solidarity with others in need. Their clash on Israel may be a testament to how much U.S. views have changed on this issue, or how much Israel’s self-vision has changed since 1948. But it’s also a sign of how thoroughly elements of these groups have become alienated from one another—hoping for justice, but hearing different things when they try to speak its language.It’s not clear what the Movement for Black Lives will do about the backlash against this part of its platform, if anything. An informal spokesperson for the drafting committee, Zakiya Scott, declined interviews, saying, “Folks have been getting a lot of criticism for the divest/invest piece of the platform. Before we say anything as a group, it has to be agreed upon by the members of the leadership team and the endorsing organizations.”On every side, the clash over language and history in the Movement for Black Lives platform is a story of loss. Relationships have been damaged, and political momentum lost. And the hope of liberation, cherished by black and Jewish Americans alike, has been cut with resentment."

Schiff spoke first. “It’s such a beautiful evening,” he said, thanking the host, local Democratic Representative Josh Harder.It was hard to know what to make of the protest vessel, except that its seven passengers were yelling things as Schiff began his remarks. And not nice things. Although their words were tough to decipher, the flag flying over the craft made clear where they were coming from:FUCK BIDEN. Notably, of the three candidates, Schiff was the only one I heard singled out by name—or, in one case, by a Donald Trump–inspired epithet (“Shifty”) and, in another, a four-letter profanity similar to the congressman’s surname (clever!)."
The Six-Day War Was a Step Backward for Zionism,2017-06-06,TheAtlantic,['Michael Koplow'],"Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War and its resulting military occupation of the West Bank and its Palestinian residents transformed the Jewish state, providing it with both a measure of security it had not enjoyed and the responsibility of governing a people it did not want. It also transformed Zionism—from an ideology of pragmatism and activism into an ideology of utopianism and passivity.The stunning defeat of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, and the sudden expansion of the territory under Israel’s control was ironically a step backward for Zionism, and it has struggled ever since to reconcile its core philosophy with the set of circumstances that has reigned for the past half century. The 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War is an opportunity not only to examine Israel’s past and future trajectory, but also to refashion a more pragmatic Zionism for the next 50 years.Zionism has always had different strains, from the secular Zionism that predominated in the early years of the movement to the religious Zionism that surged following the Six-Day War. Theodor Herzl’s Zionist vision was the very definition of a utopian fantasy that seemed unachievable: a homeland for a persecuted nation scattered across the globe in a place from which they had been exiled millennia before. That this vision actually came to pass was truly miraculous, but its implementation was anything but a dream. The early Zionists who settled Palestine did not arrive to a Jewish state or even to Jewish self-determination; they arrived to a land controlled first by the Ottomans and then by the British, with little infrastructure or natural resources, and populated by frequently hostile neighbors.When Israel was born half a century after the first Zionist Congress had called for a Jewish home in Palestine, it emerged directly into a war with its neighbors that resulted inone percentof the new country’s population being killed in the fighting to prevent the new state from being stillborn. The first 19 years of Israel’s existence were marked by struggles to create a viable economy, fend off attacks from the Arab countries surrounding the Jewish state, establish diplomatic ties with the world, and absorb hundreds of thousands of penniless immigrants and refugees.This was certainly not the fulfillment of Herzl’s utopian vision, laid out inAltneuland, of a prosperous country and harmonious society. But it was the fulfillment of the Zionist essence: Jewish self-determination in the Jewish homeland. That the boundaries of the state in that homeland were limited and that the state was beset by true existential threats presented daily problems for Israel’s governance, but they did not present a threat to Zionism itself. Zionism had become a quest not for the perfect but for the possible, and it was this pragmatism and focus on a single core idea that made Zionism the rare 20th-century ideology that actually delivered on its promise and survived the crucible of wars, upheavals, and Cold War struggles."
The Myth of the ‘First TikTok War’,2022-03-10,TheAtlantic,['Kaitlyn Tiffany'],"Have you been watching thewar in Ukrainevia TikTok? Supposedly, everyone has been. “This is the first war that will be covered on TikTok by super-empowered individuals armed only with smartphones,” theNew York Timescolumnist Thomas Friedmanwrotein February. That same week,all kindsofpublicationsstartedreferring to the invasionas “the first TikTok war”;New York Magazinecoinedthe portmanteau “WarTok.” TikTok is anewglobal platform, and smartphone saturation isnewin Ukraine, so perhaps it’s a reasonable claim. But is it a useful one?The history of war is also a history of media, and popular memory associates specific wars with different media formats. Vietnam was the first television war. The first war in Iraq, in 1991, was the first cable-news war, or thefirst CNN war. (The network famouslypulled offa “coup” by successfully broadcasting live from Baghdad.) Twelve years later, the American invasion of Iraq was “supposed to be CNN’s war” again, but instead became the Fox News war. Itwas also called“the YouTube war,” in which, as one journalism professorput it, soldiers made “personal and at times shockingly brutal” homemade videos of gunfights, suicide bombings, and other violence, many set to rap or metal music. MTV turned some of this footage intoa 2006 documentarytitledIraq Uploaded; then, the following spring, the U.S. military blocked troops from accessing YouTube on military computers. So the YouTube war ended. The Iraq War continued."
Rashida Tlaib’s Inflammatory Language,2023-11-08,TheAtlantic,['Juliette Kayyem'],"I met Rashida Tlaib in 2009, before she was elected to Congress, when she was a young Palestinian American newly serving in the Michigan House of Representatives. I was the highest-ranking Arab American woman in the Obama administration and was receiving a key to the city of Dearborn, known as theheart of Arab America. She may not remember me from that day, but I remember her. She was a mesmerizing presence: attentive, sociable, and seemingly fearless.Nearly a decade later, Tlaibwon a U.S. House seatand became one-quarter of the outspokenly progressive “Squad.” Her ascent was an inspiration to many women of Muslim and Arab heritage—including me, a Lebanese American Christian who’s raising her children in their father’s faith, Judaism—because so few of us play any visible role in American politics. She was also noteworthy as a prominent advocate for Palestinians, who have suffered terribly for their statelessness.But Tlaib is not helping anyone’s cause by amplifying activist rhetoric that, to many ears, casually deploys the language of annihilation.Last week, Tlaib circulated a video on X, formerly Twitter, that sharply criticized President Joe Biden for supporting Israel’s military retaliation against Hamas in Gaza. She went on to justify a highly inflammatory Palestinian-resistance slogan. “From the river to the sea,”she wrote, “is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence.”"

"The First Nomination as Tragedy, the Second as Farce",2020-05-08,TheAtlantic,['David A. Graham'],"If at first you don’t succeed, you can always hope the Senate’s fecklessness will rescue you. Just ask Representative John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican and—for the second time—President Donald Trump’s pick for director of national intelligence.Trump announced plans to nominate Ratcliffe to the post last summer, then withdrew him, after it became clear that Ratcliffe had practically no qualifications for the job, and those he did have were badly misrepresented. Yet now Ratcliffe seems like he might actually end up as DNI. This week, Senator Susan Collins, the Republican from Maine, said she’d support his nomination in committee, meaning he’s likely to go to the full Senate for a vote.It’s a travesty that Ratcliffe would be nominated and a travesty that he’d be confirmed. The path to this travesty is Trump’s abuse of the power to appoint acting officials, and the Senate’s decision to surrender to it. Trump has exercised his prerogative to name acting officials far more than any previous president—and not just to fill jobs until a permanent holder can be confirmed. Instead, Trump prefers to use acting officials because he knows they’re beholden to him and not to the Senate, and they can be easily removed if his mercurial temper turns against them. “I like acting because I can move so quickly,” he said last year. “It gives me more flexibility.”"
The Israeli Military Wasn’t Ready for This,2023-10-09,TheAtlantic,['Andrew Exum'],"Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel has laid bare an uncomfortable truth: The fearsome reputation of the Israeli military, like that of Israeli intelligence services, may be overdue for a revision.Israel has an excellent air force and elite special-operations units, but its conventional line units—made up mostly of conscripts—are neither particularly well trained nor well disciplined by American standards. These units are still demonstrably superior to those of Israel’s adversaries from wars gone by, such as Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. But today Israel faces highly disciplined and motivated nonstate foes in southern Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, and its military does not seem to have a clear advantage over them at the unit level.The United States provides Israel roughly $3.8 billion a year in military assistance. (Last year, only Ukraine received more.) That money allows Israel to purchase expensive weaponry, such as F-35 aircraft, that it would otherwise struggle to afford. The two countries review and agree on the amount of aid every 10 years; when we signed our most recent memorandum of understanding with Israel, in 2016, I was the Pentagon’s senior representative, taking part in several months of negotiations in Washington, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem. I had a chance to look under the hood of the Israeli military, and I came away hugely impressed with the Israeli officers with whom I worked. But I was also frankly worried about what the next war might look like."
A Historic Cataclysm in the Middle East,2023-10-07,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"War is a perpetual concern in Israel, but it has been decades since Israelis have had to wonder whether today might be the day that their borders will be overrun and their enemies will go building to building deciding whom to slaughter. Early this morning, a few Israeli military outposts and settlements saw an apparent preview of that nightmare—an operation by Hamas that could be a daring single-day raid or the start of a regional war of a scale not seen since 1973. Hamas fired rockets at Israel thousands of times, then began a land-air-sea operation against targets in southern Israel. Commandos in gliders, trucks, and dune buggies raided Israeli military posts around Gaza. Images on social media show Israeli soldiers in states of dress and undress, apparently dead in the dirt, and Hamas fighters celebrating the destruction of armored vehicles and the looting of lighter ones. The images from Israel show carnage and cruelty comparable to Mesopotamia during the campaigns of the Islamic State.Much worse than the images of dead soldiers are those of Israeli civilians seemingly having been killed in incursions into towns and settlements nearby. Some images show old women at a bus stop, their possessions still next to them, and their blood and viscera leaking from their corpses. Others—all still unconfirmed—are even worse, with indications that gunmen went door-to-door and killed indiscriminately while residents huddled in fear. More and more videos are emerging of civilians beaten and sometimes soaked in blood, either their own or others’. They appear to have been transported to Gaza as hostages. The dead are not spared this fate. Two videos I have seen suggest that Hamas has taken the corpses of Israeli soldiers to Gaza and encouraged crowds to desecrate them. A woman’s body is stripped partly naked and spat upon."
Eight Steps to Shrink the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,2019-04-01,TheAtlantic,['Micah Goodman'],"One evening, about five years ago, I approached a small group of students. They were at Ein Prat, an institution that I head in Israel, where some 3,000 young Israelis have studied in recent years. Some are very religious, others deeply secular, but they share a deep connection. I asked the students what binds them together. One got up and said something that caused the group to burst into laughter—a laughter that expressed full agreement. “The secret,” he said with a smile, “is that we never talk about politics.”I was uncomfortable with this answer, precisely because I felt it was correct. In many closely connected communities, people do discuss politics, but they tend to share similar views. The alternative to homogeneous communities that talk about politics, it seems, is heterogenous communities that do not. Is there another possibility? Can groups be politically diverse without staying silent about their beliefs?"

How Nietzsche Explains Turkey,2018-06-21,TheAtlantic,['Selim Koru'],"In 1989, a small Islamist party called Refah, or “Welfare,” holds aconferencetitled “National Consciousness.” In the crowd are mustached men with lean faces; many of them are old, wearing skullcaps Muslims use during prayer. Soon, a tall, thin young man dressed in a well-tailored suit rises to speak. “May the peace of God be upon all believers,” he says. His polite bearing, however, belies his firm message. He invokes the ur-enemies of Turkishness—*“Agop,” the Armenians, and “Jacques” and “Hans,” a reference to the Europeans. They distribute birth control to the villages, corrupt the youth, and scoop up Turkey’s national wealth, he claims, adding that Turkey’s bureaucrats, farmers, widowers, and orphans are all forced to pay them interest, “that which will facilitate the reign of the Jew.” Meanwhile, the ruling class lies around on nude beaches, sips fancy alcohol, and gawks at exotic dancers from the far corners of the earth, he says. All the evil, theft, and corruption in the country, the man says, can be traced to a mentality of surrender to the West. But Turkey’s true heirs will eventually take their country back. “You must love,” he says, “you must be possessed with the idea that holy justice will reign in this country.”In the years to come, the young man, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, would be elected mayor of Istanbul, prime minister of Turkey, and, in 2014, president. Today, he is reconfiguring the very DNA of the state. Last year, he redrafted the constitution to create asuper presidencythat will allow him toreshape the state apparatusover the next decade. First, he’ll need to win one more election, the first round of which will be held on June 24."
Has Anyone Noticed That Trump Is Really Old?,2023-11-20,TheAtlantic,['David A. Graham'],"Donald Trump is an old man.He’s 77 years old. When Trump was born, Harry S. Truman was president and Perry Como topped the year’s pop charts. Betty White hadn’t yet started her career in film. Israel and Pakistan didn’t exist. Korea was a unified country, and Vietnam was not. The pioneering computer ENIAC was just four months old.Trump’s cultural references are dated, and only getting more so. Elton John and the Rolling Stones headline his rally playlists. When, as president, he had a chance to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, hisselections includedBabe Ruth (who died in 1948) and Elvis (who died in 1977—perhaps).The same goes for his political touchstones. His view of immigration, in which foreign countries dispatch their undesirables en masse, seems to be shaped largely by the 1980 Mariel boatlift. His trade policy is steeped in ’80s-era fears of Japan. He rails against “Communists” and “Marxists” like a Cold Warrior of yore (only with a peculiar affection for the Russians, rather than enmity)."
Stop Doomscrolling About Israel and Palestine—Read These Books Instead,2023-10-27,TheAtlantic,['Gal Beckerman'],"The Israeli author Etgar Keret’s fantastical, funny, and very short stories have long offered insight into the anxieties that simmer in his own society. Wespoke a couple of days ago, and Keret told me that in the past three weeks sincethe war beganbetween Israel and Hamas, he has been turning to more ephemeral forms of writing, even shorter than his usual work. He calls them “war notes”: short thoughts, observations, and outlines of stories jotted down quickly, as if meant to be shoved deep in a pocket or thrown away. This reflex—to process the violence and the emotion it provokes through writing—is well established when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many, many bookshelves could be filled with works that either explain the modern history of the region or offer an individual entry point into what living through such daily tension and pain has felt like. Without attempting to be comprehensive or authoritative—a fool’s errand if there ever was one—I thought I would suggest just a few of my own favorites. At the very least, I prescribe these titles as antidotes to the quick and dirty ways people are communicating about the war on social media.First, here are four new stories fromThe Atlantic’s Books section:"
A U.S. Funding Review Is Hurting Aid Groups and Palestinians,2018-08-10,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"In January, Donald Trump’s administration suspended the financial aid it provides Palestinians, pending what it said was a review. Seven months later, not only are there few indications the review is complete, but the freeze on tens of millions of dollars in mostly humanitarian aid has hobbled the aid agencies that receive the funds, and, more consequentially, crippled the lives of more than 1 million people who live in dire need.“A lot of donors have put more money on the table: the U.K., Canada, Japan, but it’s not enough,” Jamie McGoldrick, the United Nations development and humanitarian coordinator in Palestine, told me in a recent interview. McGoldrick added that many of the commitments were front-loaded—in other words, countries were taking a portion of next year’s commitment to Palestinians and disbursing them this year. “What comes after that is uncertainty,” he said.Already, he said, there has been a slow but sure collapse of water supply and sanitation in the Gaza Strip, the coastal enclave that is controlled by Hamas, a militant group. Electricity is restricted to about four hours a day. “People are trying to buy power,”McGoldricksaid, “but there’s a liquidity crisis,” partly caused by the West Bank–basedPalestinian Authority’sinability to pay its approximately 40,000 civil servants in Gaza.Supplies are short, too. Typically,10,000 trucks come in every month carrying essential goods for the enclave; about 6,000 arrive now, he said. Israel and Egypt control access to the Gaza Strip."
A Moral Case Against the Israeli Hostage Deal,2023-11-22,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"Early this morning, Hamas and Israel agreed to a hostage deal: 30 children and 20 women will return to Israel, in exchange for five days of cease-fire and 150Palestinianswho are in Israeli custody and have been accused or convicted of serious crimes. Each additional 10 Israeli hostages freed will buy another day of respite from fighting. In arguing for the deal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the return of hostages “a sacred duty” and quoted the 12th-century sage Maimonides, to the effect that redeeming Jewish prisoners (pidyon shvuyim) is a great mitzvah. (Islam commands a similar duty to free prisoners.) Netanyahu omitted mention of the various restrictions on this blessed activity—the most important of which is not tooverpay for hostages, or do anything else that might encourage more hostage-taking. The far-right segment of his government split on the deal, with three ministers from the very-very-far-right Otzma Yehudit voting nay and 35 others consenting. The only-slightly-less-far-right Religious Zionist Party eventually voted yes on the deal.For the moment, the mood inside Israel is tentative relief—which will turn to immense relief the moment the children start crossing the border and running into their families’ arms. (Two of the Israeli children on the exchange list are relatives of Yifat Zaila, whom Ispoke within Israel a few weeks ago.) Under these circumstances, one understands why Netanyahu might have ignored the other part of Maimonides’s recommendation. Anyone who wants to think about cold calculus now, however, might consider a document that makes the case against paying for the freedom of hostages. “We maintain that no compensation should be given” for the freedom of the innocent, it says. To pay for freedom would be “a surrender of the great fundamental principle” that hostages are not the property of hostage-takers, and that “if compensation is to be given at all, it should be given to the outraged and guiltless” victims of the crime, rather than to the criminals themselves."
Is Israel at War With Iran?,2023-10-08,TheAtlantic,['Arash Azizi'],"The October 7 attacks on Israel by the Palestinian terror groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are being compared to 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. In fact, with more than 600 Israelis dead at the time of this writing, the proportional death toll is several times higher than that of 9/11, and the factor of surprise is arguably greater than at Pearl Harbor.But 9/11 and Pearl Harbor weren’t just tragic attacks. They were casus belli for seismic wars. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has declared his country to be heading into “a long and grueling war.” The air attacks he ordered in Gaza have already resulted in hundreds of Palestinian casualties. Will October 7 also lead to a broader conflagration in the region? Most important, can Israel rightly consider itself to be engaged in a shadow conflict with Iran?Manycommentatorsscoff at bringing Iran into an analysis of Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians. The sentiment is understandable. Some Beltwaypunditsname-drop Iran primarily to drive their own agendas. And the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily about Iran: It is rooted in Israel’s decades-long occupation of Palestinian territories, its brutal siege of the Gaza Strip, and its deprivation of dignity to millions of Palestinians under its rule."
It’s Foreign Policy That Distinguishes Bernie This Time,2019-02-21,TheAtlantic,['Peter Beinart'],"The conventional wisdom is that Bernie Sanders is a victim of his own success. His “populist agenda has helped push the party to the left,”declaredThe New York Timesin its story about his presidential announcement. But in 2020, he may lose “ground to newer faces who have adopted many of his ideas.”There’s an obvious truth here: From a $15 national minimum wage to Medicare for all to free college tuition, Sanders’s opponents have embraced policies that were considered radical when he first proposed them during the 2016 campaign. But what theTimesmisses is that there’s another policy realm where Sanders may find it easier to carve out a distinctly lefty niche: America’s relationship to the rest of the world.In 2016, foreign policy was the area where Sanders distinguished himself least. For the first five months of his candidacy, his campaign websitedidn’t even include a foreign-policy section. At adebateon November 14, 2015, when the moderator, John Dickerson, asked Sanders about the ISIS attacks that had killed more than 100 people in France the previous day, the Vermont senator dispatched the subject in a mere two sentences and then pivoted to domestic affairs."
"For Palestinians, No Help Is Coming",2017-12-07,TheAtlantic,['Dalia Hatuqa'],"President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the U.S. embassy there stunned many observers. Who would’ve thought we’d see such a dramatic break from U.S. policy on the city’s status? What about the implications for the two-state solution, the hallmark of the decades-long peace process between Israel and the Palestinians? How could this happen?A better question is: How could thisnothappen? For the last 25 years, the peace process has been hurtling toward this very moment. Decades of playing the lopsided negotiations game has brought us face-to-face with the simple truth that the Palestinians pay a serious price for not negotiating—indeed, their lands are taken by Israeli settlements, some people are jailed and killed, and many are forced to eke out an existence on the margins of the Israeli economy—while the Israelis do not. Israel has had comparatively little motivation to negotiate when, with U.S. cover, it has been allowed to continue the status quo of occupying the West Bank and blockading the Gaza Strip.For many ordinary Palestinians, the move simply reinforced what they already believed: The U.S. was never an honest broker between the two parties, and the pipe dream of pursuing statehood under a historic peace deal is over. The peace process was always just a fig leaf foisted upon the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was left with very few other options but to participate as Arab countries expelled it from their capitals throughout the 1970s and 1980s."
The Supreme Court Considers the Algorithm,2023-02-01,TheAtlantic,['Kaitlyn Tiffany'],"When the Ninth Circuit Court of Appealsconsidereda lawsuit against Google in 2020, Judge Ronald M. Gould stated his view of the tech giant’s most significant asset bluntly: “So-called ‘neutral’ algorithms,” he wrote, can be “transformed into deadly missiles of destruction by ISIS.”According to Gould, it was time to challenge the boundaries of a little snippet of the 1996 Communications Decency Act known as Section 230, which protects online platforms from liability for the things their users post. The plaintiffs in this case, the family of a young woman who was killed during a 2015 Islamic State attack in Paris, alleged that Google had violated the Anti-terrorism Act by allowing YouTube’s recommendation system to promote terrorist content. The algorithms that amplified ISIS videos were a danger in and of themselves, they argued.Gould was in the minority, and the case was decided in Google’s favor. But even the majority cautioned that the drafters of Section 230—people whose conception of the World Wide Web might have been limited to the likes of email and the Yahoo homepage—never imagined “the level of sophistication algorithms have achieved.” The majority wrote that Section 230’s “sweeping immunity” was “likely premised on an antiquated understanding” of platform moderation, and that Congress should reconsider it. The case then headed to the Supreme Court."
Iran’s Response to Soleimani’s Killing Is Coming,2020-01-14,TheAtlantic,['Sam Dagher'],"BEIRUT—About two years ago, Qassem Soleimani delivered a speech at a ceremony in Tehran marking a decade since the death of Imad Mughniyeh, the senior Hezbollah commander killed in a car-bomb explosion in the heart of Damascus, an attackcarried out by the CIAwith support from Israel. Standing in front of a huge portrait of Mughniyeh superimposed against a panorama of Jerusalem,Soleimani addressed an audienceof senior Iranian officials, as well as representatives of Iran’s proxy militias in Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Syria, and Yemen.Soleimani hailed Mughniyeh as “the legend” responsible for practically all the achievements of Iran’s so-called axis of resistance, which according to the Iranian general included building Hezbollah and the Palestinian group Hamas into formidable threats to Israel andkilling 241 American service membersin the 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. “The enemy knows that punishment for Imad’s blood is not firing a missile or a tit-for-tat assassination,” he told the crowd. “The punishment for Imad’s blood is the eradication of the Zionist entity.”"

Shimon Peres: The Last Link to Israel's Founding Fathers,2016-09-28,TheAtlantic,['David A. Graham'],"The death of a statesman like Shimon Peres, who spent more than 60 years in public service, would mark a towering milestone in any nation. But in Israel, one of the world’s younger states, it takes on particular significance, as he represented one of the few remaining links to Israel’s founding generation. Peres, who was 93, was a first-hand witness and often a central participant in every moment in its history.In addition to Israel’s youth—it’s less than 70 years old—and Peres’s longevity, the country’s political class has proven unusually long-lived, with leaders remaining part of government for decades on end. It helped that Peres belonged to the Labor Party, which dominated Israeli politics for decades, until a more recent period in the wilderness. It’s impossible to come up with an American analogue for Peres’s 67-year career. It would as though an aide-de-camp to George Washington had retired during the James Buchanan administration, after a career with turns as ambassador, secretary of state, and senator.Peres was born in what was then Poland and what is now Belarus in 1923, but his family moved to Mandatory Palestine, then under British control, in 1932. When he arrived, he attended a school named for Arthur Balfour, who issued the 1917 British statement of support for a Jewish state—still a recent memory.In 1947, Peres joined the Haganah, the predecessor of the Israel Defense Forces. While serving at Haganah headquarters that year, he met David Ben-Gurion, who would become Israel’s first prime minister, and Levi Eshkol, who would be the third. Peres became head of naval services in 1948, the year of the war of independence, and the following year Ben-Gurion sent him to the United States to work on arms procurement for the nascent state. In 2014,he boasted toThe Washington Postthat he had worked with 10 presidents over the course of his career."
Our Special Forces’ Capacity to Evolve Despite Failure,2023-10-03,TheAtlantic,['Andrew Exum'],"Thirty years ago today, the U.S. military was involved in a brief but brutal battle in Somalia. In a series of firefights over two bloody days, 18 members of America’s most elite Special Forces and hundreds of Somali militiamen were killed. This was the Battle of Mogadishu, which the journalist Mark Bowden (now anAtlanticcontributing writer) famously reported forThePhiladelphia Inquirerand later adapted as the book and the filmBlack Hawk Down.Although the American units involved fought courageously, and inflicted heavy losses on their adversaries, the Battle of Mogadishu exposed significant weaknesses in U.S. Special Operations Forces’ capability. The televised images of dead Americans being dragged down dusty streets were scarring not only for the Clinton administration, and the American public viewing them on the evening news, but also for the units themselves.As painful as defeats are, lost battles can end up being the greatest teachers for military organizations. The battle marked an important waypoint in the evolution of our Special Operations Forces, and to this day carries important lessons for them."
"Finally, a President Who Looks at Jerusalem Logically",2017-12-06,TheAtlantic,['Einat Wilf'],"President Trump was correct when he said Wednesday that recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital is “nothing more nor less than a recognition of reality—it is also the right thing to do.” In fact, the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital is 68 years overdue.Jerusalem was established as the capital of the newly independent state of Israel on December 13, 1949. This was Jerusalem west of the ceasefire line delineated at the end of the war for Israel’s independence, later to be known as the pre-1967 line. This part of Jerusalem included Jewish residential neighborhoods built in preceding decades. There was nothing holy about this part of Jerusalem. By the end of the war the holy and ancient sites were actually east of the ceasefire line: the entire Old City, including the sites holiest to the Jewish people. The Temple Mount, the Wailing Wall, and the Jewish Quarter all came under Jordanian control, and Jews were denied access to these sites.The United States recognized the State of Israel upon its independence, so it should have been straightforward for the U.S. to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to establish its embassy there. If anything, it is the Jordanian annexation of the Old City and the way Jews were denied access that should have led to international consternation (it didn’t).Why didn’t the U.S. and all other countries recognize residential, non-holy, west-of-the-armistice-line Jerusalem as Israel’s capital? At the time the U.S. was still attached to an idea, proposed in the United Nations partition resolution of 1947, that the vast area of greater Jerusalem (including residential neighborhoods) as well as Bethlehem should be a “Corpus Separatum,” a separate area that would be governed by the international community."
Ratcliffe’s Withdrawal Reveals Trump Still Doesn’t Understand Appointments,2019-08-02,TheAtlantic,['David A. Graham'],"Updated on August 2 at 2:35 p.m.In March 2004, Attorney General John Ashcroft entered George Washington University Hospital with severe pancreatitis. Ashcroft had designated Deputy Attorney General James Comey as the acting attorney general while he was incapacitated.Meanwhile, at the White House, top officials in George W. Bush’s administration were hoping to approve a terror-related surveillance program as part of the War on Terror. But Comey and Jack Goldsmith, the director of the Office of Legal Counsel—which advises the president on what he can legally do—were both resisting, viewing the program as illegal. Seeking to bypass them, White House Chief of Staff Andy Card and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales went to Ashcroft’s hospital room, hoping he would overrule the decision. Comey and Goldsmith, getting wind of the plan, rushed to intercept them.The officials found themselves in a standoff in the hospital room.

"‘You Started a War, You’ll Get a Nakba’",2023-10-25,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"Last week, on a dusty road in the West Bank, I received a phone call from the office of the spokesperson of the Israel Defense Forces to schedule a meeting the next day. “Hello,” I said. “It’s difficult to talk right now. I am being menaced by two men with knives.”“Are they Jewish or Arab?” he asked. He sounded concerned.“Jewish.”His level of concern didn’t change. No one ever said being a spokesperson for Israel was an easy job. “Do you want me to talk to them?”About a minute earlier, these two young men had driven their beat-up white car in front of my Mazda and screamed at me in Hebrew, gesturing for me to pull over and get out. They wore IDF-style olive-drab pants, although their tops were civilian. On their waists they had long, fixed-blade Nimrav-style combat knives, and on their heads, the style of kippah and the sidelocks of hair,payot, common among West Bank settlers."
India Isn’t Signing Up for China’s New World Order,2023-10-17,TheAtlantic,['Michael Schuman'],"The Chinese leader Xi Jinping welcomed delegations from across the developing world to Beijing today to celebrate his pet project, the Belt and Road Initiative. The forum, the third of its kind, is meant to display China’s influence in the global South and show that Washington’s efforts to isolate and pressure Beijing can’t succeed: China simply has too many friends.But one very important person was absent. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government have steadfastly refused to join Xi’s infrastructure-building program and have promoted alternatives instead. Just last month, Modi and U.S. President Joe Biden announced a joint project to connect India to Europe through the Middle East by rail and ship.Modi’s absence from the Belt and Road forum is a sign that the rivalry between the United States and China is not the only one shaping global affairs. Another, between India and China, may have geopolitical consequences that are equally important. At stake are the shape of the global South and its role in international governance. Whose vision prevails—Xi’s or Modi’s—will help determine the future of the world order and American global power."
I Don’t See a Better Way Out,2023-10-24,TheAtlantic,['Ned Lazarus'],"There are those who see a nonviolent way forward in Gaza right now: A cease-fire, an exchange of prisoners for hostages, a UN protectorate. I envy them, whatever clear answer they might have to how Israel should respond to the massacre of more than 1,400 Israelis and the kidnapping of more than 200 others by a fundamentalist terrorist organization that rules over and hides among an impoverished civilian population of 2 million people. I envy those who know exactly how Hamas can be stopped without any more killing, any more suffering, for any more people in Israel and Gaza.Because I don’t.I have dedicated much of my professional life to seeking peaceful change in this conflict, trying to listen to and understand Israelis and Palestinians and find ways to work toward peace or justice or coexistence or mutual understanding or anything better than what there is now. For eight years, starting in 1996, I worked for Seeds of Peace in Jerusalem, promoting peaceful conflict resolution with hundreds of young Palestinians and Israelis, their families, and their communities. I’ve spent the years since researching, writing, and teaching about Israeli-Palestinian peace-building. So many people whom I love and admire are now caught in this nightmare, including Vivian Silver, a 74-year-old Israeli peace activist who disappeared from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7 and is presumed to have been kidnapped, and the families of numerous friends in Gaza. I see no way out of the nightmare so long as Hamas continues to rule the Gaza Strip, and no viable way to remove it from power without an Israeli ground offensive."
‘How Much Can This Child Take?’,2023-11-07,TheAtlantic,['Franklin Foer'],"On the nightof Friday, October 6, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg laid their hands on the head of their 23-year-old son, Hersh, so that they could bless him, a ritual of the Sabbath. They recited in Hebrew:May you feel God’s presence within you always, and may you find peace.It was an exquisitely temperate Jerusalem evening, and the Goldberg-Polin family made the most of it, dining al fresco at a long table of friends. Hersh’s presence was an unexpected blessing. He had only recently returned from several months of traveling across Europe by himself, occasionally meeting up with his boyhood friends. Earlier in the week, Hersh had told his mother that he would be away for the weekend, attending a music festival in the north. But that festival’s organizers had neglected to obtain the necessary permits, and the event ended prematurely.As Rachel stared at her son from across the table, she marveled at his hard-earned sense of ease. When the Goldberg-Polin family emigrated from Richmond, Virginia, in 2008, when Hersh was 7, he had initially struggled to adapt, to learn the language, to shake his sense of being an outsider. But here he was, vividly recounting picaresque stories of his time abroad. He said that the thing he’d enjoyed most about Europe was that he didn’t need to bathe, because rivers were so ubiquitous and he could always plunge into one."
Trump Is Reinventing the U.S. Approach to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict,2018-09-20,TheAtlantic,"['Robert Malley, Aaron David Miller']","Recent months have seen a series of dramatic steps by the Trump administration with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict:moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, defunding the agency responsible for Palestinian refugees, cutting West Bank aid, shutting down the PLO mission in Washington, and persistently promising to present its own peace plan. The flurry of activity comes even as the prospects of an actual deal seem increasingly remote. The Palestinian leadership has made clear it won’t so much as glance at any U.S. proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested there would be no harm in taking more time before unveiling it, and Arab leaders whose support, or at least acquiescence, the administration deems crucial to the enterprise have voiced their own qualms and politely distanced themselves from the initiative. By now, it would be hard to find anyone serious who takes seriously the notion that the Trump administration will achieve the “ultimate deal.” Which raises the more interesting question: What, exactly, is the Trump team up to?It being the Trump administration, the answer is not entirely straightforward. But this much is clear: Notwithstanding its repeated vows to the contrary, the primary goal of an administration that has given up on the current Palestinian leadership isn’t to encourage or pressure President Abbas to come to the table. By now, even the Trump team must know that won’t happen. Rather, the objective is to fundamentally reframe the U.S.’s understanding of, and policy toward, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, shifting the focus toward Palestinians’ material, economic concerns while downplaying their political and national ones."
‘The Country’s Already Been Destroyed’,2023-07-26,TheAtlantic,['Daniel Gordis'],"Eran Schwartzlooks like a fighter pilot. The 40-something appeared last week on the Israeli television showOfira and Berkowitz—a black V-neck T-shirt over his trim, athletic chest; his black hair cut short—to defend his decision to end his service in the air-force reserves. “We’re not the ones who tore up the social contract,” he said. “We swore to serve a state that is Jewish and democratic. And if Netanyahu is going to end Israel’s being a liberal democracy, it’s the country that violated the contract, not us.”Member of the Knesset Matan Kahana, another pilot on the show, agreed with Schwartz that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was dragging the country to “the destruction of the Third Temple.” He insisted, though, that the pilots were wrong to end their service, “because that’s Judgment Day weaponry.” And he warned of the consequences: “Refusal to serve will destroy the army; it will rip the country apart.”“And the country isn’t already being ripped apart?” Ofira Asayag, one of the hosts, shot back. “The country’s already been destroyed.”In that one line,Asayag captured precisely what millions of Israelis are feeling. The political crisis in Israel is no longer about being in favor of the judicial reform the Netanyahu government pledged to enact, or about opposing it. It is no longer about law; it is about the almost complete erosion of any trust millions of citizens have in the government. It is about the sense here that something deep, sacred to many, has broken, the feeling that, as Asayag put it, “the country’s already been destroyed.”Later in the show, she asked Schwartz the tough question his stand provokes: “If there’s an emergency, if we’re attacked, are you or are you not getting in a plane?” Schwartz dodged. Asayag saw him squirming, heard his voice cracking, stared him in the eye, and asked him a question Israelis hardly ever ask a fighter pilot: “Why are you crying?”“I’m not crying,” Schwartz replied."

Let the Activists Have Their Loathsome Rallies,2023-10-18,TheAtlantic,['Thomas Chatterton Williams'],"Sitting on an outdoor bench at Bard College on Thursday, I watched a procession of several dozen students weave its way across the New York State campus. A young white man with a bullhorn in his hand and a kaffiyeh around his neck led the group in chants of “Long live the intifada” and “No peace on stolen land.” The protesters displayed Palestinian flags and banners that provocatively readfrom the river to the sea. Although some observers almost certainly disagreed with the message, others stood up and applauded the students as they passed. All of this transpired peacefully, if obnoxiously, and after five minutes the area was silent again.Like many Americans, I am appalled by the student and political organizations that have excused or, in some cases, rallied in celebration of the October 7 Hamas attack on Jewish civilians, the deadliest single-day assault on Jews in Israel’s history. But I am also grateful to call home a country where such rallies are permissible and where, despite the illiberal criticism of open debate that became fashionable in the summer of 2020, freedom of expression still prevails."
Israel's New Law Inflames the Core Tension in Its Identity,2018-07-21,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"Israel passed a law this week that has been floating around the Knesset for a half-dozen years. Branded the “nation-state bill,” the legislation declares that Israel is the historic homeland of the Jewish people, and that “the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” It establishes Hebrew as the official language of Israel and downgrades Arabic to a language with “special status,” even though many people in Israel’s sizeable Arab minority primarily speak in Arabic. The law also asserts that Jewish settlement—without specifying where—is a national value, and promises to encourage and advance settlement efforts.Some liberal Jews, especially outside of Israel, are outraged. “The damage that will be done by this new nation-state law to the legitimacy of the Zionist vision … is enormous,” wrote Rick Jacobs, the head of the U.S.-based Union for Reform Judaism, in a press release. J Street, a liberal Zionist organization, called it “a sad day for Israel and all who care about its democracy and its future.”"
The Palestinian Lawsuit Against the Balfour Declaration,2016-07-28,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"Updated on July 29 at 12:41 p.m.NEWS BRIEFMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian National Authority president, said the Palestinian Authority would sue Britain for its support of the Balfour Declaration, a document which in 1917 laid the groundwork for Israel’s founding, according toHaaretz.The announcement was made on Abbas’ behalf by Riad Maliki, the Palestinian foreign minister, on Wednesday at the opening of the 27th Arab League summit in Nouakchott, Mauritania. Maliki said the suit, which would be filed in an international court, would be made on the grounds that British support for establishing a Jewish homeland in Mandate Palestine led to the Palestiniannakba, or “catastrophe.” Palestinians use the term to describe the displacement of approximately 700,000 Palestinians following the creation of Israel in 1948.Maliki said the issue will remain pending until Britain apologizes.The 1917 Balfour Declaration was a written correspondence between Arthur Balfour, the then-British foreign secretary, and Walter Rothschild, a leader in the British Jewish community. It established Britain’s support for the creation of a Jewish national home, and was adopted by the international community after World War II."
What Ilhan Omar Actually Said,2021-06-14,TheAtlantic,['Elizabeth Bruenig'],"By the time Republicans and centrist Democrats had united late last week to scold Representative Ilhan Omar for a tweet—one of the few pastimes that still draw the two parties together, and something thoseselfsamechiderswould doubtlessly decry, under different circumstances, ascancel cultureorcensorship—it no longer mattered what, exactly, Omar had said. They had already managed to make a news cycle out of it: mission accomplished.Now, following Democratic outrage and Republicancallsfor afloor voteto strip Omar of her committee assignments, let me record the following for posterity: Omar demonstrably did not say what she’s been accused of having said; what shedidsay was true; and every politico using this opportunity to take a swing at her likely knows those two things—they just think you don’t.What did Omar say? Context is key. In 2020, the Trump administration imposedsanctionson International Criminal Court prosecutors who moved to investigate potential U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan as well as potential Israeli crimes in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, arguing that because the U.S. and Israel aren’t members of the ICC, the court has no right to adjudicate such matters. (The ICCrecognizesthe State of Palestine as a party to its governing statute, a decision that the U.S.insiststhe ICC lacks the power to make.) Omar vocallyopposedthe sanctions—as did theEuropean Union, thepresident of the ICC’s Assembly of States Parties, SenatorPatrick Leahy, and, presumably, anyone skeptical of America’s willingness to look into its ownsavagery abroad."
Israel’s Prince of Paradoxes,2019-08-30,TheAtlantic,['Michael Oren'],"Saul thought, “I’ll pin David to the wall,” and twice threw a spear, but David dodged it both times.So the prophet Samuel describes the tragic relationship between a weakened king and his former protégé, a drama that is now recurring in Israeli politics. Benjamin Netanyahu—master strategist, ruthless politician—is in fact no Saul, nor is Avigdor Lieberman a fair-haired harpist. Yet the purported decline in Netanyahu’s powers and the palpable rise of Lieberman’s have biblical overtones. Only, this time, it is David hurling the spears.Almost daily, Lieberman, the former Israeli defense minister, impugns the prime minister’s fitness for office, assailing him as a liar and a closet leftist who gave a long list of concessions to the Palestinians—in the 1998 Wye Agreement with Yasser Arafat, the 2011 prisoner exchange with Hamas, and, most egregious, Israel’s agreement to transfer Qatari cash to Gaza’s terrorists. Lieberman, by contrast, resigned from four Israeli governments rather than back what he termed “disastrous” acts of weakness. He’s even challenged Netanyahu to a televised debate. “Let’s have a confrontation between the man from Caesarea and the man from Nokdim,” he declared—that is, between the upscale coastal neighborhood where Netanyahu owns a villa and the modest West Bank settlement where Lieberman lives."
Israel Must Not React Stupidly,2023-10-12,TheAtlantic,['George Packer'],"If 10/7 was Israel’s 9/11, as many of the country’s leaders have said, the meaning of the comparison is not self-evident. Its implications still have to be worked out, and they might lead to unexpected places.The horror is comparable, but the scale isn’t. The 1,000 or more civilians butchered on Saturday by Hamas are, relative to Israel’s population, many more than the 3,000 killed in the United States by al-Qaeda; a proportionate number of dead on 9/11 would have been close to 40,000. Al-Qaeda, a transnational group based in the deserts and mountains of Afghanistan, had the ability and will to strike terror anywhere in the world, but it could not destroy the United States. Hamas threatens Israel’s very existence—both in principle, according to thegenocidal goalsset out in its founding manifesto and subsequent statements, and also in practice, as an arm or ally of the more powerful entities in the region that share its aims: Hezbollah, Syria, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Facts like these suggest that the analogy has no more value than most historical comparisons.And yet something makes Israelis reach back to September 11, 2001. The facts are different, but the feelings are the same: profound shock, unbearable grief, humiliation, rage, and solidarity. Shock because nothing this terrible had ever happened before, even to Israel. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, like the George W. Bush administration, seemed to discount evidence of a coming attack—a failure of intelligence and preparedness that was, perhaps, at bottom a failure of imagination. Solidarity demonstrated in the spontaneous effort of ordinary Israelis, without waiting for official directives, regardless of ideological differences, to save and comfort one another. Ours didn’t last long; neither will theirs. May the memory endure as a reproach to the stupidity and tribalism that plague Israeli politics and ours."
National Cuisine Is a Useful Illusion,2022-02-15,TheAtlantic,['Reem Kassis'],"My first daughter was born in a London hospital, but her surroundings soon felt very Palestinian. By 6 a.m. the morning after she arrived, my mother had broughtijjeh(a herb frittata often made for new mothers) stuffed inside a pita slathered withlabneh(a strained yogurt) to my bedside. In the afternoon, she returned withhilbeh(a fenugreek-semolina cake), purported to improve milk supply. The feast continued once we went home:maghlee(a caraway rice pudding) to celebrate the birth,hashweh (a cinnamon-and-nutmeg-infused rice-and-lamb pilaf) for dinner, andtaboonbread on the weekends. The dishes of my childhood provided me not only comfort, but also a conduit to my heritage. I was not alone in my fresh role as a parent nor in my adopted country. Six weeks later, my mother flew back to Jerusalem, where I was raised, and I found myself with a newborn in a home now void of its familiar aromas. I panicked.Since moving abroad, I had seen the food I grew up eatingcharacterizedhazily as Middle Eastern or evenIsraeli. It was only one facet of an identity that was questioned at every turn. My family and I are descendants of Palestinians whose villages, if neither depopulated nor destroyed during the 1948 Israeli-Palestinian War, ended up within Israel’s new borders. Such people form an estimated 20 percent of Israel’s population, and are frequently labeled Israeli Arabs. Often, we’re told that Palestinians don’t even exist."
A Knife Fight in a Phone Booth,2023-11-07,TheAtlantic,['Elliot Ackerman'],"Twenty years ago, on what looked like a movie set built in the Quantico woods, I learned how to fight in a city. This faux city was called “MOUT Town.”MOUT—Military Operations in Urban Terrain—is U.S. military-speak for high-intensity urban combat, like what’s unfolding in Gaza. Tactically, MOUT was very different from the traditional combat we’d already studied in the Marine Corps. The urban battlefield was highly constricted; streets and buildings funneled us into close quarters with our enemy. Beyond every corner, window, or doorway lurked a potential ambush. Most notably, and adding a specific and complex layer to this type of warfare, civilians blended with adversaries, all played by instructors who ambushed us with paintball guns. Casualty rates in urban warfare far exceed those of other forms of combat, a fact reinforced by the dime-size paintball welts that covered my body by the end of MOUT week.Less than a year later, in November 2004, I found myself leading a 46-man rifle platoon into Falluja, in Iraq. This battle pitted 13,000 Marines and soldiers against a defending force of 4,000 al-Qaeda fighters. In staging areas outside the city, we drilled the urban tactics we’d learned in MOUT Town. Chief among those tactics was close-quarters battle, or CQB, a highly choreographed maneuver designed for hostage rescue in which a group of Marines enters a room and clears it of threats. These tactics look similar to what usually appears in movies featuring Navy SEALs or Delta Force operatives as they rescue hostages; it is a familiar, if violent, visual. The idea is to flood a room with so much speed and precision that you overwhelm a defending adversary; your enemy might be able to shoot the first man through the door, or even the second, but they’ll be killed by the third or fourth. In these situations, a room’s door isn’t even called a door; it’s called the “fatal funnel.” The first man knows he’s likely going to get shot—that’s his job."
The Rift Over Israel in Britain's Labour Party,2016-04-28,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"Updated on April 28 at 10:00 a.m. ETFormer London Mayor Ken Livingstone has been suspended by the opposition Labour Party afterhe said Thursday during a BBC interview: “Let’s remember, when Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.”There was outrage at his remarks and calls for suspension, which culminated on Thursday with this statement from the party:Livingstone, the London mayor from 2000 to 2008, is known for his controversial remarks and left-wing politics, which earned him the moniker “Red Ken.”The events that led to Livingstone’s suspension from the party had their most recent origins in comments by Naz Shah, a Labour member of Parliament, on her Facebook page before she became a lawmaker last year. Among those that drew attention, and criticism, was one in which an outline of Israel was superimposed on a map of the U.S. with the headline: “Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict—relocate Israel into United States.” The comment on the post: “Problem solved.”"
The Coming Middle East Conflagration,2019-11-04,TheAtlantic,['Michael Oren'],"This article was updated on Monday, November 4, at 7:35 pm.The senior ministers of the Israeli government met twice last week to discuss the possibility of open war with Iran. They were mindful of the Iranian plan for a drone attack from Syria in August, aborted at the last minute byan Israeli air strike, as well as Iran’s need to deflect attention from the mass protests against Hezbollah’s rule in Lebanon. The ministers also reviewed the recent attack by Iranian drones and cruise missiles on two Saudi oil installations, reportedly concluding that a similar assault could be mounted against Israel from Iraq.The Israel Defense Forces, meanwhile, announced the adoption of an emergency plan, code-named Momentum, to significantly expand Israel’s missile defense capacity, its ability to gather intelligence on embedded enemy targets, and its soldiers’ preparation for urban warfare. Israeli troops, especially in the north, have been placed on war footing. Israel is girding for the worst and acting on the assumption that fighting could break out at any time."

How the Six-Day War Transformed Religion,2017-06-05,TheAtlantic,['Sigal Samuel'],"Fifty years ago this week, the Six-Day War dramatically altered geographic borders and political fortunes in the Middle East. For Israelis, the stunning 1967 victory meant an expanded country that suddenly included East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula; for Palestinians, it meant occupation and more displacement; for surrounding Arab countries, it meant crushing military and reputational defeat.But the Six-Day War didn’t only transform Middle East politics: It also transformed religion—in ways that would reverberate far beyond the region. The war’s outcome impacted the way Islam is expressed in the West Bank and Gaza, and it created new openings for political Islamism in the Arab world. It strengthened a messianic strain in Israeli Judaism, and it changed the focal point of American Judaism. It forced an internal reckoning among evangelical Christians, and even among Mormons, in the United States.I asked writers with expertise and experience in each of these contexts to discuss how 1967 changed religion, broadly interpreted. Religion is often thought of as a force that drives conflict; I invited them to think instead about how conflict impacts religion. The six writers’ responses, which I’ve edited and included below, touch on everything from fashion to theology, demonstrating the many ways religion inflects people’s lives."
America Is Lucky That Biden’s in Charge,2023-10-25,TheAtlantic,['Michael McFaul'],"President Joe Biden and his national-security team began their time in office in 2021 intending to concentrate on confronting China’s rise. The state of the world has not allowed such a singular focus. First came the American withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban’s return to power. Next was Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Now Hamas has carried out its barbaric terrorist attack against Israeli citizens, triggering a forceful response from Israel and potentially a major interstate war in the Middle East.Americans are lucky to have President Biden and his foreign-policy team in charge of national security right now. Their experience and knowledge extend not just to China and Asia but to the world, and they have made smart moves in defense of American interests and values.From the start, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Biden both traveled to Israel to signal strong American support for a democratic ally. In times of crisis, allies need to show up; once there, Blinken and Biden delivered appropriate messages about shared values, Israel’s right to self-defense, and Hamas’s illegitimacy and terrorist intent. Biden also pledged more military assistance to Israel and requested that Congress secure the necessary funds. (It would be nice if the majority in our House of Representatives could show a little more leadership during this time of crisis, but that’s another matter.)"
Talking About Gaza in a Jerusalem Hospital,2023-12-06,TheAtlantic,['Pesach Lichtenberg'],"For most of my career, working as a psychiatrist in Jerusalem, I have run locked wards, serving people in distressed states who cannot remain in the community because of their need for round-the-clock care.This life, indeed much life in Israel, feels precarious right now. The first air-raid sirens in more than a week have begun sounding in Jerusalem as I write. The comparisons between the Hamas attack of October 7 and the Holocaust reveal the extent to which our complacency has been shattered.That the residents of Gaza have it far worse is undeniably true. My 6-year-old son drew a self-portrait depicting himself supine, a bomb descending upon him, and I got upset. I would not trade places with the families carrying their bloodied children into the emergency rooms of Gaza, with no place but the floor to rest them between the wounded and dead. Just writing these words, I cry. And I’m outraged that Hamas could knowingly, willingly, invite this retribution for the atrocities it inflicted."
What Is Israel Trying to Accomplish?,2023-10-17,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read fromThe Atlantic, Monday through Friday.Sign up for it here.Israel’s invasion of Gaza awaits the parting of clouds. Clear skies favor Israel, which dominates the airspace and wants to be able to look down to see what awaits its ground forces. Early morning yesterday brought rain, and at dawn, orange cumulus clouds rolled over the Mediterranean. Today’s forecast calls for more rain, and therefore probably another day without Israeli infantry in Gaza. Rarely has the Weather Channel been such ominous and thrilling viewing.Everyone knows the invasion is coming. Less obvious is what it will ultimately bring for Palestinians. Within about a day of Hamas’s attack on October 7, an Israeli consensus emerged that no response short of total annihilation of Hamas would suffice. A second, corollary consensus didn’t take much longer: To annihilate Hamas, Israel would have to invade Gaza. Hamas has given Israel the best possible excuse to do so. Hamas hides in the civilian population, stores its weapons there, and fires those weapons from civilian areas. It does this by choice. And that gives Israel the rationale of self-defense, the most ironclad right of either a person or a nation."
Party of One,2023-08-24,TheAtlantic,['Peter Wehner'],"This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read fromThe Atlantic, Monday through Friday.Sign up for it here.Last night’s GOP presidential debate featured eight candidates, none of them named Donald Trump, but it was the former president who won the night. His aggregate lead in the national polls is titanic—he is more than 40 points ahead of the fast-fading Ron DeSantis—and nothing that happened on the debate stage in Milwaukee will change that.Those who watched the debate will, for a few hours anyway, remember certain moments, good and bad, and take away certain impressions, positive and negative.For my part, I thought two former governors, Nikki Haley and Chris Christie, were the most impressive. Haley was particularly strong on foreign policy, lacerating Vivek Ramaswamy for his stances on Ukraine (hand it over to Russia), Israel (cut funding), and China (abandon Taiwan). “You don’t do that to friends,” the former United Nations ambassador said, attacking his stance on Israel. “What you do instead is you have the backs of your friends.” She added, “You have no foreign-policy experience, and it shows!” Haley also called out Republicans for promising in campaigns to cut spending and then, when in power—especially during the Trump presidency—increasing it."
Biden’s Test in the Middle East,2023-10-14,TheAtlantic,['The Editors'],"President Joe Biden is facing one of the most difficult tests in his decades of experience shaping U.S. foreign policy: how to support Israel in the war against Hamas while preventing additional conflict from breaking out in the region.Joining the editor in chief ofThe Atlanticand moderator, Jeffrey Goldberg, this week to discuss this and more: Susan Glasser, a staff writer atThe New Yorker; David Ignatius, a columnist atThe Washington Post; Mary Louise Kelly, a co-host ofAll Things Consideredon NPR; and Vivian Salama, a national-security reporter atThe New York Times."
London’s Day of Creeping Extremism,2023-11-11,TheAtlantic,['Helen Lewis'],"Updated at 10:15 a.m. ET on November 13, 2023How do youdecide who owns a country? At 10:30 this morning in London, a group of black-clad men were gathered about 100 meters from the Cenotaph, Britain’s most famous war memorial. They were chanting. “We want our country back,” went one refrain, followed by “You’re not English, you’re not English, you’re not English anymore.”This group was—as another of their chants put it—“Tommy’s Army.” That refers to Tommy Robinson, the pseudonym of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, aconvicted mortgage fraudsterwho is the former head of a far-right, anti-Muslim group called the English Defence League. Robinson was here, somewhere, in person—and as of last week, he was back on X (formerly Twitter), five years after being “permanently suspended.” Violence and disorder follow him around, so London’s Metropolitan Police haddrafted reinforcements from around Britainto deal with the situation. Walking down Whitehall, a long, open road stretching from Trafalgar Square to Westminster, I saw police vans from Durham and Northumbria, in the north of England, and some officers wore caps readingHEDDLU, the Welsh word for police.The police had penned Tommy’s Army into a narrow stretch of sidewalk, from which they were roaring and throwing the occasional bottle. Today is Armistice Day, which commemorates the end of World War I. Less than half an hour before Britain was due to observe two minutes of silence for its combat dead, I watched as the right-wing group charged the police line and broke through it, then seemed unsure what to do next."
The Three Biggest Misconceptions About Israel’s Upheaval,2023-04-10,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"For the past three months, Israelis have been protesting across the country against the attempted overhaul of their judicial system by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-right coalition. In February, a surveyfoundthat nearly one in five Israelis had taken part in a demonstration. This unprecedented activismculminatedin a national strike at the end of March that compelled Netanyahu to pause, but not abandon, his efforts to push through the legislation. Today, representatives of the two sides sat down to continue negotiations toward a potential compromise. Yet despite all the coverage these events have rightly received, I’ve noticed a fair number of fallacies circulating about why they came about and what’s driving them.Myth 1: The protests are about whether Israel should reform its judiciary.Internationalcoverageof the Israeli unrest often casts the controversy in binary terms: Some Israelis support judicial reform; others oppose it. But the story is more complicated. In fact, there is broad consensus that the country’s Supreme Court is overly powerful and should be reined in. At present, the body effectively appoints its own members and exercises authority over politicians and policy that is unique in the democratic world. Back in 2007, the American judge and legal commentator Richard PosnerlabeledAharon Barak—the Israeli chief justice most responsible for the expansion of the court’s capabilities—an “enlightened despot.” The leaders of several Israeli opposition parties havethemselvessoughtto correct this imbalance in Israel’s internal affairs."
Tense Days in Hebron,2017-01-28,TheAtlantic,['Zach Dorfman'],"Last year was a violent one in Hebron, the largest city in the West Bank. In March 2016, video footage filmed by a Palestinian and released by the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem showed Elor Azaria, a 20-year-old Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldier, shooting an incapacitated Palestinian attacker in an execution-style killing, in the city’s Tel Rumeida neighborhood. In late June 2016, a Palestinianstabbed a 13-year-old Jewish girlto death while she slept in her bed in Kiryat Arba, an Israeli settlement contiguous to Hebron. A Hamas terroristfired on a settlerfamily driving south of the city, killing the father, and injuring the mother and children in early July. (In response, the IDF imposed harsh travelrestrictionsfor the roughly 900,000 Palestinians in the Hebron district, and cut off all outside access to the nearby al-Fawar refugee camp for 26 days.) Stabbing and ramming attacks by Palestinians in the area continued over the fall; in many cases, the IDF killed the assailants.Then, in early January 2017, in a divisive verdict, a military court headed by three judges foundAzaria guilty of manslaughter. The verdict exacerbated tensions between the IDF and right-wing Israeli politicians whoexcoriated the militaryfor pursuing the case in the first place. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, and other Israeli politicians, haveeven called for Azaria’s pardon. When the verdict came down, the Netanyahu government was still reeling from the Obama administration’s decision in late December to abstain from vetoing a UN Security Council resolution reaffirming long-standing international consensus: that Israel’s settlement-building in the territories it has occupied since 1967 is illegal under international law. (Historically, U.S. officials have massaged the issue by calling settlements “obstacles to peace” and refrained from explicitly referencing their illegality.) Several days later, Secretary of State John Kerry delivered a speech on Israel and Palestine also largely recapitulating U.S. policy in the region.Again, the Netanyahu government howled in protest."
The Three Crises Sparked by Trump's Withdrawal From the Iran Deal,2018-05-08,TheAtlantic,['David Frum'],"President Trump has just pushed the plunger on a sequence of crises.The first will be a crisis with allies and other partners. Will they agree to reimpose their sanctions on Iran? It’s not justNATOcountries that will have to be cajoled or coerced. Complying with UN-voted sanctions, Indiareducedits dependence on Iranian crude oil from 13 percent of its imports in 2009–2010 to 5 percent in 2014–2015. Iran, the second-largest oil supplier to the world’s third-biggest oil importer before the sanctions hit, is rapidly recovering its market share—and Indiaplansto double its imports in the coming year. What’s the plan for getting India back on board?China has emerged as Iran’s largest trading partner. Its trade with Iranjumped30 percent in the first six months of 2017. China hasextendedcredits to Iran totaling some $35 billion, a significant sum for the shaky Iranian economy. Who will make China stop?America’s European allies have been more cautious about expanding trade with Iran. Yet will their publics allow their governments to follow the despised and distrusted Trump administration into an escalating confrontation with Iran? Fifty-six percent of Germansdescriberelations with the United States as bad or very bad.Trump has never valued allies or partners. The only relationship he understands is one of power: He commands; others obey. But on Iran, the most relevant partners are precisely those who cannot be compelled to obey. Perhaps he imagines he can blackmail them:Join me in imposing new sanctions or else I’ll start a war that you will like even less. That is a bluff at serious risk of being called.The second is a crisis with Iran itself. One bad consequence of President Obama’s 2015 deal is that Iran is now a better-armed, better-financed adversary than it was then. Thanks in great measure to Trump’s own decisions, Iran has also gained a big victory for Assad’s client regime in Syria. It can retaliate against U.S. interests in all kinds of ways. It can escalate its terror campaign against Israel by using Hezbollah and Hamas. It can green-light a hot war against Israel in Gaza. It can also accelerate its drive for outright nuclear-weapons-state status."
Democrats Are Falling Into the Ilhan Omar Trap,2019-04-14,TheAtlantic,['David Frum'],"Many of President Donald Trump’s tweets backfire, but not his tweetattackon U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar. That one tweet succeeded to perfection. Trump wishes to make Omar the face of the Democratic Party heading into the 2020 elections—and now he has provoked Democrats to comply.Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have offered full-throated endorsements of Omar. “Ilhan Omar is a leader with strength and courage. She won’t back down to Trump’s racism and hate, and neither will we. The disgusting and dangerous attacks against her must end,” Sanderstweeted. Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, and Pete Buttigieg have expressed themselves more circumspectly, but have still aligned themselves with her in ways not easy to undo. “We are stronger than this president’s hatred and Islamophobia. Do not let him drive us apart or make us afraid,” O’Rourketweeted. Of the 2020 hopefuls, only Amy Klobuchar added anycaveatto her statement about Omar. (“You can disagree with her words—as I have done before—but this video is wrong.”) Joe Biden and Cory Booker have thus far refrained from comment.Having promised not to “let him drive us apart” from Omar, Democrats are now stuck with responsibility for the reckless things the representative from Minnesota says, not only about Jews, but about other issues, too. Omar has already served notice that she does not intend to behave more circumspectly in the future. In a Friday-night interview, Stephen Colbert asked Omar whether she would heed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s advice to back-bench it for a while. Omar answered, “I think Nancy knows this very well. Women have been told to go slow and not be seen and not be heard for many years. She wouldn’t have made it to where she is if she did. And it’s certainly the case for minority women … We are not there to be quiet. We are not there to be invisible. We are there to follow the lead of people like Congressman John Lewis and make good trouble.”"
Why Aren’t We Evacuating Americans From Sudan?,2023-04-25,TheAtlantic,['Elliot Ackerman'],"On Saturday, Special Operations Forces successfullyevacuatedfewer than 100 U.S.-embassy personnel from Sudan. Then, in a startling break with American precedent, the State Department announced that it would not request further evacuations of trapped U.S. citizens from a country descending into violent conflict. There are currently 16,000 Americans reported in Sudan, and the U.S. embassy is in touch with at least several hundred who are actively trying to get out.The United States has, for decades, considered its commitment to its citizens abroad to be sacrosanct. For this reason, until very recently, the evacuation of noncombatants from conflict zones—known as a Noncombatant Evacuation Operation—was a relatively common and quintessentially American mission. When conditions deteriorate in a country, the U.S. ambassador can call for a NEO, and a Marine Expeditionary Unit or the Immediate Response Force of the 82nd Airborne will mobilize to get American citizens—not just American diplomats—evacuated to safety. During a NEO, the ambassador becomes the president’s direct representative on-site, in charge of coordinating who departs, how they depart, and when.No such effort is being proposed in Sudan. In acallwith the press over the weekend, State Department Undersecretary for Management John Bass said that “we don’t foresee coordinating a U.S. Government evacuation for our fellow citizens in Sudan at this time or in the coming days.” He also noted that the State Department has had a travel advisory in place for more than a decade cautioning Americans not to travel to Sudan."
"No Matter Who Wins the Syrian Civil War, Israel Loses",2018-08-29,TheAtlantic,['David Kenner'],"If you want to understand Israel’s ambivalence about the outcome of Syria’s war, look no further than Avigdor Lieberman. In 2016, Lieberman, Israel’s hawkish defense minister,condemnedBashar al-Assad, the president of Syria, as a “butcher.” He asserted Israel’s moral imperative to oppose genocide, born from the Holocaust, as a reason to oppose the Syrian government’s massacres. It is in Israel’s interest, headded, that Assad and his Iranian allies “be thrown out of Syria.” Fast forward to earlier this month. While touring Israeli air-defense units, Liebermanstruck an optimistic noteabout Assad’s gaining strength, saying it means “there is a real address, someone responsible, and central rule” in Syria. Asked whether he believed this would decrease the possibility of clashes on Israel’s northern border, he said: “I believe so. I think this is also in Assad’s interest.”Those two positions represent Israel’s conflicted priorities in Syria. On the one hand, Assad is Iran’s most important ally in the Arab world—the state he rules provides Tehran with access to Israel’s northern border, and facilitates the flow of weapons to Hezbollah. On the other hand, Assad—his government’s fiercely anti-Israel rhetoric notwithstanding—represents a known quantity to Israel, unlike the chaotic tangle of Sunni militias and jihadist organizations that would replace him. Until recently, Israel’s border with Syria had been its quietest frontier for four decades."
Why Israeli Security-Service Agents Wanted to Talk With Charlottesville’s Mayor,2023-11-09,TheAtlantic,['Michael Signer'],"During the fall of 2022, my family and I lived in Tel Aviv, where my wife and I were visiting professors at Reichman University, in Herzliya. I taught a class called “Democracy and Dictatorship.” It was a fraught time. Almost all of my students were in the military or veterans. Several were deeply concerned that Benjamin Netanyahu would bring a new era of antagonistic nationalism to Israel, at a time when they felt the country needed cohesion instead. One said she would likely leave the country if he won.As the former mayor of Charlottesville, Virginia, I was asked to speak at the university’s annual World Summit on Counter-Terrorism conference, on a panel about the dangers of far-right terrorism in the United States. In my presentation, I recounted a chilling conversation I’d had in June 2017 with a civil servant from the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism. He told me that Trump-administration officials had basically instructed his office to stop talking about white nationalists when they referred to domestic terrorism in the United States. He implied that this decision had been made for domestic political reasons.Two months later, Charlottesville was invaded by multiple violent white-nationalist militias who’d plotted their attack secretly on the gaming chat app Discord. Federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Department of Justice, supposedly dedicated to preventing just this sort of incident, were absent from the scene."
A Six-Figure Settlement on Campus Free Speech ,2015-11-12,TheAtlantic,['Adam Chandler'],"As debates roil overfree speech on American college campusesand as mechanisms that critique Israeli policiescontinue to divide, the universedelivered a perfect enmeshingof both stories in the Land of Lincoln.On Thursday, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign reached a settlement with Steven Salaita, a professor who had a job offer revoked by the school after he tweeted incendiary statements about Israel during the country’s war with Hamas in Gaza last summer.Here was one such tweet:The university was bombarded by letters from angry students, parents, donors, and alumni, which ultimately led to thescuttling of his appointmentby the college’s trustees. At the time, University Chancellor Phyllis Wise argued that Salaita’s beliefs were not the issue, but ratherthe tenor of his statements:"
Why the Most Hated Man in Israel Might Stay in Power,2023-11-16,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"Updated at 9:50 a.m. ET on November 27, 2023After Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israel, vigils and demonstrations broke out in Tel Aviv, mourning the dead and demanding the return of the hostages. One popular photo showed a lone woman with a hand-drawn sign that proposed a trade:Bibi for the Hostages. Remarkably few Israelis would, in those early days of the war, have objected. Bibi—Benjamin Netanyahu—was prime minister during the worst sneak-attack in the country’s history, and the disgust at his government’s failure was universal. A survey recently found that only 4 percent of Jewish Israelis ranked him as the most reliable of Israeli public figures. His overall approval rating recently clocked in at 27 percent, which for a wartime leader is desperately low, comparable to what a politician gets when (as Selina Meyer put it inVeep) “running on a platform of higher taxes and episiotomies.”So why is Netanyahu still in office—and why do I keep meeting people who think he’ll still be there for a long time to come? Even Israelis who despise him, and would give him to Hamas gratis, acknowledge that it would be senseless for him to step down in the middle of a war. Once it’s over, he’ll have his political reckoning—and although I suspect he will no longer be prime minister in a year’s time, betting against Netanyahu’s survival is like betting against the house. He might be too shameless to step down, and too entrenched to be forced into retirement. The problem, in short, is that there might be no one who both stands ready to replace Netanyahu and can command the confidence of enough Israelis to form a government."
Elon Musk’s Disturbing ‘Truth’,2023-11-16,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter.Sign up for it here.The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society “likes to bring invaders in that kill our people … Screw your optics, I’m going in.” Those were the last wordsposted onlineby Robert Bowers before he massacred worshippers at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue in 2018. It was the single deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history. In previous postings, Bowers explained the grievances that led him to commit mass murder. He sharedmemeaftermemeasserting that Jews were conspiring to flood the country with brown people in order to oppose and displace the white race. “Open you Eyes!”declared one. “It’s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!”On Wednesday night, the world’s wealthiest man affirmed this same conspiracy theory on X, formerly Twitter, the social-media site he owns. Like so many of Elon Musk’s acts of self-immolation, it happened in the space of a tweet. The incident began with a post from a conservative Jewish user who complained about anti-Semitic content on social media during the current Gaza conflict. “To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting ‘Hitler was right,’” he wrote. “You got something you want to say? Why dont you say it to our faces.” A small-time white-nationalist account soon responded by attributing this anti-Semitism to minorities, and blaming it on the Jews:"
"After 30 Years in Israel, I See My Country Differently",2023-07-28,TheAtlantic,['Matti Friedman'],"Israel in the past six months has felt like a madhouse, a political protest the size of New Jersey, an unending traffic jam, a lab for bad ideas, a glimpse of the future of Western democracy in the social-media age. It has also been a classroom, even for those of us who think we’re experts. I’ve lived and written here for nearly 30 years. But as I stood among thousands of other protesters outside the Knesset on Monday, the midday heat so strong that I almost longed for relief from the police water cannon, I realized that I was learning to see the country with new eyes.Inside the Knesset, the most extreme government in Israel’s history was legislating the first stage of its plan to move power from the courts and into its own hands, changing the rules of the democratic game. The law passed. The protest couldn’t stop it. One opposition lawmakerdescribedit as the hardest day of his life, and he used to be the No. 2 man in the Mossad. Like many people here, I’ve been at a demonstration almost every week since the beginning of the year. This one had the same chanting and flag-waving, but it seemed desperate, with an undercurrent less of defiance than of fear. A chapter in Israeli history was ending. We don’t know what comes next."
Stop Saying 'Smart Cities',2018-02-12,TheAtlantic,['Bruce Sterling'],"The term “smart city” is interesting yet not important, because nobody defines it. “Smart” is a snazzy political label used by a modern alliance of leftist urbanites and tech industrialists. To deem yourself “smart” is to make theNIMBYites and market-force people look stupid.Smart-city devotees all over this world will agree that London is particularly smart. Why? London is a huge, ungainly beast whose cartwheeling urban life is in cranky, irrational disarray. London is a god-awful urban mess, but London does have some of the best international smart-city conferences.London also has a large urban-management bureaucracy who emit the proper smart-city buzzwords and have even invented some themselves.  The language of Smart City is always Global Business English, no matter what town you're in.So if grand old London is smart, with its empty skyscrapers, creepy CCTV videocams, and sewers plugged with animal fat, then we probably needn’t fret about the Elon Musk sequins and stardust of digital urbanism. Better to reimagine the forthcoming urban future as a mirror of Rome, that “Eternal City,” where nothing much ever gets tech-fixed, but everything changes constantly so that everything can remain the same.Rome and London are two huge, sluggish beasts of cities that have outlived millennia of eager reformers. They share a world where half the people already live in cities and another couple billion are on their way into town. The population is aging quickly, the current infrastructure must crumble and be replaced by its very nature, and climate disaster is taking the place of the past’s great urban fires, wars, and epidemics. Those are the truly important, dull but worthy urban issues."
"Think Strategy, Not Tactics",2023-11-01,TheAtlantic,['Eliot A. Cohen'],"Too much of the commentary on the war in Gaza begins with tactics, which are concerned with achieving small, concrete military objectives, such as taking a hill or launching an ambush. Tactics and operations (the combination of a number of tactical engagements) in turn support strategy, the matching of military and other means to political objectives. It is with strategy that an understanding of this conflict should begin. War is horrifying. But if we wish to understand its likely course, we should not start by focusing on the grimness of urban warfare, the particular hellishness of battles in tunnels, or the difficulties of separating civilians and combatants in an urban setting. Instead, we must ask how both sides conceive their objectives and the broadest ways in which they intend to use force to achieve them.Both sides are driven by total objectives. For Hamas, this is nothing new: In its 1988 covenant, it committed itself to the annihilation of the state of Israel, and then and since, to the extermination of as many of its citizens as possible. Like most extreme Islamist movements, it distinguishes only loosely, or not at all, between Jews and Israelis. This objective justifies in its view the ultimate in violence, all of which was horrifically on display in the October 7 massacre, accompanied by the murder of children, rape, torture, beheading, and kidnapping. Behind its strategy is a long-term theory of victory: that such attacks, coupled perhaps with strikes by Hezbollah and Iran, or the risings of Palestinians in the West Bank, will cause Israel to collapse. In Hamas’s view, Israeli counterattacks on Gaza, which will inevitably kill many civilians, contribute to its objectives because they undermine support for Israel abroad, and inflame its many enemies."
Grieving Parents Are Turning to Posthumous IVF,2019-02-26,TheAtlantic,"['Shira Rubin, Undark']","More than four years ago, Liat Malka waited anxiously for a sperm sample from a deceased man she had never met to fertilize her solitary egg in a hospital petri dish. The Israeli kindergarten teacher hoped to undergo in vitro fertilization and was disappointed when, in the first attempt, her egg and the donor sperm failed to create a viable embryo. The next month, though, brought success. Malka had the embryo transferred into her uterus and nine months later gave birth to Shira, whose name was chosen because it means both “song” and “prayer” in Hebrew.Sometimes, Shira looks at a picture of her father. In a two-bedroom apartment in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon that she shares with her mother and grandmother, Shira has grown up seeing this man smiling back at her with a wide grin and kind, bespectacled eyes. When she was younger, she called him by his first name, Baruch. Recently, Malka has been trying to get her to call him Daddy. “Look how nicely he smiles. That’s Daddy,” says Malka, gently, as they stand in front of the photo."
Yemen Is Not a Sideshow,2018-06-12,TheAtlantic,['Barbara A. Leaf'],"After three years of a grinding, bloody stalemate, the war in Yemen may be reaching an inflection point. Hoping to deliver a knockout blow, the joint United Arab Emirates’ and Yemeni forces are moving up the Red Sea coast towards the port city ofHodeidah. The UAE aims to wrest it from the Houthi rebels, and, in so doing, deprive them of vital revenues, strike a psychological blow, and pressure them to the negotiating table.Yet even if Hodeidah falls, there is no end in sight for this conflict, whose third anniversary was eclipsed by a recent, splashy visit to the United States from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The ambitious young royal launched the war in March 2015 along with the UAE and several other nations to restore the legitimate government of Yemen. Backed by limited U.S. military support, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi sought to disrupt Iran’s nascent efforts to turn the Houthis into a proxy force, and to contain the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.If the Obama administration was never enthusiastic about the Saudi-Emirati enterprise in Yemen, it showed sustained interest in bringing the conflict to an end via a political process, and lent direct U.S. leadership to the effort in its final year. The Trump administration entered office with a stated commitment to knitting up frayed relations with the Gulf and focusing on Iran’s destabilizing activities across the region. Yet ironically, that never translated into a senior-level focus on Yemen, where those strands come tightly together. In fact, U.S. support for the coalition’s campaign has largely been on auto-pilot, when what its Gulf partners needed most over the past 18 months was a sustained diplomatic effort to enable a credible negotiated settlement."
The Inflection Point,2023-10-20,TheAtlantic,['Peter Wehner'],"The significance of President Joe Biden’s Oval Office address to the nation last night was signaled in the opening sentence: “We’re facing an inflection point in history.”What followed was a speech that may well define Biden’s presidency.The proximate cause for the speech was Biden’s desire to urge Americans to stand with Israel in its war against Hamas and Ukraine in its war against Russia. The president is expected to ask Congress for emergency assistance for the two nations in a $100 billion spending package. But the speech was not primarily about money; it was about America’s teleology, about how Biden sees the role of the United States in a world that is fraying and aflame.Biden used phrases loaded with meaning. America is “the arsenal of democracy,” he said, invoking a phrase from a 1940 speech by Franklin D. Roosevelt. But in case that wasn’t clear enough, Biden said America is “the essential nation” and the “indispensable nation.” It “holds the world together,” Biden said. Israel and Ukraine are 1,200 miles apart. The conflicts are quite different; Ukraine is battling a world power, and Israel a terrorist organization. But Biden twinned the two conflicts, presenting the outcome of these wars as vital to America’s national security."
Trump Will Abandon NATO,2023-12-04,TheAtlantic,['Anne Applebaum'],"“Idon’t givea shit about NATO.” Thus did former President Donald Trump onceexpress his feelingsabout America’s oldest and strongest military alliance. Not that this statement, made in the presence of John Bolton, the national security adviser at the time, came as a surprise. Long before he was a political candidate, Trumpquestioned the value of American alliances. Of Europeans,he once wrotethat “their conflicts are not worth American lives. Pulling back from Europe would save this country millions of dollars annually.” NATO, founded in 1949 and supported for three-quarters of a century by Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike, has long beena particular focus of Trump’s ire. As president, Trump threatened to withdraw from NATO many times—including, infamously, at the 2018 NATO summit.But during Trump’s time in office, the withdrawal never happened. That was because someone was always there to talk him out of it. Bolton says he did; Jim Mattis, John Kelly, Rex Tillerson, Mike Pompeo, and even Mike Pence are thought to have done so too.But they didn’t change his mind. And if Trump is reelected in 2024, none of those people will be in the White House. All of them have broken with the former president,in some cases dramatically, and there isn’t another pool of Republican analysts who understand Russia and Europe, because most of them eithersigned statements opposing him in 2016or criticized him after 2020. In a second term, Trump would be surrounded by people who either share his dislike of American security alliances or don’t know anything about them and don’t care. This time, the ill will that Trumphas always felt toward American allieswould likely manifest itself in a clear policy change. “The damage he did in his first term was reparable,” Bolton told me. “The damage in the second term would be irreparable.”Institutionally, and maybe even politically, leaving NATO could be difficult for Trump. As soon as he announced his intentions, a constitutional crisis would ensue. Senate approval is required for U.S. treaties—but the Constitution says nothing about congressional approval for withdrawal from treaties. Recognizing this gap in the law, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and Republican Senator Marco Rubio introduced legislation, which has already passed the Senate, designed toblock any U.S. president from withdrawing from NATOwithout two-thirds Senate approval or an act of Congress. Kaine told me he feels “confident that the courts would uphold us on that and would not allow a president to unilaterally withdraw,” but there would certainly be a struggle. A public-relations crisis would unfold too. A wide range of people—former supreme allied commanders, former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, former presidents, foreign heads of state—will surely rally to make the case for NATO, and very loudly."
Study-Abroad Programs Enter the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,2018-10-12,TheAtlantic,['Gabby Deutch'],"Twice this semester, University of Michigan instructors have made headlines for their opposition to Israel. In September, John Cheney-Lippold, an associate professor in the university’s American-culture department, took back his offer to write a student a letter of recommendation after learning she planned to study in Tel Aviv. On Tuesday, a nearly identical story emerged.The Washington Postreportedthat Lucy Peterson, a graduate student in political theory, had told an undergraduate she’d be “delighted” to write him a recommendation letter to study abroad. Then she learned he wanted to study in Tel Aviv, and she rescinded her offer.Both instructors cited a boycott of Israel as their reason. And both promised that they’d be happy to write these students recommendations to study in other countries. They probably thought they were taking a moral, even righteous, stand. But by singling Israel out, these instructors have impeded their students’ ability to gain a nuanced understanding of a complicated conflict—and have betrayed their responsibility to foster serious intellectual engagement."
Lauren Groff Has Written a New Gospel,2023-09-12,TheAtlantic,['Judith Shulevitz'],"At some point during the winterof 1609–10, in Jamestown, Virginia, the starving English settlers are said to have begun eating one another. Meanwhile, back in London, the King James Version of the Bible, arguably the greatest work of prose in the English language, was receiving its final edits; it went to the printer the following year. Lauren Groff’s haunting new novel,The Vaster Wilds, doesn’t mention the King James Bible by name, or that its completion coincided with the horrors at Jamestown. But the confluence of these two events hovers in the background. The novel is set in and around the colony just before and during the Starving Time, as it came to be known, with flashbacks to London—and it has a biblical dimension of its own. The same two extremes of human experience are on display: both high spiritual striving and colonialism in all of its unhinged depravity. Think of the book as Groff’s marriage of heaven and hell.The spiritual seeker is the protagonist of the novel, a character Groff refers to as “the girl.” She is an orphan with mysteriously dark skin: Her father, who is unknown, may have had Moorish blood. When the story opens, the girl has just snuck out of the Jamestown fort—the inhabitants have descended into cannibalism—and run away from her employers. These are a minister and his wife, who took her, their servant, with them from London to the colonies after the man decided, seemingly on a whim, to seek his fortunes in the New World. The narrative recounts the girl’s journey through the wilderness."
The Unlikely World Leader Who Just Dispelled Musk’s Utopian AI Dreams,2023-09-22,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"On Sunday, just before heading to the United Nations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Elon Musk in San Francisco. Their livestreamed rendezvous held obvious appeal for both men. Theembattled Netanyahuwould get to show his voters that he could command the attention of the world’s richest man. Musk would get to show the world that he had a Jewish friend, days aftergetting caught upin an anti-Semitism scandal on his social-media platform. The meeting was, essentially, a glorified photo op.That’s how it started, at least.At the outset, Netanyahu called Musk the “Edison of our time.” Musk returned the favor by not challenging Netanyahu’s insistence that his proposed judicial reforms—which have provoked thelargest protest movementin Israel’s history—would make the country a “stronger democracy.” (“Sounds good,” the mogul replied.) The two men discussed their shared love of books and then, after about 40 minutes, wrapped up their exchange, at which point most people tuned out. But that’s precisely when things got interesting."
A Speaker Without Enemies—For Now,2023-10-25,TheAtlantic,['Russell Berman'],"When Representative Mike Johnson arrived in Congress in 2017, he received an important piece of advice from a fellow Louisianan, Representative Steve Scalise. “Be careful about your early alliances that you make,” Scalise told Johnson, as the younger Republicanrecalledin a C-SPAN interview that year. Avoid getting “marginalized or labeled in any way.”Six years later, Johnson has followed that advice all the way to the House speakership, reaching a post that is second in line to the presidency faster than any other lawmaker in modern congressional history. Staunchly conservative and closely aligned with former President Donald Trump, the 51-year-old former talk-radio host made few headlines and fewer enemies as he climbed the ranks of his party.With a 220–209 House vote this afternoon, Johnson was able to forge a consensus that eluded three previous aspirants—including his own mentor, Scalise—to replace Kevin McCarthy. He earned unanimous support from Republican members, who stood and applauded when he clinched a majority of the chamber. His victory ends a weeks-long power struggle that immobilized the House as a war started in the Middle East and a government shutdown loomed."
Why Israel Fears Iran’s Presence in Syria,2018-07-22,TheAtlantic,['David Kenner'],"In some ways, Israel has never been more powerful. It boasts a close relationship with the Trump administration, a powerful and nuclear-armed military, and an air force capable of striking enemies hundreds of miles away. At the same time, it is a small country with limited infrastructure: It has one international airport, a handful of major power stations, and an electrical grid that Israeli experts havealready warnedis vulnerable to attack.Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, have obtained advanced missiles that are designed to exploit those weaknesses. For Israeli security officials, the nightmare scenario is that these weapons may become accurate enough to hit Israel’s civilian and military infrastructure, paralyzing daily life in the country. The threat they pose has already drawn Israel deeper into the Syrian conflict, and promises to fundamentally alter the next war with Hezbollah—a war that could come sooner than expected.Since the beginning of the Syrian war, Israeli warplanes have struck Hezbollah arms convoys more than 100 times. A Syrian government offensive is sweeping through the southwest of the country, threatening to spark a further escalation. Syrian regime forcesare approachingIsrael, which hassent reinforcementsto its side of the border to contain any spillover violence. Recently, Israelshot downtwo Syrian military drones that crossed into Israeli territory. While Iranian-backed fighters have played a low-profile role in the offensive, officials in Jerusalem remain worried that they could quietly move in once the Syrian government regains control."
Israel on the Brink,2023-07-25,TheAtlantic,['Natan Sachs'],"The Knesset’s passage of legislation yesterday to curtail the authority of Israel’s Supreme Court marks a new era for the state of Israel. The disjuncture comes not because of the legal implications alone, although they are substantial. Nor because of the economic, diplomatic, and security damage wrought in the short time since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to office, although it is considerable. Rather, the new era begins because of the damage that proceeding with the bill has done to Israeli society itself.In March, the governing coalition led by Netanyahu paused in its effort to overhaul judicial review. Instead, it turned to administrative review—the Court’s authority to overturn actions taken by the executive branch—limiting the ability of the Court to set aside acts it deems “unreasonable.”The reasonableness doctrine, as Amichai Cohen and Yuval Shani of the Israel Democracy Institute explained inLawfare, provided grounds for striking down a decision where the Court found a conflict of interest, a procedural impropriety, or an act that exceeded the government’s legal authority. The Court could also rule on substantive grounds, finding that the government had acted in a discriminatory manner, taken into account irrelevant considerations, or adopted “patently unreasonable” decisions."
Corbynism Can’t Happen Here,2019-12-13,TheAtlantic,['Franklin Foer'],"Even though the polls always suggested the likelihood of Jeremy Corbyn’s defeat in yesterday’s British elections, his continued presence as the head of the Labour Party filled me with a great sense of foreboding. The local press excavated from Corbyn’s not-so-distant past videos that revealed him to be, at best, indifferent to anti-Semitism: as hevouchedfor the moral character of an imam who had accused Jews of drinking the blood of children; as hechampioneda mural artist who’d painted a cabal of hook-nosed bankers; as heaccusedZionists of lacking “English irony.” When confronted with these statements—there are plentymore—he tended to express irritation rather than contrition.A venerable political party that poses as the enemy of racism was suddenly and demonstrablyrifewith it. From the other side of the Atlantic, it was hard not to entertain the anxiety that something similar might plausibly happen here, and soon: In the leftward shift of the Democratic Party, a strain of Corbynism might implant itself.As I have turned over this worry—the fear that the populist left might replicate the sins of the populist right—my concerns have usually been allayed by the fact that the American version of Jeremy Corbyn is Bernie Sanders. The two resurgent relics of the ’70s left have ascended in tandem—and their ascents have exposed subtle (but crucial) moral and ideological distinctions."
The Lessons Israel Should Have Learned in Lebanon,2023-11-07,TheAtlantic,['Andrew Exum'],"We are a month into Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza. The ferocity of Israel’s response to the murder of more than 1,400 Israeli citizens has been such that international concern for the Palestinians of Gaza—half of whom, or more than 1 million, are children under the age of 15—has now largely eclipsed any sympathy that might have been felt for the victims of the crimes that precipitated the war in the first place.Israel has a right to defend itself, and it has a right to seek to destroy, or at least severely degrade, the primary perpetrator of the attacks of October 7, Hamas. I am unconvinced, however, that Israel’s strategy is sound. Specifically, I am worried that Israel has staked out maximalist objectives, not for the first time, and will, as it did in 2006 against Hezbollah in Lebanon, fall far short of those objectives, allowing the enemy to claim a victory—a Pyrrhic victory, to be sure, but a victory nonetheless.I spent a lot of time with the Israel Defense Forces while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy for two years. But much earlier in my life, I had gone to graduate school in Lebanon, then moved back there in an attempt to better understand how Hezbollah had evolved into Israel’s most capable foe. My research revealed as much about Israeli missteps and weaknesses as it did about Hezbollah’s strengths."
A Muslim Among Israeli Settlers,2018-05-10,TheAtlantic,['Wajahat Ali'],"Image above: A Palestinian worker in Shiloh tends to the grounds of what some Jews believe was the first capital of the Israelite kingdom.Iwas here to report on Jewish settlers,the 600,000 citizens of Israel living beyond its pre-1967 borders. My main concern was whether the normally guarded and cautious settler community would open up and talk to me: a brown-skinned, practicing Muslim from the United States."

Understanding Hamas’s Genocidal Ideology,2023-10-10,TheAtlantic,['Bruce Hoffman'],"This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read fromThe Atlantic, Monday through Friday.Sign up for it here.— William L. Shirer,The Rise and Fall of the Third ReichHow many Israelis, or Jews, or anyone else for that matter, have read the 1988 Hamas Covenant or the revised charter that was issued in 2017? With 36 articles of only a few paragraphs’ length each in the former, and 42 concise statements of general principles and objectives in the latter, both are considerably shorter and more digestible than the 782-page original German-language edition ofMein Kampf. Moreover, unlike Hitler’s seminal work, which was not published in English until March 1939, excellent English translations of both the original Hamas Covenant and its successor can easily be found on the internet."
The Anger in Jordan's Streets,2017-07-28,TheAtlantic,['Alice Su'],"Updated on August 2, 2017AMMAN, Jordan—The family of Mohammad Jawawdeh, the 16-year-old Jordanian who was killed by an Israeli embassy guard on Sunday night, lives on the southern outskirts of Amman, near a large concrete lot. On Monday, the family had already set up a mourning tent there for the relatives and neighbors who came to grieve the teenager’s death. They arranged rows of chairs and carpets for praying, printed photos of their lost son with the words “Martyr of the Embassy” underneath, and served dates and cold water to everyone who came.That tent was still standing on Thursday, after the teenager’s funeral and three-day wake were attended by hundreds of Jordanians, journalists, and King Abdullah II himself, but with one difference: Someone had painted a large Israeli flag on the floor—so that everyone coming to visit would step on it—with the words “Death to Israel” underneath.Last Sunday afternoon, Jawawdeh’s father had sent him to install some furniture in an apartment near the Israeli embassy. A dispute broke out between the teenager and an Israeli guard, during which Jawawdeh attacked the Israeli with a screwdriver, according to Israeli and Jordanian authorities. The guard shot and killed the boy in response. He also shot Bashar Hamarneh, the apartment’s landlord, an orthopedic surgeon in his 50s who happened to be present. Hamarneh died in a hospital, while a third witness, the furniture truck driver, was said to be severely wounded and in intensive care, though his wife later revealed that he was unharmed and being questioned in police custody."
Why My Father Made Me Forget Our Palestinian Catastrophe,2018-05-15,TheAtlantic,['Seraj Assi'],"When the creation of the State of Israel 70 years ago led to a mass Palestinian exodus, only about 150,000 Palestiniansout of nearly 1 million who had lived on the territorymanaged to remain within the new state. Among them were my grandparents. And yet, it wasn’t until I was 20 years old that I first heard of thenakba, an Arabic term meaning “catastrophe” that many Palestinians use to mark the events of 1948.Ironically, I heard the word from a Jewish friend at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In my excitement, I called my father and told him about my thrilling new discovery. He faltered, then advised me to get thisnakbaout of my system.I hung up and stood there dumbly, wondering at the way my father seemed to be shunning the truth of his own existence. For 20 years, he had managed to silence, suppress, and obliterate the mention of the very word that binds Palestinians together in a shared memory.But I could hardly blame him. Between 1948 and 1966, men like my father and grandfather were forced to live under a military regime imposed by Israel on its remaining Arab population. Their freedom of movement was controlled by Israeli permit requirements and curfews. They were restricted from seeing their fellow Palestinians and Arabs in neighboring countries like Jordan and Egypt, in the West Bank and Gaza, and even in other towns and villages inside Israel. Haunted by the fresh memory of loss and displacement, the first generation of Arabs in Israel was born into national limbo. Virtually overnight, they became strangers in their own homeland."
Why Attacks on Jewish Cemeteries Provoke Particular Fear,2017-02-27,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"Tarek El-Messidi had been planning to leave Philadelphia to visit family on Sunday night. But when he heard that Mount Carmel Jewish Cemetery had been desecrated, he cancelled his flight. El-Messidi is Muslim, but he felt it was important to be with his hometown Jewish community at that moment, he said. “Both communities in America are being targeted right now. There’s a rise in Islamophobia and anti-Semitism,” he said. “That could have just as easily been a Muslim cemetery.”Just one week after a Jewish cemetery in Missouri was vandalized, Philadelphia police reported that roughly 100 headstones have been toppled or damaged in the Mount Carmel cemetery. These are not easy monuments to knock down, El-Messidi said: He saw several toppled stones that were three or four feet wide at the base. El-Messidi and the local rabbis who showed up on Sunday night said their group observed far more extensive damage than police reported, with more than 500 headstones affected throughout the cemetery. It’s not clear when that damage happened, though, or whether it was all intentional.Like El-Messidi, Philadelphia Jewish leaders have been quick to condemn the vandalism as an act of targeted anti-Semitism. “After you start walking from row to row,” said Shawn Zevit, the lead rabbi at Mishkan Shalom, a local Reconstructionist synagogue, “it quickly moves from a random act of vandalism to something with larger intentions and a systematic approach to things.”Proving those “larger intentions” of anti-Semitism may be harder than it seems. While the timing of the two acts of vandalism may seem deliberate and discriminatory, religiously motivated hate crimes are notoriously difficult to prove. What’s clear is that people are scared, and they see the destruction of cemeteries as an implicit threat. On Monday, 13 Jewish Community Centers around the country received bomb threats, according to a spokesperson, the most recent wave of threats since January. Muslims’ and Jews’ strong reactions to the cemetery vandalism underscores the heightened sense of discrimination both groups feel right now. As each community continues dealing with attacks like this, they may feel drawn to act together more frequently—in part because they’re operating in similar environments of religious hatred."
The Best of Bad Options for Recovering the Hostages,2023-10-17,TheAtlantic,['Dennis Ross'],"Atruism ofnational security is that leaders constantly face a dilemma in which neither choice is good. In wartime especially, that choice can be excruciating. Today, Israel’s leaders confront just such a challenge: hostages.Hamas has imposed a war on Israel, one set in motion by the gruesome atrocities committed by the Gaza-based Islamist group. In the October 7 attack, Hamas terrorists murdered more than 1,300 Israelis in their homes, at their workplaces, and at a music festival, riddling babies with bullets and mutilating the bodies of others; they took scores of survivors back to Gaza as hostages.Amid the horror and carnage, those hostages must not be overlooked or forgotten. Israel’s ethos has always been shaped by a sense that its enemies—seeking the Jewish state’s destruction—must understand that for any cost they might impose, they will pay 50-fold. But another part of that ethos insists that no Israeli is abandoned."
Why Does America Support Israel?,2022-07-14,TheAtlantic,[],
Forget the Bomb and Help Iranians Fight Their Regime,2023-10-21,TheAtlantic,"['Reuel Marc Gerecht, Ray Takeyh']","Just three weeks before Hamas’s gruesome attack on southern Israel, the first anniversary of Iran’s “Women, life, freedom” movement quietly passed on September 16. Even in the heat of events in Israel, the women’s uprising was worth a lament: If the theocracy hadn’t subdued it, Iranians might have toppled the Islamic Republic; and among all the other salutary effects, Hamas’s onslaught against Israel could conceivably have been smaller and less ambitious, or might not have happened at all.Hamas, an offshoot of the Sunni Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, is an independent actor but has ties to the Islamic Republic that have grown substantially over the years. Its political head, Ismail Haniyeh, has often visited Tehran and Beirut, where other Hamas officials are in regular contact with the Lebanese Hezbollah, Iran’s most powerful, operationally savvy proxy. As Iranians in ever larger numbers have rejected the Islamic Revolution and its theocracy, the clerical regime has sought affirmation and legitimacy abroad—an aggressive disposition that isn’t likely to abate until Iranian dissent finally triumphs.Officially, the Iranian regime characterizes internal protests as foreign-inspired, but most of its insiders actually know that the Islamic Republic’s worst problems are homegrown. They are mournfully aware that Iranians have deeply absorbed secular and democratic values. But despite its frequent expressions, that popular discontent has not yet become a revolutionary challenge to the ruling elite."
Substack Has a Nazi Problem,2023-11-28,TheAtlantic,['Jonathan M. Katz'],"The newsletter-hostingsite Substack advertises itself as the last, best hope for civility on the internet—and aspires to abigger role in politicsin 2024. But just beneath the surface, the platform has become a home and propagator of white supremacy and anti-Semitism. Substack has not only been hosting writers who post overtly Nazi rhetoric on the platform; it profits from many of them.Substack, founded in 2017, hasterms of servicethat formally proscribe “hate,” along with pornography, spam, and anyone “restricted from making money on Substack”—a category that includes businesses banned by Stripe, the platform’s default payment processor. But Substack’s leaders also proudly disdain the content-moderation methods that other platforms employ, albeit with spotty results, to limit the spread of racist or bigoted speech. An informal search of the Substack website and of extremist Telegram channels that circulate Substack posts turns up scores of white-supremacist, neo-Confederate, and explicitly Nazi newsletters on Substack—many of them apparently started in the past year. These are, to be sure, a tiny fraction of the newsletters on a site that hadmore than 17,000 paid writersas of March, according toAxios, and has many other writers who do not charge for their work. But to overlook white-nationalist newsletters on Substack as marginal or harmless would be a mistake.At least 16 of the newsletters that I reviewed have overt Nazi symbols, including the swastika and thesonnenrad, in their logos or in prominent graphics. Andkon’s Reich Press, for example, calls itself “a National Socialist newsletter”; its logo shows Nazi banners on Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, and one recent post features a racist caricature of a Chinese person. A Substack called White-Papers, bearing the tagline “Your pro-White policy destination,” is one of several that openly promote the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory that inspired deadly mass shootings at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, synagogue; two Christchurch, New Zealand, mosques; an El Paso, Texas, Walmart; and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Other newsletters make prominent references to the “Jewish Question.” Several are run by nationally prominent white nationalists; at least four are run by organizers of the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia—including the rally’s most notorious organizer, Richard Spencer."
The Ryanair Hijacking Pierced the Delusion of Flight,2021-05-28,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"On Sunday, Ryanair Flight4978 was traveling over Belarussian airspace from Athens to Vilnius when Minsk air-traffic control delivered alarming news. “You have bomb on board,” the controllersaid. “We recommend you to land.” A Belarussian MiG fighter jet showed up on Ryanair’s wing to emphasize the recommendation. Minutes later, the Ryanair plane landed, and Belarussian authorities arrested two passengers: Roman Protasevich, a Belarussian dissident, and his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. The rest continued on to Vilnius, except for a handful who preferred to stay in Minsk, possibly to sightsee, possibly because they were Belarussian operatives planted on the flight to supervise the arrest.Ryanair’s CEOcalledthe incident “state-sponsored hijacking.” It was not.Technically, you have to be on a plane to hijack it. But the Ryanair incident was nevertheless diabolical—and what makes it particularly diabolical is that Belarus may have managed to pull it off without violating its agreements under international law."
Even a ‘Diplomat’s Diplomat’ Can’t Solve Syria’s Civil War,2018-11-26,TheAtlantic,['David Kenner'],"BEIRUT—If the only thing you knew about Syria came from the United Nations Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura’sbriefingto the Security Council this month, you might assume that dramatic events were afoot. An important meeting had taken place in Istanbul, he said, while equally vital summits in Astana, Kazakhstan, and of the G-20 countries in Buenos Aires were in the offing. The work under way was “absolutely urgent,” he told the council, and the coming weeks “will be of crucial importance.”Outside of such briefings, however, there is no suspense about the outcome of the Syrian war. President Bashar al-Assad, with the help of his Russian and Iranian allies, has used brute force to pacify the majority of the country. Half of the Syrian population has fled their homes, and the violence has reached such a fever pitch that the United Nations has lost count of the number of lives claimed by the war. The prospects for de Mistura’s peace plan are nonexistent—Assad is not about to relinquish his hard-won battlefield gains at the negotiating table.The Swedish Italian diplomat’s tenure is emblematic of the international community’s struggles to grapple with Syria. His term provides a window into the forces that have made the conflict so resistant to diplomacy, and has served as a launching point for a debate among analysts and would-be peacemakers about diplomats’ roles in resolving the world’s worst crises."
Read Trump's Speech Withdrawing From the Iran Deal,2018-05-08,TheAtlantic,['Lena Felton'],"On Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions on the country. The agreement—which was reached by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany, along with the European Union, in July 2015—lifted sanctions on Iran in return for the country halting its nuclear program. Trump has long been vocal in his opposition to the deal, calling it a “horrible agreement,” an “embarrassment,” and, a day before his announcement, “very badly negotiated.” Trump’s decision to reinstate sanctions on Iran puts the U.S. at odds with its allies, who have indicated that they plan to stay in the deal.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani recentlysaidthat if the U.S. exits the deal, “it will quickly see that this decision will be a regret of historic proportions.” However,the debateas to the best course of action is a heated one: Some argue that the dealisn’t effective, while others say that withdrawingrisks provoking an unnecessary crisis.Here, a full transcript of Trump’s remarks."
Why an Effort to Thwart Some Boycotts of Israel Fails the Free-Speech Test,2017-07-25,TheAtlantic,['Conor Friedersdorf'],"Like disputes over abortion, the death penalty, and drug prohibition, the conflict between Israel and Palestine divides Americans into polarized camps of mutual distrust. If any consensus is possible on those issues, it is that there is nothing like a consensus, and that the attendant conflict is better handled through politics than violence.Yet dozens of members of Congress have backedconfusingly worded legislationthat would impose new restrictions on American citizens who want to participate in boycotts against Israel, if they originate with an international organization like the UN or the EU. The bill thus seems to risk excluding some would-be boycotters from normal politics by criminalizing some expressions of dissent as a serious felony.One needn’t favor “Boycott, Divest, Sanctions,” the most prominent boycott campaign targeting Israel, to believe that criminalizing boycotts is deeply illiberal.Say that BDS is the best path to securing equitable peace in the Middle East. Or say that targeting Israel for a boycott, alone among countries that abuse human rights, is inconsistent, wrongheaded, and unlikely to help Palestinians. The merits don’t matter here. Americans have a right to adopt even mistaken positions, to engage in even ill-advised activism, and to stop dealing with even laudable entities."
Inside Biden’s ‘Hug Bibi’ Strategy,2023-10-17,TheAtlantic,['Franklin Foer'],"With his trip to Israel tomorrow, Joe Biden will become the second American president to travel abroad to an active war zone that is not controlled by his own military. The first was also Joe Biden. When he ventured to Kyiv last February, he arrived during a lull in the fighting. This time, he’s flying into an escalating conflict. He will be, however briefly, the equivalent of a human shield, a temporary deterrent against a potential fusillade of Hezbollah rockets, because striking an American president is a risk that Iran’s proxy army in Lebanon will surely want to avoid.Biden’s visit isn’t simply a dramatic gesture of solidarity born of hisdeeply felt Zionism. It is a strategic mission, an expression of his highly psychological approach to foreign policy—and of the insights into the Israeli psyche he’s gleaned through his many visits to the country and from his long relationship with that nation’s political elite.A recent precedent captures his thinking. In May 2021, Hamas began firing rockets on Israeli cities. Biden told aides that he wanted to scrap the traditional playbook for navigating such a conflagration. Rather than dispatching his secretary of state to the region or calling for a cease-fire, he said that he wanted to smother Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—known as Bibi—with friendship. Or, as one White House aide described it to me, Biden wanted to “hug Bibi tight.”"
America’s Most Popular Drug Has a Puzzling Side Effect. We Finally Know Why.,2023-06-27,TheAtlantic,['Sarah Zhang'],"Statins, one of the most extensively studied drugs on the planet,taken by tens of millions of Americansalone, have long had a perplexing side effect. Many patients—some 5 percent in clinical trials, and up to 30 percent in observational studies—experience sore and achy muscles, especially in the upper arms and legs. A much smaller proportion, less than 1 percent, develop muscle weakness or myopathy severe enough that they find it hard to “climb stairs, get up from a sofa, get up from the toilet,” says Robert Rosenson, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai. He’s had patients fall on the street because they couldn’t lift their leg over a curb.But why should an anticholesterol drug weaken muscles in the arms and legs? Recently, two groups of scientists stumbled upon an answer. They didn’t set out to study statins. They weren’t studying cholesterol at all. They were hunting for genes behind a rare disease called limb girdle muscle dystrophy, in which muscles of the upper arms and legs—sound familiar?—become weak and waste away. After both teams tracked the disease through ahandful of families in the U.S.anda Bedouin family in Israel, their suspicions separately landed on mutations in a gene encoding a particularly intriguing enzyme."
Yitzhak Rabin and the Case for Courage,2020-11-04,TheAtlantic,['Bill Clinton'],"Late at night on November 4, 1995, while leaving a huge rally in Tel Aviv, moments after leading the crowd in singing the “Song of Peace”—“Don’t say the day will come; bring the day!”—Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was shot by a young Israeli bitterly opposed to the peace process with the Palestinians.Although Rabin and I worked together for less than three years, we built a close working relationship and a deep friendship. Yitzhak possessed a rare combination of gifts that made him remarkable, and well suited for the moment. He was a brave soldier, principled patriot, skilled strategist, and keen judge of character who understood how people thought and felt, and why they did what they did. He grew into a masterful political leader able to navigate diplomatic negotiations and domestic politics, including an extremist opposition wing that slandered and attempted to delegitimize him.Rabin lived the history of Israel. He was a military hero who fought for his country in 1948 and 1967. He then became, as he put it in his 1994 speech to Congress, “a soldier in the army of peace,” recognizing that Israel’s fundamental values and interests—freedom, tolerance, security, and democracy—could be preserved and advanced only if it shared the future with its neighbors. He sought a victory that could be won only on the battlefield of the human heart."
What’s Next in Gaza,2023-10-19,TheAtlantic,['Hanna Rosin'],"Just as there are stages of grief, there are stages of war. Not yet two weeks after Hamas’s surprise attack, Israel is still in a raw, early stage. My colleague Graeme Wood, who arrived in Jerusalem this week, described it to me this way: “Israel is still reeling from the trauma of the attack on October 7. That manifests in a number of ways. And one is that there’s a certain amount of Israeli policy that is driven right now by wrath.”Israeli officials insist that they are targeting Hamas, not Gazan citizens. But the situation on the ground for Gazan citizens is dire—a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions, according to the United Nations and other agencies. Wood told me that, among many of the Israelis he’s interviewed, the prevailing attitude is a dangerous if understandable combination of anger, fear, and mourning.The atrocities committed against Israeli citizens on October 7 were especially inhumane. And, as one Israeli I talked with put it, this society’s worst nightmare is vulnerability. What happens when a nation makes crucial wartime decisions while still processing the shock and anger over what it’s experienced?In today’s episode, we discuss the state of Israel with Wood, who frequently reports from the Middle East. I spoke with him shortly after a devastating explosion at a hospital in Gaza, and amid the widespread expectation that Israel will soon send ground troops into Gaza.Listen to the conversation here:The following is a transcript of the episode:[Music]Hanna Rosin:Just as there are stages of grief there are stages of war. And Israel is in an early one.Rosin:Wrath. A combination of anger, fear, mourning and revenge. Which, given the circumstances, seems like a dangerous place to be.This isRadio Atlantic. I’m Hanna Rosin. Today, as war in the Middle East is getting more intense, we look at what happens when a nation makes critical wartime decisions in this state of mind. And how they move from there, to step two, a stage that’s more strategic, more practical, maybe even conciliatory?As President Joe Biden was on his way to visit Israel, I spoke with Graeme Wood, anAtlanticstaff writer who has been reporting in the Middle East in recent months. We reached him in Jerusalem on Tuesday.[Music]Rosin:Graeme, you have landed in Israel. Can you just talk about some of the things that you’ve seen and encountered this week?Wood:Well, I actually landed in Jordan, so the first thing that I noticed was it was difficult to get to Israel. There were so many rockets that were coming out of Gaza that airlines understandably pulled back. So I flew into Jordan, landed there, and then went by land into an Israel that was very different from the one that I left last time I was here, just a month ago.Rosin:And what do you mean, it’s different? What were some of the things that you noticed immediately?Wood:First of all, getting to Jerusalem, which is a city that’s usually filled with pilgrims, filled with tourists. It is eerily quiet in a lot of places that I’ve only known to be absolutely chock-full of people.The other thing that’s really amazing to note compared to a month ago is, a month ago, it seems like ancient history, but we’re talking about convulsions of politics and huge rifts in Israeli society that were playing out in the streets, mostly of Tel Aviv, over the efforts of the government to remake how Israeli politics work. And there’s an unsettling consensus that has replaced that unsettling division, where it went from totally divided to a unity that is really weird to feel in this place. And it happened in the snap of the fingers.Rosin:And what is the mood of that unity?Wood:So there are aspects of rah-rah patriotism. There’s also an ongoing sense of trauma. I mean, the number of people who died, the grisly fashion in which they died—it’s something that every Israeli has been seeing, and has really understood it.I mean, it is so shocking to the conscience, and so close to the lives of so many people here that I think it’s gonna be a while before people have processed this tragedy, this atrocity at that second level.What you do have, though, is a political consensus and a military consensus that I think appeared relatively quickly after October 7, when Hamas broke through the Gaza wall and killed over 1,000 people. And that consensus is that, whatever else is true, Hamas cannot exist.And I haven’t found, I think, almost any Israelis, except for extreme doves, who disagree with that point.And as a corollary to that, they also agree that that requires going into Gaza, and depending on who you ask, rooting out Hamas, killing its leaders, or possibly just leveling the whole place, which is something that I’ve heard a number of Israelis say.Rosin:Okay. So that right there is incredibly complicated, like those distinctions are important. When people say “rooting out Hamas,” what do you hear?Wood:Yeah, so “rooting out Hamas” means rooting out the ruling structures of Gaza. You know, Gaza was abandoned by Israel to the fate of being ruled by Hamas 15-plus years ago. And so getting rid of Hamas means getting rid of the government of this occupied territory. So it’s a huge undertaking. And given how much Hamas has dug in, militarily—Hamas itself says there’s 500 kilometers of tunnels that it controls under the Gaza Strip; those tunnels are filled with weapons; they’re smuggling routes; they may have as many as 200 Israeli hostages in them right now—it’s simply impossible to root out Hamas, whatever that phrase means, without actually going into the Gaza Strip, which Israel has been extremely reluctant to do. And now it’s understood by everybody that, yeah, that’s going to happen, and it’s going to be bloody on both sides.Rosin:By going in, you’re talking about a ground invasion.Wood:That’s what’s expected. Yes. And there’s every indication that Israel is planning to do exactly that. What I think most surprising to most people is that it hasn’t happened yet.Rosin:So far there have been a lot of air strikes and thousands of Gazans killed. What is Israel’s goal in that phase of the attack?Wood:Israel’s goal right now seems to be to do what can be done before the invasion takes place. That is, first, the clearing out of a civilian population from the northern part of the Gaza Strip, specifically Gaza City, which they’ve been calling up people’s cellphones, dropping leaflets. And in both cases, the message is: We’re coming in. And we’re going to kill the leaders of Hamas. We’re going to destroy Hamas.So, what’s already happened is horrible beyond belief, and what’s coming next will probably be worse.Rosin:Always in these situations, there seems to be just this gap between the rhetoric and what happens on the ground. If you tell civilians to flee, where do they actually go?Wood:Yeah. And when I said before that Israel is still reeling from the trauma of the attack of October 7, that manifests in a number of ways. And one is that there’s a certain amount of Israeli policy that is driven right now by wrath.It’s vengeance. It’s an understanding thatwe have to do something.We have to get rid of Hamas.And the phases of that operation, an operation that will almost certainly last months, maybe years. The reckoning of what those phases are going to be is incomplete. And if you ask Israeli officials, “Who’s going to run the Gaza Strip once you’ve gone into it? Are you simply going to be the governing authority there with your boots on the ground forever?”The answer that you get is something like “We don’t know. Don’t ask that question. We’re at the stage right now of just realizing we had to go in against our wishes. We didn’t want to have to go in, but we have to go in.” And questions about what happens next, it’s some version of:It’s unpatriotic to ask. It’s untoward to ask.But they themselves kind of admit thatwe’re not really sure about that. All we know is that we have to go in, and the operations of Hamas on October 7 have forced us to do that.Rosin:So there is, as far as you can say, no step two. There’s just step one: Root out Hamas in whatever way we have to do that. That’s as far as we’ve gone.Wood:I mean, I’m sure within Israeli planning, there are different ideas about how to proceed. but it’s not something that Israel has come out and said,We know how this is going to look. All they’ve said isWe know where it ends. It ends with the total annihilation of Hamas and, possibly for years to come, the hunting down of every single person who was involved in these atrocities.Rosin:You use the wordwrath. Why do you use that word?Wood:I think that there is no other word for it other thanwrath. I mean, there is a belief that the response has to be maybe proportionate, maybe even disproportionate.I was, the other day,in Sderot, which is one of the fairly large communities that was attacked. There were 30,000 people in it, as of a week and a half ago. Right now, they’ve all been transferred elsewhere. The Israeli government has let some journalists in and has brought out politicians, members of these communities. And there was one guy, who was from Kibbutz Be’eri, which lost on the order of 100 people, I think. And seemed like a nice guy. He described himself as being in favor of peace. He described his community as being one that welcomed cooperation with Gazans before, and he said, “I’m still in favor of peace, but that place needs to be leveled.”He used the wordleveled. That’s a view that I think is not uncommon. And it’s very hard to hear, because the view that Israel is going to annihilate Gaza is different from the one that the Israeli government wants to put out there. The Israeli government wants to say thatwe are going to annihilate Hamas, and in so doing, we will actually liberate the people of Gaza who have been under the thumb of Hamas.And yet there are Israelis all over—not just the ones who are directly affected by the destruction of their communities along the Gaza border—who use language that is annihilationist.Rosin:So what do you make of that? I mean, that feels like it has big implications, if someone who describes himself as previously believing in peace is now more extreme than his own government.Wood:Yeah, I think we’re still in a phase where this mode of wrath is the dominant one. There is also a phase that will have to come that is more practical—more practical and more moral, too. I mean, the flattening of Gaza would be an unspeakable tragedy and crime.So I think what happens next is surely an invasion, but after that, a kind of reengagement of Israel’s reality principle, which means understanding that Gaza, in the end, unless terrible crime is committed against it, is going to still be a place that is Muslim; it’s going to be Palestinian, and it’s going to have to have some kind of modus vivendi with its neighbor, Israel.Right now that thought, it’s unthinkable, I think, for a lot of Israelis, because of the anger that they feel, the pain that they feel. I don’t know when that shift is going to happen, but it’s going to have to coincide with the realities of a military mission—remember that Israel was in Gaza. There were settlements there until more than 15 years ago, and Israel left because it decided that it was not good for the continued health of Israel as a Jewish state. So that reality will not have changed, but at the moment, most Israelis I speak to, including government officials, don’t want to imagine that moment.They are saying simply thatthere’s one sole objective right now, which is to destroy Hamas, and then whatever comes after that, well, we’ll figure it out once that moment comes. But Hamas’s destruction is the only thing we’re going to think about until then, monomaniacally.Rosin:Yeah. Wow. So Israel has no step two at the moment. Does Hamas? That’s after the break.[Music]Rosin:I want to switch to talking about Hamas. When the Hamas militants bulldozed through the fence, puncturing the myth that the Israeli military is invincible—that’s what happened initially—do you have a sense, on Hamas’s side, if there was a step two, what that step two would be? What did they expect out of all of this?Wood:Yeah, when the attack initially happened, when you see this incredibly well-planned, stealthily planned operation unfold, you wonder where it all leads. And so it started off with trained Hamas fighters breaking through the fence and, with startling ease, taking over military outposts of Israel. It ended with ordinary citizens of Gaza coming through and looting Israeli towns on that border. So we’re talking about not a disciplined military force, but people coming through and stealing children’s bicycles and solar panels and stuff from Israelis’ houses after those Israelis have been murdered or burned alive.It’s still not clear exactly how much of this was planned or which aspects of it were planned or what was expected by Hamas, but it seems quite possible that Hamas was just way more successful than it expected to be and that its people—and those who joined in once the fence was down—were way more savage than they expected to be.Rosin:What about the hostages? Because that seems likeastrategy. I don’t know if it’s an intentional strategy, but it’s certainly become important as this all unfolds.Wood:Yeah, the state of the hostages is probably the aspect of this that Israel has least come to terms with. When I spoke earlier of the fact that there is still this traumatic stage that the country was in—everybody in Israel remembers the very long period years ago when Gilad Shalit was captive by Hamas in Gaza. This is an Israeli conscript who was kidnapped from the Kerem Shalom border post, and then kept in some horrible dungeon for years while there was an effort to negotiate his freedom, which came at the cost of freeing over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.This galvanized the whole country. I mean, you’d see images of Gilad Shalit on the street in Jerusalem. And that was one guy; it was one guy who, for years, was one of the major political causes in Israel. And now we’ve got almost 200 Israelis—and not all of them, not even most of them, I believe, soldiers—who have disappeared into Gaza. And the idea of there being 199 Gilad Shalits is inconceivable.Hamas already said that if civilian dwellings are destroyed without warning by Israel, then they will kill hostages. They will kill them on camera. So Hamas, of course, considers them valuable. And, again, the processing is still going on, I think, on the Israeli side. I haven’t heard too much about exactly what the calculation is going to be.Releasing 1,000 prisoners per hostage release is not sustainable. I have no idea how Israel is going to make this calculation and proceed. And I have no idea how Hamas is either.Rosin:You mentioned that before this there was a raging debate over the soul of Israel, sort of internal civil war,would they remain a democracy?Now it sounds like what we hear from inside is that the current government of Benjamin Netanyahu is collapsing, or its support is collapsing. What does that mean, or what could that mean?Wood:Yeah, so if you asked Israelis a month ago what’s the biggest issue, then everybody knew that it was the question of judicial reform and the follow-on effects of that. Whether the right-wing government led by Benjamin Netanyahu would be able to change the Israeli political system so it would be less constrained by the results of a far more liberal judiciary. And everybody knew that that was important.So the effects of the Hamas attack on October 7 are simply cataclysmic for the country’s politics. First of all, nobody cares about judicial reform anymore. That is simply on the back burner. It will not be taken up until the war is finished. Second of all, the hatred of the Israeli government, and maybe even more than that, the Israeli state, is very difficult to exaggerate. And I’m talking about people who were once knee-jerk supporters of Netanyahu, very eager to watch him succeed in the judicial overhaul, feel like they were just betrayed. Netanyahu had—for a long time, one of his value propositions to the Israeli people was that he had presided over a period of peace.And the failure of Israel to secure its citizens on October 7 has left people absolutely livid. There were Israelis who, rather than getting the response of an [Israel Defense Forces] commando unit coming to their homes and freeing them within minutes or even an hour, were waiting 10 hours. Ten hours! You can drive back and forth, top to bottom in this country in 10 hours. And somehow these people were left at the mercy of terrorists who burned them to death.And for Israelis who thought thatat least we have safety; at least we’re in a country where the lives of Jews are taken seriously, protected—apparently the government can’t even do that. And what was it doing in the meantime?They’re furious to think that there was political bickering taking place, there was safeguarding of political reputations, while Israelis were left defenseless, simply defenseless. And the anger is just indescribable from all sides at this government. Their reputations are toast.Rosin:So we just don’t know where that will lead, but we know that for now. What about the future leadership of Palestinians?Wood:If Israel’s threat is followed through, and I have little doubt that they will do this, then the leadership of Hamas will be hunted. They’re already hunted. And Israel will make it impossible for them to govern Gaza. The rest of the Palestinian leadership, of course, in the West Bank of the Palestinian Authority, led by Abu Mazen, who’s in his 80s.The Palestinian Authority is, of course, an enemy of Hamas. They lost the power struggle with Hamas, and they will be the sort of last Palestinian power structure that’s standing if Hamas is dismantled, as Israel promises. But first of all, the Palestinian Authority has many enemies within the Israeli state and within Israel, to say the least, and it’s not clear that they could stand up to control Gaza, given that they had lost the power struggle there before. So there’s a great big power vacuum. This is part of the mess that Israel has not publicly reckoned with, because it is so convinced that nothing else matters other than getting rid of Hamas. Whatever could come next, whatever mess we have, it can’t be worse than having a government on the border with an armed military unit that will do what it just did again. So, yeah, finding out the future of Palestinian leadership is one of those cans that Israel seems to be kicking down the road.Rosin:Before this, there were reports of Israel moving closer to Saudi Arabia, glimmers of a realignment in the Middle East. Where is that now, and how does this change that realignment?Wood:Israel had normalized relations with a number of Arab states—UAE, Bahrain, Morocco—and there was talk of Saudi Arabia being the next, more than talk. I mean, Saudi Arabia and Israel have quietly had this security relationship that has actually been pretty cordial. They share as an enemy the Islamic Republic of Iran. And there is some question about whether Israel would make peace with, have diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia.And the possibility of that normalization, which was set to be one of the great achievements of the Netanyahu government, it’s absolutely impossible right now. There’s no way that that could happen, simply because there’s hundreds, thousands of Palestinians who are being killed.And the only reason that Saudi Arabia could have contemplated normalization with Israel was that the last 10 years have been relatively quiet. I mean, there hasn’t been the mass production of horrible images of Arab death in Gaza and the West Bank. Now there is, which means that any Arab country that was contemplating joining the crew of Arab countries that are friendly to Israel has to step back or risk incurring the wrath of their own people, which could mean the change of the regime in some of these countries, Saudi Arabia being one. Even some of the countries that are already at peace with Israel, such as Egypt—Egypt and Jordan have to wonder what the price might be of that peace if the war continues to be as horrible as it looks like it will be.Rosin:Well, that for Hamas maybe counts as an accomplishment. I mean, watching Israel move toward Saudi Arabia, even if the immediate on-the-ground strategy seems nihilistic, maybe there’s a broader strategy that makes sense.Wood:Yeah, I’ve even heard Israeli government officials say that Saudi Arabia has changed so much in its posture toward jihadism, formerly winking at it, being associated with intolerant versions of Sunni Islam. And now Israeli officials will say,We were about to make peace with a moderate Muslim country called Saudi Arabia, and Hamas tried to destroy that.So it’s a sentence that I never expected to hear. But that is, in fact, one of the effects of the October 7 attacks and their aftermath, is that Israel’s attempts to make peace with countries like Saudi Arabia just are going to be put on hold, as Hamas would prefer.Rosin:Graeme, thank you so much for joining us from there, and good luck.Wood:Thanks, Hanna.[Music]Rosin:This episode ofRadio Atlanticwas produced by Kevin Townsend.

What Hamas's New Document Does and Doesn't Say ,2017-05-01,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"Hamas unveiled Monday anew political documentsupporting the establishment of a Palestinian state based on 1967 lines, marking a rhetorical shift just days ahead of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s visit to Washington.“Hamas advocates the liberation of all of Palestine but is ready to support the state on 1967 borders without recognizing Israel or ceding any rights,” Khaled Meshaal, the group’s leader, said at the unveiling of the 42-point document Monday in Doha, the Qatari capital, where he is based.Though the two-state policy has been the bedrock of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process for more than two decades, Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip and which the U.S. and Israel regard as a terrorist organization, has never formally accepted the agreement, calling instead for Israel’s destruction. While the new document reaffirms the group’s belief that “no part of the land of Palestine shall be compromised or conceded,” it goes on to characterize a Palestinian state based on the 1967 armistice lines as “a formula of national consensus.”"
The Foreign Policy Milestones of 2017,2016-12-07,TheAtlantic,['James M. Lindsay'],"Anniversaries mark the passage of time, recall our triumphs, and honor our losses. 2016 witnessedmany significant historical anniversaries: the75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, the50th anniversary of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and the25th anniversary of the Gulf War, to name a few. 2017 will also see anniversaries of many significant events. Here are ten of note:Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the Signing of the Maastricht Treaty, February 7, 1992TheEuropean Unionfinds itself in the midst of an identity crisis these days. Economic growth islimping along, theBritish want out, andEuroskepticismis gaining ground. Perhaps the 25th anniversary ofthe Maastricht Treatywill help the EU regain its mojo. What the 12 members of the “European Economic Community” (EEC) committed themselves to a quarter century ago was remarkable. They weren’t content with having a common economic market. They wanted deeper economic, legal, and political integration. In advancing this “European Project,” Maastricht called for enhancing greater economic cooperation, developing aunified European foreign policy, and generatingcommon judicial policies. The experiment with deeper integration worked—for a time. The EU grew to 28 member countries,created the euro, and had serious people talking about howEurope would run the 21st century. Then came theGreat Recession. Seven years of tough economic times have exposed deep divisions across the continent about the European project. The EU’s fans say that its past stumbles have always led to more and deeper integration. Perhaps. But sometimes past performance is a poor indicator of future behavior."
The Emptiness of the Ramaswamy Doctrine,2023-08-31,TheAtlantic,['Jacob Heilbrunn'],"Vivek Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old entrepreneur running for the Republican presidential nomination, has initiated a war against what he views as an outdated, establishment foreign policy. He isdeeply skepticalof NATO. Hewants toswiftly end the war in Ukraine, detach Russia from China, and compel Taiwan to defend itself without America. He alsoproposedreducing American financial aid to Israel, a stance long considered politically impossible on the right, before saying he would do so only with Israel’s approval. This week, Ramaswamy attempted to justify such stands with an essay inThe American Conservativecalled “A Viable Realism and Revival Doctrine.”Invoking Presidents George Washington, James Monroe, and Richard Nixon—whom Ramaswamy has called “the most underappreciated president of our modern history in this country, probably in all of American history”—the article appears to be an effort to lend coherence and gravitas to Ramaswamy’s worldview. It also seems to be an attempt to counter the attack by former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley that he has “no foreign policy experience, and it shows.” In the article, Ramaswamy promises to restore American national pride and identity after decades of feckless liberal internationalist and neoconservative policies. “We will be Uncle Sucker no more,” he writes."
The Tragedy of Mahmoud Abbas,2018-01-21,TheAtlantic,['Grant Rumley'],"Picture a Palestinian leader in the twilight of his reign. Besieged on all sides and challenged by younger upstarts, he lashes out against Israel, his Arab brethren, and the United States. Other Palestinian officials jockey to replace him, convinced he’s past his prime. This is how it ended for Yasser Arafat, whose insistence on waging the secondintifadaleft him isolated in the final years of his rule. It may well be how it ends for Mahmoud Abbas.Last Sunday, the 82-year-old Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, gave aspeechin front of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s Central Council. Over two rambling hours, hedeployedanti-Semitic tropes,undercutthe Jewish connection to Israel, andblamedeveryone from Oliver Cromwell to Napoleon to Winston Churchill for Israel’s creation. He repeatedlycursedPresident Donald Trump (“may your house fall into ruin”); he has also said he willboycottVice President Mike Pence’s upcoming visit. He issued indirectrebukesof Arab leaders (“no one has the right to interfere with our affairs”) after days ofreportedlyconfrontationalmeetings with other Gulf officials (“if [they] really want to help the Palestinian people, support us, and give us a real hand. If not, you can all go to hell”).It’s a dramatic turn for a once mild-mannered bureaucrat, who ascended to power in part because of his ability to ease tensions with Arab countries and pursue diplomatic backchannels. “I say to the Israeli leadership and to the Israeli people,” Abbasdeclaredin his inaugural address 13 years ago this month, “we are two peoples destined to live side by side, and to share this land between us.” Since then, he’slosta parliamentary election and governance ofGazato Hamas, his Islamist rivals. Over a decade into his reign, most Palestiniansno longersupport him."
Egypt’s Gaza Problem,2023-10-19,TheAtlantic,['Steven A. Cook'],"Israel is not the only Middle Eastern power that has a tortured relationship with the Gaza Strip. Although it’s not a combatant in the current war, Egypt has played an important role in the immiseration of Gazans over the past 16 years, as together with Israel it has sealed the air, land, and sea borders around the strip.Keeping Hamas out of the Sinai Peninsula has been an imperative for the Egyptian government since at least 2007, when the Islamist group defeated the security forces of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority in Gaza in a short civil war. Hamas’s success could inspire extremists in Egypt, Cairo reasoned, and so the blockade of the strip served Egypt’s interests as well as Israel’s.The last round of violence in Gaza took place in 2014, a year after Major General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power in Egypt in a coup d’état that overthrew Mohamed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Then, Egyptian leaders reasoned that having Israel mortally damage Hamas, itself a late-1980s creation of the Palestine branch of the Brotherhood, would greatly diminish the Islamist threat to both countries. And so Egypt privately counseled Israel to destroy Hamas. But the Israelis demurred, fearing the chaos and power vacuum that would likely result."
Jim Jordan Could Have a Long Fight Ahead,2023-10-17,TheAtlantic,['Russell Berman'],"Updated at 3:46 p.m. ET on October 17, 2023On Friday, immediately after nominating Representative Jim Jordan as their latest candidate for speaker, House Republicans took a second, secret-ballot vote. The question put to each lawmaker was simple: Would you support Jordan in a public vote on the House floor?The results were not encouraging for the pugnacious Ohioan. Nearly a quarter of the House Republican conference—55 members—said they would not back Jordan. Given the GOP’s threadbare majority, he could afford to lose no more than three Republicans on the vote. Jordan’s bid seemed to be fizzling even faster than that of Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, whose nomination earlier in the week lasted barely a day before hebowed outin the face of opposition from within the party.Yet, by this afternoon, Jordan had flipped dozens of holdouts to put himself closer to winning the speakership. The 55 Republicans who said last week that they wouldn’t support him had dwindled to 20 when the House voted this afternoon. He earned a total of 200 votes on the floor; he’ll need 217 to win. Jordan will now try to replicate the strategy that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy used to capture the top House post in January: wearing down his opposition, vote by painful vote. It took McCarthy 15 ballots to secure the speakership, but Jordan may not need that many. The Republicans who voted against him on the floor have not displayed the defiance that characterized the conservatives who overthrew McCarthy. Several of them have told reporters that they could be persuaded to vote for Jordan, or would not stand in the way if he neared the threshold of 217 votes needed to win."
Could Trump Be Palestinians' Best Hope?,2017-05-23,TheAtlantic,['Dalia Hatuqa'],"Recent events have left Palestinians in an odd position: The absence of a clear strategy by a U.S. administration to resolve the conflict with Israel may have become the best bet for statehood they’ve had in years. This, at least, seems to be the thinking of Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority (PA), whometwith U.S. President Donald Trump in the West Bank city of Bethlehem today.Only a few months ago, Palestinians feared being isolated by Trump, who had surrounded himself with pro-Israel advisers closely linked to the settlement enterprise, a movement that aims to block the establishment of a Palestinian state by colonizing land in the West Bank. But today, those concerns have given way to hope that the business tycoon many Palestinians regard as a diplomatic novice will actually deliver where his more experienced predecessors have failed. They are betting that Trump’s ad hoc style and much-touted negotiating skills could pave the way for a final-status deal and eventual statehood.Palestinian leaders view Trump’s inexperience in foreign affairs and a lack of knowledge in Mideast politics as an asset. In a twist of fate, his seemingly clean slate has breathed new optimism into the Palestinian leadership, which looks to portray itself as a necessary security asset in a lawless region.“If Hillary Clinton had been elected, the Palestinians would now be meeting with [former Middle East envoy] Dennis Ross to discuss small confidence-building steps in the West Bank,” Nathan Thrall, author of the recently released book,The Only Language They Understand: Forcing Compromise in Israel and Palestine, told me. “It would amount to putting a pretty face on basically the same [Israeli] occupation, slightly adjusted, while putting off any potential resolution of the conflict for at least four years.”Palestinian optimism has been further fueled by Trump’stalkof an “ultimate deal” to solve the seemingly intractable conflict. So far, and despite his campaign pledge to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem—a move the Palestinians staunchly oppose—it remains in Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, U.S. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster recently spoke of Palestinian “self-determination,” a euphemism for statehood. And on Tuesday in Bethlehem, Trump said he was “truly hopeful” the United States can mediate an agreement between the Palestinians and Israel.These examples have so far exceeded whatever low expectations the Palestinian leadership had, and dismissed their initial fears that the new administration would effectively ignore them.“The Palestinian Authority leadership felt terrified that they will be completely marginalized, sidelined and neglected,” Alaa Tartir, program director of Al Shabaka, The Palestinian Policy Network, told me. “They devoted lots of effort ... and sent delegations to urge Trump to meet Abbas,” turning the outreach into something of “a national priority.”Trump’s opening to Abbas was an accomplishment in itself: He was one of only a handful of leaders invited to the White House in Trump’s first few months in office. On May 3, he stood side-by-side with the new president, beaming with pride, as Trump lauded him for his role in signing the Oslo Accords in 1993. Abbas reciprocated, praising Trump’s “leadership, stewardship, wisdom, and great negotiation ability.”"
The West Must Defeat Russia,2023-11-10,TheAtlantic,['Anne Applebaum'],"They planned to take Kyiv in three days, the rest of Ukraine in six weeks.More than 21 months later, Russian forces have withdrawn from half the territory they occupied in February of last year. At least88,000 Russian soldiers are likely dead—a conservative estimate—and at least twice as many have been wounded. Billions of dollars worth of equipment, Russian tanks, planes, artillery, helicopters, armored vehicles, and warships have been destroyed. If you had predicted this outcome before the war—and nobody did—it would have seemed fanciful. No one would have believed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a professional comedian, could lead a country at war, that the democratic world would be united enough to help him, or that Russian President Vladimir Putin would endure such a humiliation.Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union have achieved something remarkable: Working together, they have not only preserved the Ukrainian state, but stood up to a bully whose nihilism harms the entire world. Putin backs far-right and extremist movements in Europe, provides thugs to support African dictatorships, and colludes with China, Iran, Venezuela, and other autocracies. From the beginning, Putin hoped the war would demonstrate that American power and American alliances can be defeated, not only in Ukraine but everywhere else. He still does, and for this purpose the war remains useful to him."
The Israeli Crisis Is Testing Biden’s Core Foreign-Policy Claim,2023-10-12,TheAtlantic,['Ronald Brownstein'],"President Joe Biden’s core foreign-policy argument has been that his steady engagement with international allies can produce better results for America than the impulsive unilateralism of his predecessor Donald Trump. The eruption of violence in Israel is testing that proposition under the most difficult circumstances.The initial reactions of Biden and Trump to the attack have produced exactly the kind ofpersonalcontrast Biden supporters want to project. On Tuesday, Biden delivered a powerful speech that was impassioned but measured in denouncing the Hamas terror attacks and declaring unshakable U.S. support for Israel. Last night, in a rambling address in Florida, Trump praised the skill of Israel’s enemies, criticized Israel’s intelligence and defense capabilities, and complained that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had tried to claim credit for a U.S. operation that killed a top Iranian general while Trump was president.At this somber moment, Trump delivered exactly the sort of erratic, self-absorbed performance that his critics have said make him unreliable in a crisis. Trump’s remarks seemed designed to validate what Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that focuses on the Middle East, had told me in an interview a few hours before the former president’s speech. “This is the most delicate moment in the Middle East in decades,” Murphy said. “The path forward to negotiate this hostage crisis, while also preventing other fronts from opening up against Israel, necessitates A-plus-level diplomacy. And you obviously never saw C-plus-level diplomacy from Trump.”"
"Photos of the Week: Ghost Rider, Canoe Slalom, Balloon Museum",,TheAtlantic,['Alan Taylor'],
"The Populist’s Guide to Scandal, Jeremy Corbyn Edition",2018-08-28,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"LONDON—It’s the scandal that keeps going—and so, somehow, does the man at its center. When allegations of anti-Semitism within Britain’s Labour Party burst into full-on political crisis in March, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters insisted anti-Semitism was not tolerated in the party and vowed to root it out. But the hits kept coming. There were revelations that Corbynhad likenedIsrael to the Nazis, andthat he had attendeda controversial wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of a terrorist behind the massacre of Israeli athletes in Munich. Most recentlythere was the emergenceof a 2013 video, in which Corbyn at a conference had dismissively referred to “Zionists”—a term referring to those who support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state, but which has also been appropriated by some anti-Semites as a slur for Jews—and declared they had no sense of English irony.It’s unclear what irony Corbyn was referring to, though it hardly seems to matter. What stands out is that the Labour leader was openly singling out Britain’s Jews—90 percentof whom identify as supporters of Israel (though not necessarily its government’s policies)—for in his view not being British enough. The remarks elicited another wave of backlash against Corbyn, including from members of his own party. The Labour lawmaker David Lammy called the comments“insidious.” Luciana Berger, another Labour lawmaker,saidthe video “makes me as a proud British Jew feel unwelcome in my own party.”"
From Feminist to Right-Wing Conspiracist,2023-09-12,TheAtlantic,['Helen Lewis'],"In 2019, a mnemonic began to circulate on the internet: “If the Naomi be Klein / you’re doing just fine / If the Naomi be Wolf / Oh, buddy. Ooooof.” The rhyme recognized one of the most puzzling intellectual journeys of recent times—Naomi Wolf’s descent into conspiracism—and the collateral damage it was inflicting on the Canadian climate activist and anti-capitalist Naomi Klein.Until recently, Naomi Wolf was best known for her 1990s feminist blockbusterThe Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, which argued that the tyranny of grooming standards—all that plucking and waxing—was a form of backlash against women’s rights. But she is now one of America’s most prolific conspiracy theorists, boasting on her Twitter profile of being “deplatformed 7 times and still right.” Shehas claimedthat vaccines are a “software platform” that can “receive ‘uploads’ ” and is mildly obsessed with the idea that many clouds aren’t real, butare instead evidenceof “geoengineered skies.” Although Wolf has largely disappeared from the mainstream media, she is now a favored guest on Steve Bannon’s podcast,War Room.All of this is particularly bad news for Klein, for the simple reason that people keep mistaking the two women for each other. Back in 2011, when she first noticed the confusion—from inside a bathroom stall, she heard two women complain that “Naomi Klein” didn’t understand the demands of the Occupy movement—this was merely embarrassing. The movement sprang from Klein’s part of the left, and in October of that year she was invited to speak to Occupy New York. Was it their shared first name, their Jewishness, or their brown hair with blond highlights? Even their partners’ names were similar: Avram Lewis and Avram Ludwig. Klein was struck that both had experienced rejection from their peer groups (in her case, by fellow students when she first criticized Israel in the college newspaper)."
The High School That Banned Amnesty International,2016-05-09,TheAtlantic,['Conor Friedersdorf'],"In New Albany, Ohio, a 17-year-old girl with an interest in advancing human rights tried to start a student chapter of Amnesty International at her public high school. But her principal forbade her from doing so, capitulating to critics of the group.The conflict began with a controversial poster.To advertise the new group she was starting, the 17-year-old, Ellie Henze, made a poster with a photo of an anti-war protest. One protester in the photo had a “Free Palestine” sign.Off-campus critics quickly objected,according toThe Columbus Dispatch:"
The Reckoning That Is Coming for Qatar,2023-10-20,TheAtlantic,['Hussein Ibish'],"As Israel and Hamas sink deeper into conflict, Doha finds itself in a delicate position. As a long-standing backer of theMuslim Brotherhood, Qatar has huge influence over the movement’s Palestinian affiliate, Hamas. That offers a significant opportunity in the short run. Doha’s deep connections with the Gaza-based Islamist group make Qatar a central player in the current diplomatic game. But for exactly the same reason, Doha faces the looming risk of being called to account over its record of support for such radical Islamist groups, and especially for Hamas.Doha has a long history of serving as a broker, and in the past, this has often worked well for the Gulf state. By allowing the Taliban to establish a Doha office, Qatar provided the U.S. with a channel for negotiations with the group. Doha thus facilitated the agreement to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan concluded under the Trump administration andcarried out by President Joe Bidenin 2021."
How to Have a Healthy Argument,2023-11-23,TheAtlantic,['Hanna Rosin'],"I’ve heard of three Thanksgiving plans that got canceled because of disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war. In one case, over the past few weeks, a guy watched as his brother’s wife posted pictures of cease-fire rallies on Facebook. Finally he texted her: “So you love Hamas now?” She was horrified. After doing Thanksgiving together for two decades, they will not be continuing the tradition this year.I could give you more examples of unproductive fights that ended plans, friendships, relationships, but we’ve all been there. In this week’s episode ofRadio Atlantic, we focus less on the substance of any of those disagreements. Instead, we talk about how to disagree, on things big (a war) or small (how to load the dishwasher). Our guest is Amanda Ripley, the author ofHigh Conflict: Why We Get Trapped and How We Get Out, and her suggestions work equally well in the personal or political arena.We also talk with Utah Governor Spencer Cox about hisDisagree Betterinitiative. In 2020 Cox ran an unusualpolitical adin which he appeared alongside his opponent, noting that they have different political views but agreeing they would both “fully support the results of the upcoming presidential election regardless of the outcome.” Cox, a former trial lawyer who says he is inclined “towards conflict when presented with opposing views,” is a rare politician trying to work with opponents in a different way.Listen to the conversation here:The following is a transcript of the episode:Hanna Rosin:This isRadio Atlantic. I’m Hanna Rosin. Today is Thanksgiving, a time for families to get together and, often, to disagree, in an era when a lot of us have totally lost the art of disagreeing well.I could explain or give you so many examples, but I think you probably know what I mean. One of our presidential candidates just called his opponents “vermin.”So today we’re going to have a conversation about learning to disagree better. And I know that there are some people out there who hear that and think I mean we need to be quiet or to stop protesting or just to be more polite. But it’s not that. It’s about how to talk to people you disagree with—not in a polite, avoidant way, but in a way that’s more effective, that lets everyone get something done.Now, we’re going to hear from two people. One is a prominent politician—maybe one of the few who is actively trying to change how political opponents talk to each other.From him I want to know from him how productive disagreement actually works, in the wild, given the high level of vitriol out there.But before we get to him, we’re going to hear from Amanda Ripley. She’s a journalist who wrote a book calledHigh Conflict: Why We Get Trapped and How We Get Out.A couple of months ago, Amanda and I did a live event together where she explained the ideas in her book, ideas that once I absorbed them, they changed how I digest the news and also how I talk to almost everyone in my life.Here’s our conversation.Rosin:Amanda had suggested we start small and personal. She wanted us both to talk about a fight we’d had with our partners so she could dissect it. I went first.So here we go. Example 1: The Toxic Croissant.Rosin:And yeah, so that’s the petty mystery we started with. Why did I so instinctively feel the need to be right about something I actually didn’t care about, and which another version of me knew was going to ruin a perfectly pleasant interaction? What was I getting from that?Example 2: The Wolves.Now it was Amanda’s turn.Rosin:This is an important insight. High conflict is a very specific state of mind, different from annoyed or angry. It’s more like being possessed by some combination of fury and logic. And it’s not pleasant, exactly, but it is a kind of high.Rosin:Conflict is not just croissants and dishwashers, though. Often the stakes are way higher, like in politics, which is built on disagreement. How do you know when conflict is productive?Rosin:Okay, let’s pause. What Amanda is suggesting is that you should engage in a conflict with no intention of resolving it. In fact, if you have that intention, you will probably make the conflict worse.That’s hard.And what she is proposing seems straightforward, except it’s tricky because understanding might mean, in some cases, giving a lot of airtime to a person who quotes false statistics or spreads conspiracy theories, and that’s especially tricky if this person has power.[Political ad]Rosin:After the break, we’ll hear from Spencer Cox himself. The now-governor of Utah heads something called the Disagree Better initiative, and, to him, this topic is nothing to laugh at.[Music]Rosin:As chair of the National Governors Association, Spencer Cox tours the country evangelizing what he calls “Disagree Better.” Now, the term can sound cute, or vague, so I asked him what he meant by it, because politicians appeal for civility all the time. And his answer echoed a lot of what Amanda and I talked about.Rosin:Cox has field-tested Disagree Better in Utah, which is arguably a low-risk place for him to start. Utah is a solidly red state, and when he ran that political ad in 2020, he was already ahead in the polls. Of red states, Utah also generally seems more open to this kind of message. Donald Trump is of course popular there, but Utah is also the place that sent Trump critic Mitt Romney to the Senate.Rosin:Before he was a politician, Cox was a trial lawyer, and that’s a profession that argues in order to win, not to understand the other person. And now as a public figure, Cox does not always control his tongue, which I asked him about.Rosin:I just had one last question for Cox. It’s a question Amanda always advises to ask, which is: Does the person you’re talking to have any regrets or doubts about their position or about something they’ve done? Because doubts are a place where opponents can find common ground.And Cox did share one big doubt. It was about when he signed acontroversial congressional map back in 2021. This new map split the biggest Democratic-leaning county in the state and divided it among the state’s four districts, which faced immediate accusations of gerrymandering.Rosin:The governor’s people were waiting outside the studio to take him to his next thing.And before I say my goodbye to you—and Happy Thanksgiving, while I’m at it—I wanted to return for a moment to my conversation with Amanda Ripley.We wrapped up by circling back to my argument about the croissant and figuring out the real reason why I reacted the way I did.Rosin:This episode was produced by Kevin Townsend, with editing from Claudine Ebeid. It was fact-checked by Isabel Cristo and engineered by Rob Smierciak. Claudine Ebeid is our executive producer, and Andrea Valdez is our managing editor.Thank you to the See Change Sessions for giving us the audio of my talk with Amanda.Thank you all for listening, and happy Thanksgiving. If you’re at the table and you’re overcome with that feeling that you’re about to fight, do it right. Good luck to you. And see you next Thursday."
The ‘Anti-Defeat’ Candidate,2023-11-21,TheAtlantic,['Mark Leibovich'],"Updated at 8:40 p.m. ET on November 22, 2023Like many politicians, Representative Dean Phillips likes to look people in the eye. And because he’s a politician, Phillips can glean things, just as President George W. Bush did when he peered into Vladimir Putin’s eyes and saw his soul.“I’ve looked Benjamin Netanyahu in the eye,” Phillips told a group of students at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, last week.And?“I did not like what I saw,” Phillips said of the Israeli prime minister. “I do not like his government. He’s got to go.”Philips has also looked into Donald Trump’s eyes. That, too, was ominous. It was a few years ago, and the former president had invited a bunch of new House members to the White House for an introductory visit."
Socially Acceptable Anti-Semitism,2019-03-06,TheAtlantic,['Eliot A. Cohen'],"On Sunday, a floatrolleddown the streets of Aalst, a Belgian town, for carnival. It featured two grotesque caricatures of Hasidic Jews, hooked noses, hands reaching out for money, and a rat sitting on money bags. That’s 2019. A second float, pictured above—in Marburg, Germany, in 1936—featured celebrants dressed as Orthodox Jews. The only real difference is that the former was more elaborately and professionally executed, and if anything more grotesque.Anti-Semitism, or, to speak more plainly, Jew hatred, is the animus that never dies. Like some malignant virus, it always lies dormant, ready to wake. Like other viruses, it may be, at various times, more or less virulent, more or less lethal. There probably will not be a massacre of Jews in Belgium in the next few years. What happened a few years after the float rolled down the streets of Marburg requires no elaboration.In the wake of the Holocaust, the deliberate killing of Jewish, non-Israeli civilians is usually condemned across the political spectrum (butcheries of Israeli civilians being often excused as an understandable expression of Palestinian frustration). But those are easy sentiments, because it costs nothing to sympathize with dead Jews as opposed to standing up for live ones. The virus survives."

The Iran Nuclear Deal Isn’t the Problem. Iran Is.,2021-06-29,TheAtlantic,"['James Jeffrey, Dennis Ross']","Ebrahim Raisi’s election as president of Iran came as no surprise. All those who might have been a threat to him were disqualified. He was the choice of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and small wonder: Few people better embody the ideology of the Islamic Republic. He will not open Iran up to the outside world, and will certainly not look to accommodate the United States in any way. As for Iran’s behavior in the Middle East, he has made clear that it is “not negotiable.”The Israel-Hamas conflict last month was a reminder that nearly everything in the Middle East is connected—and whether we’re talking about Hamas rockets, the ongoing calamity in Yemen, or the Iran nuclear deal, Tehran’s destabilizing role in the region is the common factor.We understand why President Joe Biden seeks a return to the deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. The United States must roll back Iran’s nuclear program and then use the time left before the agreement’s sunset provisions lapse to either produce the longer and stronger deal the Biden administration seeks, or enhance our deterrence so Tehran understands that the U.S. will prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear-threshold state."
There Are No Rules,2023-10-09,TheAtlantic,['Anne Applebaum'],"The “rules-based world order” is a system of norms and values that describe how the world ought to work, not how it actually works. This aspirational order is rooted in the idealistic aftermath of the Second World War, when it was transcribed into a series of documents: the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Genocide Convention, and the Geneva Conventions on the laws of war, among others. In the more than seven decades since they were written, these documents have frequently been ignored. The UN Genocide Convention did not prevent genocide in Rwanda. The Geneva Conventions did not stop the Vietnamese from torturing American prisoners of war, did not prevent Americans at Abu Ghraib from torturing Iraqi prisoners of war, and do not prevent Russians from torturing Ukrainian prisoners of war today. Signatories of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights include known violators of human rights, among them China, Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela. The UN Commission on Human Rights deteriorated into parody long ago.Nevertheless, these documents have influenced real behavior in the real world. Soviet dissidents used to embarrass their government by pointing to human-rights language in treaties the Kremlin had signed and did not respect. Even when fighting brutal or colonial wars, countries that had signed treaties on the laws of war either tried to abide by them—avoiding civilian casualties, for example—or at least felt remorseful when they failed to do so. Americans who mistreated Iraqi prisoners of war were court-martialed, convicted, and sentenced to time in military prisons. The British still agonize over the past behavior of their soldiers in Northern Ireland, and the French over theirs in Algeria."
The Left Abandoned Me,2023-10-12,TheAtlantic,['Gal Beckerman'],"“Did they really decapitate babies?” my 14-year-old daughter asked me yesterday. She was pointing to a text message on her phone from a friend. “They’re saying they found Jewish babies killed, some burnt, some decapitated.” And I froze. Not because I didn’t know what to say—though in truth I didn’t know what to say—but because for a moment I forgot what century I was in. All of the assumptions I had made as a Jewish father, even one who had grown up, as I did, with the Holocaust just a few decades past, were suddenly no longer relevant. Had I adequately prepared her for the reality of Jewish death, what every shtetl child for centuries would have known intimately? Later in the day, she asked if, for safety’s sake, she should take off the necklace she loves that her grandparents had given her and that has her name written out in Hebrew script.The attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians last Saturday broke something in me. I had always resisted victimhood. It felt abhorrent, self-pitying to me in a world that seemed far away from the Inquisition and Babi Yar—especially in the United States, where I live and where polls repeatedly tell me that Jewsare more belovedthan any other religious group. I wasn’t blind to anti-Semitism and the ways it had recently become deadlier, or to the existential dread that my family in Israel felt every time terrorists blew up a bus or café—it’s a story whose sorrows have punctuated my entire life. But I refused to embrace that ironically comforting mantra, “They will always want to kill us.” I hated what this tacitly expressed, thatif they always want to kill us, then we owe them, the world, nothing. I deplore the occupation for both the misery it has inflicted on generations of Palestinians and the way it corrodes Israeli society; when settlers in the West Bank have been attacked, it has pained me, but I have also felt anger that they are even there. In short, I wasn’t locked into the worldview of my survivor grandparents and I felt superior for it."
Trump’s Insidious Reason for Leaving the UN Human Rights Council,2018-06-20,TheAtlantic,['Lauren Wolfe'],"When the Trump administration commits to a decision, it goes full throttle—and often with little regard for the consequences. One such decision was announced Tuesday evening: The United States is withdrawing its membership from the UN Human Rights Council, which it joined in 2008, two years after its creation.The stated reasons for withdrawal ranged from what the Trump administration regards as the council’s seeming lack of interest in addressing abuses in places like Venezuela and Iran, to accusations of partiality. In a press conference on Tuesday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the council a “protector of human-rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias,” and said that “America should not provide it with any credibility.”One of the more obvious reasons for the withdrawal from the council is America’s aversion to what Haley called its “chronic bias” against Israel. She’s been making that case for some time now, telling the body last year that it had a “relentless, pathological campaign”against the country. Even some critics of the U.S. extraction from the council told me that there is some truth to the fact that it does disproportionately single out Israel. One of the council’s longstanding agenda items, for example, is examining human-rights abuses in “Palestine and other Arab territory”—the only item that delineates a particular place or region. Still, for human-rights advocates, the Trump administration’s withdrawal is “a sad reflection of its one-dimensional human-rights policy: defending Israeli abuses from criticism takes precedence above all else,” Human Rights Watch Director Kenneth Roth said Tuesday in a statement."
Trump’s Menacing Rosh Hashanah Message to American Jews,2023-09-19,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"Like most politicians, former President Donald Trump marked the occasion of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, by passing along holiday greetings to American Jews. Unlike most politicians, Trump used the opportunity to threaten them.On Sunday evening, just as Rosh Hashanah was coming to a close, Trumpposteda meme on his social-media platform, Truth Social, excoriating “liberal Jews” who had “voted to destroy America.” (Majorities of American Jews havevotedfor Democrats since before World War II.) “Let’s hope you learned from your mistake,” the caption continued, “and make better choices going forward!”Trump’s Rosh Hashanah broadside was far from the first time that he hadshared objectionable sentimentsabout Jewish people. But it was particularly ugly in the way it deliberately singled out a specific constituency during that constituency’s holiest season. As the conservative writer Philip KleinwroteinNational Review, “Color me skeptical that Trump’s defenders would be so understanding if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer were to post a Merry Christmas message … blaming Christian conservatives for destroying America because they didn’t vote for Democrats.”"
Popcaan Keeps Dancehall Moving Forward—With Its Roots Intact,2018-07-31,TheAtlantic,['Hannah Giorgis'],"Popcaan is always in motion, but his voice beckons home. When he answers my call last Friday, a week after the release ofForever, his second studio album, the prolific dancehall singer is quick to tell me he’s in the car. As if to confirm the veracity of his claim, an unknown vehicle in the background honks its horn seconds later. The sound interrupts our conversation with an abrupt blare. When I ask where he’s headed, the artist born Andrae Sutherland adopts a high, singsongy tone crackling with amusement: “I’m goooo-iiiiing for some billions, for the gloooory.”Answering questions with rhythm and flair has long been Popcaan’s calling card. It was, after all, a jovial call-and-response that first ushered the St. Thomas Parish–born singer into dancehall fans’ regular rotation back in 2010. Vybz Kartel, the multiplatinum “king of the dancehall” born Adidja Azim Palmer, shouted out a young Sutherland on “Clarks,” the impossibly catchy dedication to the sensible British shoe brand beloved by Jamaicans across the world. “Wha gwan, Popcaan?” the Portmore-bred Kartel asked on the track’s intro, before ceding the mic to Popcaan for the pre-hook. “Deh yah enuh hot skull, but tell me something,” Popcaan mused, before asking Palmer, “A where you get that new Clarks there Addi?”"
How the Trump Administration Could Get Sucked Further Into Syria,2017-04-09,TheAtlantic,['Dominic Tierney'],"In 49 BCE, Julius Caesar traveled with his troops to the banks of the Rubicon river in northern Italy. By an ancient law, no Roman general was allowed to cross the river with an army. Caesar paused momentarily, weighing the terrifying prospect of civil war. Then, according to the Roman historianSuetonius, Caesar declared “the die is cast,” and swept south toward Rome. This week, President Trump struck a Syrian airfield with dozens of cruise missiles, following an attack by the Syrian regime on civilians with sarin nerve gas. Has Trump crossed his own Rubicon, and reached a point of no return, with the prospect of full-scale embroilment in the Syrian morass?There’s good reason to think the air strikes will be an isolated event. After all, none of the key players in Syria have an interest in triggering a major conflict. Bashar al-Assad is winning the civil war. Why snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by taking on the U.S. military? Meanwhile, Trump has long pressed for getting out of wars in the Middle East, and focusing on nation-building at home. Similarly, Russia has no desire for a larger contest against the United States. Trump’sproposedincreasein U.S. defense spending is about the same as Russia’sentiredefense spending. Trumpreportedlyreceived three options for a military strike, and chose the most limited. All of this suggests that cooler heads may prevail.But the history of recent U.S. military operations shows how missions can morph unexpectedly into larger endeavors. “Once on the tiger’s back,”warnedUndersecretary of State George Ball about U.S. intervention in Vietnam, “we cannot be sure of picking the place to dismount.” America’s recent big wars—in Afghanistan and Iraq—were supposed to be speedy regime change operations, but both turned into costly and prolonged counter-insurgency campaigns. Smaller-scale peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, which might seem more analogous to the Syrian strikes, were also subject to mission creep. For example, the U.S. intervention in Lebanon in 1982 began as part of a multinational effort to oversee the withdrawal of Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) fighters from Beirut. This mission went smoothly, but the goals broadened and the United States became an active player in the Lebanese civil war—until a suicide bomber struck the marine barracks and killed 241 Americans. Similarly, the humanitarian mission in Somalia in 1992 started out as a limited operation to deliver food but shifted into a broader nation-building operation to stabilize war-torn Somalia—a road that led to the deaths of 18 Americans in the “Black Hawk Down” battle.Of course, these interventions all involved U.S. ground troops from the start, so what about bombing campaigns? Again, the tiger’s back often proved a bumpy ride. In 1999, NATO launched air strikes to force Serbia to remove its troops from Kosovo. Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic responded by weaponizing refugees, terrorizing Kosovo’s civilians and sending them fleeing to the border in a bid to split the NATO coalition. The air war dragged on for months, and NATO was looking at the grim prospect of a ground invasion, when Milosevic suddenly caved. Perhaps the best analogy to the Syrian strikes is Libya in 2011, which began as an air campaign to shield civilians but quickly escalated into a war to overthrow Qaddafi. A British Parliament inquiryconcludedthat, “By the summer of 2011, the limited intervention to protect civilians had drifted into an opportunist policy of regime change.”"
How the Palestinian Authority Failed Its People,2023-10-19,TheAtlantic,['Ghaith al-Omari'],"As the war in Gaza continues to intensify, the Palestinian Authority has been conspicuously quiet. Since its establishment in 1993, and particularly since the Second Intifada, in the early 2000s, the PA has been losing credibility not only diplomatically but also among the Palestinian people. Hamas rushed to fill the subsequent vacuum in ideas, politics, and security. Today the Palestinian people are paying the price. Any political arrangement made after this war in Gaza needs to focus not just on the future of the coastal strip but also on rehabilitating the PA.Since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the Palestinian people have been presented with two competing, irreconcilable visions of their future. One, posited by the Palestine Liberation Organization—a secular, though by no means democratic, group and the parent of the Palestinian Authority—envisioned a diplomatic process leading to a Palestinian state side by side with Israel. The other, promoted by Hamas, a designated terrorist group and a member of the larger Muslim Brotherhood network, called for the establishment of a Palestinian state from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean—in other words, the destruction of Israel—to be achieved through violence. Diplomacy, terror, governance, charities, political organizing, messaging: The opponents used all tools at their disposal to advance their objectives both on the ground and in the hearts and minds of Palestinians."
Is Trump Going to War With Iran?,2018-07-23,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"In atweetlate Sunday, President Donald Trump warned Iran of “consequences the likes of which few throughout history have suffered before,” seemingly raising the odds of military conflict with one of the most powerful armed forces in the Middle East. He was responding to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’sremarks to Iranian diplomatsthat “America should know thatpeace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.”Trump’s all-caps message may make it seem as if conflict with the Islamic Republic is inevitable. But just as Rouhani held out of the prospect of the “mother of all peace,” Trump’s message is reminiscent of his threats against the “madman” Kim Jong Un. He threatened the North Korean leader with “fire and fury,” and added that the North Korean leader will “be tested like never before.” Just months after making those remarks, Trump was meeting with Kim in Singapore, launching a diplomatic process that, while short on results so far, has been high on optimism. Given the history of U.S.-Iran relations, which were poisoned by the 1979 revolution, such an outcome is highly unlikely with Tehran. But Trump’s unpredictable and independent  foreign policy means, as he said last November, he’s the “only one that matters.”"

France’s Jews Look to Pittsburgh ‘Across a Narrow Bridge’,2018-10-31,TheAtlantic,['Rachel Donadio'],"PARIS—So many times in the past few years, as France underwent a wave of terrorist attacks that killed hundreds of people from 2012 to 2016, American Jews would send solidarity to France. The tables now seem to have turned.At a memorial here this week, from a dais adorned with American and French flags, a rabbi at the Mouvement Juif Libéral de France, a Reform synagogue, read aloud the names of the 11 victims killed at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Several hundred worshippers and guests had gathered, along with French public officials, and lit 11 memorial candles. The assembly sang Hebrew prayers and psalms, and the congregation’s rabbis spoke of the need for public officials to call out anti-Semitism in all its forms—around the world.“We thought that the U.S. was a safe place for Jews. It was really shocking to hear about the shooting in the synagogue. For one, it makes you realize that nowhere in the world is safe for us,” Yael Hollenberg, an editor at a Jewish magazine,Tenou’a, told me when I asked her why she had come to the memorial service. “What’s been a reality for us has now become a reality for them,” she added."
"Clare Hollingworth, the Reporter Who Broke the News of World War II, Has Died at 105",2017-01-10,TheAtlantic,['David A. Graham'],"Any big journalistic scoop requires a combination of luck and hustle. It’s only natural that Clare Hollingworth had a lot of both when she scored one of the greatest scoops of the 20thcentury.Hollingworth was born to a industrialist who took her to visit major historical battlefields as a girl. As a young woman, she showed a rebellious spark, breaking off an engagement and going to work for the League of Nations as a secretary. From there, shejumpedto work for a British refugee organization that sent her to Poland after the Allies sanctioned Hitler’s seizure of the Sudetenland. Thanks to anold but still valid German visashe’d gotten for a ski vacation, she was able to enter Germany and shepherd refugees to Poland and then on to safety.That work brought her a measure of fame—she arranged the evacuation of more than 3,500 Jews and dissidents, earning the moniker “the Scarlet Pimpernel,” after Baroness Orczy’s novel,according toTime—but she was abruptly sacked in July 1939,apparentlybecause British intelligence felt she was granting visas to too many people who were either politically or ethnically “undesirable.” She returned to the U.K., got herself accredited byThe Daily Telegraph,and went back to Poland.Back in the field in August of that year, she borrowed a car from an ex-boyfriend in the British Foreign Service, surmising that the Union Jack on the vehicle would get her into Germany without trouble. She was right.“The border guard was a bit surprised when they saw the Union flag flying on the car, but they let me in,”she told theTelegraphin 2011. “I stopped to buy aspirin and white wine and things you couldn’t get inside Poland. And then I was driving back along a valley and there was ahessianscreen up so you couldn’t look down into the valley. Suddenly, there was a great gust of wind which blew the sacking from its moorings, and I looked into the valley and saw scores, if not hundreds, of tanks.”She drove back to Poland and told her ex-boyfriend. He wired the government in London. Hollingworth, meanwhile, filed her dispatch to theTelegraphreporting Hitler’s invasion of Poland—breaking the news of the start of World War II. She was 27 years old and had been a working reporter for three days.The story, which ran without a byline under the heading “From our own correspondent,”according to the newspaper custom of the day, is often described in the British press as “the scoop of the century.”"
The Israeli-Palestinian Dispute Is Only Partly About Land,2019-05-25,TheAtlantic,['Shadi Hamid'],"Is the Israeli-Palestinianconflict fundamentally about land and territory? It is certainly partly about that. But when you hear the objections and grievances of both sides, the issue of who has what part of which territory doesn’t necessarily figure all that prominently.I recently took part in astudy touron religion and nationalism in Israel and the West Bank organized by the Philos Project. One Palestinian official whom we met told us, “I’m not going to compromise my dignity.”The problem with what we know of the Trump administration’s “peace plan” is that it asks Palestinians to do precisely that. The entire Donald Trump approach seems to be premised on calling for unilateral surrender. It is premised on destroying the will of a people, and on hoping that despair might one day turn into acquiescence. This is the only way to interpret Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner’s insistence onprioritizing economic incentivesover political progress, but this misunderstands most of what we know about human motivation."

The 9/11 Speech That Was Never Delivered,2023-09-10,TheAtlantic,['Jeff Nussbaum'],"William Safirewrote in the introduction to his classic compendiumLend Me Your Earsthat “what makes a draft speech a real speech is the speaking of it.” But I’ve found that some of the most interesting speeches written were never delivered at all. I spent years collecting examples of the words that went unspoken because events intervened, or a leader had a change of heart, or history took a sudden turn.Last year, shortly after leaving my role as a special assistant and senior speechwriter for President Joe Biden, I published them as a book. For 19 of the speeches I wrote about—all historically significant, many previously unseen—I could offer readers the full text of what might have been. The 20th remained elusive.I first learned of its existence in 2004, from a report inThe Washington Post. “Top Focus Before 9/11 Wasn’t on Terrorism; Rice Speech Cited Missile Defense,” the front-page headlineread. The story by Robin Wright detailed a speech that was to have been delivered by President George W. Bush’s national-security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, on September 11, 2001. In the excerpts published by thePost, she seemed dismissive of the threat of terrorism: “We need to worry about the suitcase bomb, the car bomb and the vial of sarin released in the subway, [but] why put deadbolt locks on your doors and stock up on cans of mace and then decide to leave your windows open.”"
This War Isn’t Like Israel’s Earlier Wars,2023-10-09,TheAtlantic,['Michael Oren'],"On Saturday night, I was seated on the first El Al plane to fly from the United States to Israel since Hamas had attacked my country. Many airlines had canceled flights to and from Israel, but El Al had refused to grant the terrorists that victory. Though we took off after midnight, sleep was impossible. My mind writhed thinking of the reports of unbearable Israeli casualties, the images of the captured and the dead, and the prospect of wider war.Alongside those waking nightmares was an agonizing irony. I’d just come from participating in events in New York marking the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. Just as in 1973, when Israeli reservists living or vacationing abroad rushed to rejoin their units already in combat, my plane was filled with young men ready to trade the thrills of New York for the horrors of a war under way. Their presence was another reason to reflect on the eerie similarities and stark differences between these two wars, both of which broke out on Jewish holidays—the most solemn, Yom Kippur, and now Simchat Torah, our happiest.War, in Israel, is a recurrent reality. One used to break out every six years or so, but in recent years the distance between conflicts has dwindled. Between 2006 and today, Israel fought four wars with Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza, and a fifth, in Lebanon, with Hezbollah. None, however, could compare to the scope, the destructiveness, and the agony of the Yom Kippur War. That is, until now."
Don’t Take the Narrow View of What’s Happening in Gaza,2021-05-15,TheAtlantic,['Shadi Hamid'],"As always in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, two narratives are vying for primacy. In one, Israel is simply defending itself against a fresh attack. In the other, Israel’s bombardment of Gaza is the latest example of a desire to punish and humiliate Palestinians. These two narratives are not reconcilable, which makes reasoned discussion an exercise in futility. But any sophisticated argument must contend with the long, winding lead-up to the current crisis. Why is war in Gaza returning now, and why does it always seem to return, with stubborn, periodic insistence?Despite inching toward the Democratic Party’s left flank on various domestic- and foreign-policy issues, the Biden administration has fallen back on the usual formulas, offering robotic recitations about “Israel’s right to defend itself.” On Thursday, President Joe Bidensaidthat he hadn’t seen a “significant overreaction” from Israel, while failing to mention a word about Palestinian deaths. In so doing, he gave Israel what amounts to a green light to intensify its bombing campaign."
Netanyahu Sends in the Clowns,2023-06-08,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"If you are a politician, you can respond to public protesters in a variety of ways. You can avoid getting too close to them. You can ignore them. You can use your bully pulpit to address their concerns from a position of strength. What you probably should not do is physically tussle with them or taunt them with childish facial gestures.But that is precisely what a group of visiting Israeli politicians has been doing in New York City over the past week. Last Friday night, Simcha Rothman, a right-wing Israeli lawmaker, was accosted by a group of Israeli demonstrators on the streets of Manhattan. This was not particularly surprising, given that there are many Israelis in the area, and Rothman is the architect of the government’s proposed overhaul of Israel’s judiciary, which has provokedunprecedented outcryin the country itself. Political protests are common in New York, and this small one would likely have gone unnoticed if not for what happened next: Rothman turned around and wrestled a megaphone away from one of the demonstrators, in an incident that wascaught on camera. And he did this on the Sabbath, when religious Jews like himself areforbiddenfrom handling electronic devices. Suddenly, what would have been an unremarkable protest in America became national news in Israel.Rothman wasn’t alone in inadvertently amplifying his antagonists. Two days later, Amichai Chikli, the government’s minister of diaspora affairs, wasphotographedat New York’s Celebrate Israel parade giving what appeared to be the finger to nearby protesters. The image of Chikli rocketed around the web, presented by critics as him flipping off the American Jewish community."
Dr. Ruth on Finding Love After the Pandemic,2021-05-23,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"Much of America is going through a Madonna moment:Like a virgin, touched for the very first time!Brushing against a stranger in a restaurant, clobbering someone with a hug, shaking a new acquaintance’s hand—for those who have stayed isolated over the past 15 months, these experiences can feel novel and exciting and highly weird. Perhaps no one is better suited to advise us on navigating this moment than Dr. Ruth K. Westheimer, America’s favorite nonagenarian sex therapist.Dr. Ruth isn’t just famous for her books, her radio and television shows, and hercameoin a classic Herbal Essences commercial. She has also lived an extraordinary life. Born in 1928 to an Orthodox Jewish family in Frankfurt, Germany, she traveled in aKindertransportconvoyto Switzerland at age 10 as the Nazis rose to power, and spent the rest of her childhood there in a home for orphans. She moved to Mandatory Palestine shortly before the establishment of the state of Israel and served as a sniper in the Haganah, the Jewish paramilitary organization. Later, in America, she spent time as a single mother to her daughter, Miriam. And decades afterward, she survived the death of her longtime husband, Fred Westheimer. Dr. Ruth knows what it means to live through hard times.She was waiting in the hallway when I got off the elevator, standing at her apartment door in moccasin-style slippers after learning of my arrival from her beloved doormen. Right away, I suspected that she would be a formidable interviewee: She was ready for me, and I had no hope of keeping up. Her walls are covered with photos of her grinning at famous people: Bill and Hillary Clinton, Prince Philip. As befits a therapist and talk-radio host, she loves to flip the conversation and ask lots of questions, even when she’s the supposed subject. She had a stack of materials waiting for me at her dining-room table and a checklist of updates about her busy life written in Sharpie on a piece of computer paper. She was charmingly bemused by my searching questions about adjusting to regular life after the pandemic. “Stop constantly talking about how difficult it was!” she told me as we sat together next to the wide, trinket-lined windows in her apartment overlooking the Hudson River. “We all know that. Period.”"
"My Father, My Faith, and Donald Trump",2023-11-28,TheAtlantic,['Tim Alberta'],"This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter.Sign up for it here.It wasJuly 29, 2019—the worst day of my life, though I didn’t know that quite yet.The traffic in downtown Washington, D.C., was inching along. The mid-Atlantic humidity was sweating through the windows of my chauffeured car. I was running late and fighting to stay awake. For two weeks, I’d been sprinting between television and radio studios up and down the East Coast, promoting my new book on the collapse of the post–George W. Bush Republican Party and the ascent of Donald Trump. Now I had one final interview for the day. My publicist had offered to cancel—it wasn’t that important, she said—but I didn’t want to. Itwasimportant. After the car pulled over on M Street Northwest, I hustled into the stone-pillared building of the Christian Broadcasting Network.All in a blur, the producers took my cellphone, mic’d me up, and shoved me onto the set with the news anchor John Jessup. Camera rolling, Jessup skipped past the small talk. He was keen to know, given his audience, what I had learned about the president’s alliance with America’s white evangelicals. Despite being a lecherous, impenitent scoundrel—the 2016 campaign was marked byhis mocking of a disabled man, his xenophobic slander of immigrants, his casual calls to violence against political opponents—Trump had wona historic 81 percent of white evangelical voters. Yet that statistic was just a surface-level indicator of the foundational shifts taking place inside the Church. Polling showed that born-again Christian conservatives, once the president’s softest backers, were now his most unflinching advocates. Jessup had the same question as millions of other Americans: Why?As a believer in Jesus Christ—and as the son of an evangelical minister, raised in a conservative church in a conservative community—I had long struggled with how to answer this question. The truth is, I knew lots of Christians who, to varying degrees, supported the president, and there was no way to summarily describe their diverse attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. They were best understood as points plotted across a spectrum. At one end were the Christians who maintained their dignity while voting for Trump—people who were clear-eyed in understanding that backing a candidate, pragmatically and prudentially, need not lead to unconditionally promoting, empowering, and apologizing for that candidate. At the opposite end were the Christians who had jettisoned their credibility—people who embraced the charge of being reactionary hypocrites, still fuming about Bill Clinton’s character as they jumped at the chance to go slumming with a playboy turned president."
A Symbol of the Palestinian Resistance for the Internet Age,2018-01-05,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"Confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians are nearly as old as Israel’s military presence in the occupied territories itself. Confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian minors are not uncommon—one advocacy groupestimatedthat approximately 375 Palestinians between the ages of 12 and 17 were under Israeli military detention in 2016, often on charges of stone throwing.But for all the Palestinian youth who have had run-ins with the Israeli military, few have become as internet famous as Ahed Tamimi. The 16-year-old native of Nabi Saleh, a village in the West Bank, faced a dozen charges from Israeli authorities this week after a video of her slapping and kicking an Israeli soldier stationed outside her home spread across the web."
"Trump Leaves Israel Pushing Peace, but Staying Vague",2017-05-23,TheAtlantic,['Rosie Gray'],"JERUSALEM—Standing next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, Donald Trump declared that the Palestinians were ready for peace.“As I have repeatedly said, I am personally committed to helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a peace agreement, and I had a meeting this morning with President Abbas and can tell you that the Palestinians are ready to reach for peace,” said Trump, who met with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas earlier on Tuesday in Bethlehem. “I know you’ve heard it before. I am telling you—that’s what I do. They are ready to reach for peace.”Trump then gestured toward Netanyahu, sitting near him onstage, referring to him as “my good friend Benjamin” and saying that the Israeli leader, too, wanted peace.Trump has, to the surprise and gratification of many observers, shown seemingly genuine enthusiasm about negotiating a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But the Israel Museum speech capped off a full visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories in which Trump did not specifically refer to a two-state solution—which past administrations have taken for granted as the eventual result of peace talks—leaving the exact parameters of his “ultimate deal” unclear.On this issue at least, Trump faced a fair number of skeptics on Tuesday, even apart from Netanyahu himself. His audience for the speech included a who’s who of Israeli politics on the left and right—and some notables from the U.S. as well. Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam were in attendance, as was the former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.“Forming a second Palestinian state beyond the one in Gaza which is a failed terror state is no solution,” said Naftali Bennett, the leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, before the speech. “I certainly hope he doesn’t go down that path and until now he’s not indicated that he’s gonna go down that path.” Bennetthad hailedTrump’s election as “a tremendous opportunity for Israel to immediately announce its intention to renege on the idea of establishing Palestine in the heart of the country—a direct blow to our security and the justice of our cause.”"
To Die in the Time of Pestilence,2020-11-22,TheAtlantic,['Hisham Melhem'],"My wife, Rudaina, died at 9:30 p.m. on July 20. I was holding her hand.I have lost my parents and two siblings, but this was the first time I saw death come into a room and felt a life slip from my hand, ravaged by cancer. Minutes after, I kissed her forehead and was seized with fright and rage. “She is COLD,” I shrieked and collapsed on my knees with my head against her side. A nurse in her mid-20s knelt beside me, making the sounds mothers do to console a troubled child. I put my head on her shoulder.I stood over Rudaina’s bed for three hours, talking to her, weeping, moaning, and pleading with her to wake up. The nurse tried to answer my incoherent questions. I was confused, lost, and angry. More than four months later, I am still confused, lost, and angry, but I don’t know exactly what I’m angry at, or whom. Sometimes I want to raise my fist in the air and belt out a primitive howl to the universe."
How to Be Anti-Semitic and Get Away With It,2023-12-05,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"Out of 8 billion people on the planet, there are only 16 million Jews—but far, far more anti-Semites. I sometimes joke that if I had fewer scruples, I wouldn’t report on anti-Jewish prejudice; I’d contract myself out to the more numerous and better-resourced bigots, and help them get away with it. Because in more than a decade covering anti-Semitism, I have become a reluctant expert in all the ways that anti-Jewish activists obfuscate their hate.People must learn to recognize and reject these tactics, because too many communities have developed ways to excuse or otherwise ignore anti-Semitism. Today, such prejudice is growing in high and low places because powerful people around the world are running the same playbook to launder their hate into the public sphere.Here’s how they do it:1. They become too big to fail.Over the past six months, Elon Musk has publiclyaffirmedthe deadliest anti-Semitic conspiracy theory in recent American history,claimedthat Jews and Jewish organizations cause anti-Semitism, andechoedextremist conspiracy theories about the Jewish financier George Soros.As a result, the billionaire has lost a few advertisers on his social-media platform, and even gotrappedby the White House. But asTheNew York Timesreported, even as the U.S. government criticized Musk, it continued to buy things from him."
The Pre-Terrorists Among Us,2015-10-27,TheAtlantic,['Simon Cottee'],"Philip K. Dick’sThe Minority Reportis a short story about a dystopian future in which there are “no major crimes,” but a mass of imprisoned “would-be criminals.” This is thanks to “Precrime,” a criminal-justice agency whose preventive efforts are directed by a trio of mute oracles called “precog mutants.” The inherent and dark illiberalism of this approach is not lost on Precrime’s chief John Anderton, who concedes, “We’re taking in individuals who have broken no law.” Thefilm adaptationof the story wasdescribedby the film critic Peter Bradshaw as an “allegory for a hi-tech police state which bullies villains and law-abiding citizens alike with self-fulfilling prophecies of wrongdoing.”To a certain degree, the future Dick envisioned has already arrived. It comes in the form of “Countering Violent Extremism” (CVE), a set of “non-coercive” counterterrorism initiatives—embraced in the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere—aimed not only atde-radicalizingor disengaging convicted terrorists, but also at preventing “at risk” individuals from becomingterroristsin the first place.Unlike Precrime, CVE doesn’t license the mass imprisonment of would-be terrorists. But it does promote interventions that are intrusive and stigmatizing, targeting those who, to echo Anderton, have broken no law—but, as U.S. President Barack Obama recentlyput it, are “vulnerable ... to violent extremist ideologies.” British Prime Minister David Cameron struck a similar note in aspeechearlier this month, promising to introduce yet more measures in the United Kingdom totackleextremism“in all its forms,”including the “non-violent,” insisting that it was necessary to “stop this seed of hatred even being planted in people’s minds.”Who are the so-called extremists in our midst? They are everyone and no one, promiscuously crossing the gamut of social backgrounds and personality types. Among the membership of the numerous and varied terrorist groups in the world today, there are no usual suspects:men,women,teenagers,children,grandparents, as well as a whole kaleidoscope of exes:ex-punk rockers,ex-medical students,ex-gangbangers,ex-engineers,ex-rappers,ex-male models. And this is just from the jihadist spectrum. Who becomes a terrorist is anyone’s guess, althoughwhere you liveand who youare related to and knoware more salient factors thanhow you thinkandhow pooryou are."
The Constitutional Right to Boycott,2018-02-02,TheAtlantic,['Conor Friedersdorf'],"Esther Koontz is a public school educator in Wichita, Kansas. A couple years ago, she saw a presentation about Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. It struck her as unjust, and she wondered whether she should participate in the movement to boycott goods produced in Israel in hopes of pressuring it to change its policies. Then, last year, her church passed a resolution urging Mennonites like her to actively remedy injustice against both Palestinians and Israelis, in part by telling them “to avoid the purchase of products associated with acts of violence or policies of military occupation, including items produced in settlements.”That settled it: She would participate in the boycott.Around the same time, she decided to complete a Kansas State Department of Education training program that would qualify her to make some extra money by leading professional-development sessions for the state’s math and science teachers. Almost as soon as she completed the training, she was scheduled for her first gig. But before she started, she was contacted by Melissa Fast, the state employee who leads the program. There was a bit of paperwork she had to complete."
Israel’s Right-Wing Majority,2019-04-10,TheAtlantic,['Natan Sachs'],"If Israel holds elections in the year 2029, you might do well to bet on the right-wing Likud Party. Benjamin Netanyahu will probably no longer be prime minister by then—he faces an uphill battle to be prime ministera year from now, considering criminal charges are likely to be brought against him. On Wednesday morning, however, Bibi celebrated his fourth consecutive electoral victory and his fifth overall. He pulled through despite the pending criminal charges, despite a fairly unified opposition, and despite the many politicians fatigued by his tenure. The public as a whole does not appear to share that fatigue.Israel hasa multiparty system, and its elections can be inconclusive. But voters appear to have handed a clear victory to the right-wing parties that support Netanyahu, at least at the moment. Netanyahu will now move to form a coalition similar to his previous one, between his own enlarged Likud and other right-wing factions.This summer, Netanyahu will become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, surpassing the founding leader of the country, David Ben Gurion. At about the same time, his lawyers are scheduled to meet with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit to try to change the latter’s mind about indicting the prime minister for bribery and other charges in three criminal cases. Even while Netanyahu celebrates his victory among Israel’s 6 million eligible voters, his attention is squarely set on Mandelblit. Israel’s other politicians, meanwhile, are catching their breath from an ugly, whirlwind campaign, and coming to terms with the fact that they may need to campaign again before long, if Netanyahu is forced by his coalition partners to resign."
You Shouldn’t Be Afraid to Ask Questions,2022-02-17,TheAtlantic,[],
The End of Netanyahu,2023-10-22,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"Benjamin Netanyahu has always known what he wants his political epitaph to be. “I would like to be remembered as the protector of Israel,” hetoldthe journalist Fareed Zakaria in 2016. “That’s enough for me.” The longest-serving Israeli prime minister has repeated this refrain for more than a decade, inEnglishandHebrew. It is the core case he has made for himself to the Israeli people, part of a winning electoral argument begrudgingly credited even by some of his critics.You may not like me and you may not trust me, he would imply,but only I can keep you safe.“The ability to spot danger in advance and prepare for it is the test of a body’s functioning,” Netanyahu oncesaidon an Israeli talk show. “The Jewish nation has never excelled at foreseeing danger. We were surprised again and again—and the last time was the most awful one. That won’t happen under my leadership.” He concluded to applause: “This is what the state of Israel expects from me, and this is what I’ll do.”"
"Annexation, Apartheid, and Me",2020-07-03,TheAtlantic,['Hirsh Goodman'],"If Israel annexes part of the West Bank in early July and denies the Palestinians who come with it equal rights, I will confront one of the deepest dilemmas I have had to face since 1965, when I migrated to Israel from apartheid South Africa.I fought as an Israeli paratrooper in the Six Day War; was stationed in Sinai during the War of Attrition; spent nine months on the Golan Heights after fighting in the 1973 Yom Kippur War; and performed an average of 60 days of active reserve duty annually for about 15 years.I have lived with my family through Intifadas and suicide bombers, a succession of unnecessary wars, missile attacks from Iraq, and sporadic but persistent rocket and mortar barrages from over the border with Gaza.  My wife walked our four-year old to a birthday party shortly after a suicide bomber detonated himself. His head had landed on a balcony near the kindergarten and a grenade was found in the playground not far from the birthday cake."
Will Republicans Pay a Price for Extremism?,2023-10-26,TheAtlantic,['Ronald Brownstein'],"As president, Donald Trump imposed an array of deeply divisive immigration restrictions on both Latinos and Muslims. And yet from 2016 to 2020, he increased his share of the vote among both groups. Even some Latino and Muslim voters who opposed Trump’s immigration agenda moved to support him anyway because of his record on other issues, particularly the economy and conservative social priorities.Now Trump and several of his rivals for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination are doubling down on the bet that they can target each group with harsh immigration policies without paying an electoral price.For months, they have proposed an escalating succession of hard-line measures aimed at deterring mostly Latino undocumented migrants from crossing the southern border. And following the Hamas terror attack on Israel earlier this month, they rolled out a wave of exclusionary proposals aimed at Muslims. Trump has pledged that, if returned to the White House, he will restore his travel ban on people from a number of majority-Muslim nations, expand ideological screening of all potential immigrants to ensure that they agree with “our religion,” and deport foreign students in the United States who express hostility to Israel."
China’s Two-Faced Approach to Gaza,2023-11-04,TheAtlantic,['Michael Schuman'],"A new pattern is emerging in Chinese foreign policy that bodes poorly for global stability: Chinese leader Xi Jinping pretends to favor peaceful resolutions to international conflicts while actually encouraging the world’s most destabilizing forces.In the Middle East, Beijing has vociferously called for an end to the fighting between Israel and Hamas and claims to take an evenhanded approach to the belligerents. But the Chinese government is, in effect, backing Hamas—and therefore terrorism. Xi’s position on Gaza is identical to his stance on the world’s other major conflict, the war in Ukraine. There, too, Beijing has asserted principled neutrality and even launched a peace mission, while at the same time deepening ties to Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.Beijing seeks to exploit both of these crises in order to undermine the United States and promote its own global leadership. To this end, Xi backs the aggressor, blames the United States for the resulting disorder, and then portrays himself as the more responsible peacemaker with better solutions to the world’s problems. China and Russia are in this game together: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had the chutzpah to call for a cease-fire in Gaza indiscussionswith his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, while the Russian army was grinding up civilians in Ukraine."
Is Trump Walking Back the Israel Embassy Move?,2017-01-25,TheAtlantic,['Hussein Ibish'],"Late last week, an unconfirmed report by Israel’s Channel 2 newssuggestedthat President Donald Trump would soon announce the relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, delivering on apromisehe made repeatedly on the campaign trail. All of Jerusalem is claimed by Israel as its “eternal and undivided capital.” But the eastern part is considered by the international community to be occupied territory, and claimed by Palestinians as the capital of their own future state. Jerusalem is also sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims around the world. It has therefore been one of the most symbolically laden—and contested—places on earth for centuries.The White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, has since repeatedly emphasized that discussion about a possible move is in its very early stages, suggesting no announcement is imminent for now. But since the U.S. presidential election last November, those close to Trump have reaffirmed hisdeterminationtofollow through, leading many to conclude that the decision—considered by past presidents, but never implemented—had already been made, absent any major political coordination or laying of diplomatic groundwork. Should it happen in the near future, the timing would be strange: Moving the embassy is not a priority for even the Israeli far right, for whom issues such as expanding settlements are much more important. EvenAvigdor Lieberman, Israel’s hardline defense minister, dismissed the idea in December, perhaps recognizing that moving the embassy would almost certainly invite anoutpouring of violence."
The Syrian War Is Actually Many Wars,2018-04-14,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"The Middle East is a “troubled place,” President Donald Trump said Friday night as he described his decision to use America’s “righteous power” in a retaliatory attack against government targets in Syria following a suspected chemical attack there.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad seems to have won the civil war in his country—but that doesn’t mean peace is coming. In fact, the conflict seems to be escalating—fueled by the many outside powers who have joined the Syrian battlefield with interests of their own.“If you look at the literature on civil wars, it tends to suggest that the more foreign powers involved, the more difficult it is for a civil war to end—because most of those powers aren’t willing to quit until either they are exhausted or their claims and desires have been met,” said Christopher Phillips, author of the bookThe Battle for Syria: International Rivalryin the New Middle East.“And because a lot of them are backing proxies, the cost isn't necessarily that high.”"
This War Shows Just How Broken Social Media Has Become,2023-10-12,TheAtlantic,['Charlie Warzel'],"Social media has, once again, become the window through which the world is witnessing unspeakable violence and cruelty in an active war zone. Thousands of people, including children and the elderly, have been killed or injured in Israel and the Gaza Strip since Hamas launched its surprise attack on Saturday—you have probably seen the carnage yourself on X, TikTok, or Instagram.These scenes are no less appalling for their familiarity. But they are familiar. As my colleagueKaitlyn Tiffany wrote last year, the history of war is a history of media. The Gulf War demonstrated the power of CNN and the 24/7 cable-news format, foreshadowing the wayinfotainmentwould permeate politics and culture for the next 20 years. A series of contentious election cycles from 2008 to 2020, as well as the Arab Spring, the Syrian civil war, and the rise of the Islamic State, showed how social-media platforms democratized punditry and journalism, for better and worse. Commentators were quick to dub Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the “first TikTok war,” as the internet filled with videos from Ukrainians documenting the horrors of war in profoundly personal, often surreal ways.If such conflicts are lenses through which we can understand an information environment, then one must surmise that, at present, our information environment is broken. It relies on badly maintained social-media infrastructure and is presided over by billionaires who have given up on the premise that their platforms should inform users. During the first days of the Israel-Hamas war, X owner Elon Musk himself hasinteracted withdoctored videos published to his platform. He has also explicitlyendorsedaccounts that are known to share false information and express vile anti-Semitism. In an interview withThe New York Times, a Hamas officialsaidthat the organization has beenusing the lack of moderationon X to post violent, graphic videos on the platform to terrorize Israeli citizens. Meanwhile, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram and the unofficial lead on the company’s Twitter clone, Threads, has received requests from journalists, academics, and news junkies to make his product more useful for following the war. He has responded by saying that his team won’t “amplify” news media on the platform: “To do so would be too risky given the maturity of the platform, the downsides of over-promising, and the stakes,” hewrote. (Neither Meta nor X responded to requests for more information regarding their platforms’ plans to handle conflict-related posts.)"
What Conservatives Misunderstand About Radicalism at Universities,2023-10-18,TheAtlantic,['Tyler Austin Harper'],"Since William F. BuckleypublishedGod and Man at Yale—a best-selling book that criticized the “collectivist” sympathies of professors at Buckley’s alma mater—in 1951, conservatives have argued that prestigious American universities are hotbeds of dangerous Marxist brainwashing. Whether espoused by Buckley in the ’50s or by conservative firebrands today, the assertion that elite universities are sites of far-left indoctrination is and has always been a fantasy. The most popular major at Harvard, Yale, and many other supposedly leftist universities is economics—not exactly the subject of choice for aspiring anti-capitalists. At the University of Pennsylvania, 50 percent of graduating studentstake jobs in finance or consulting. The figures at other Ivies aren’t much lower. If these institutions are trying to produce Marxists, they are failing spectacularly.Yet conservatives are right when they say that the Ivory Tower is a breeding ground for ideological extremism. The politics on offer at elite universities are not leftist in any substantive sense—at least if by “leftist” you mean redistributive—but theyareradical. We might call it “corporate radicalism”: a political sensibility that blends what the late writer Mark Fisher derisively referred to as “capitalist realism”—the conviction that free-market neoliberalism is broken but that there is no better alternative so we might as well embrace it—with performative social justice that is as loud as it is toothless. Although academia has always been a haven for leftists, freethinkers, and creatives as well as crackpots, there used to be a kind of separation of church and state: Universities were refuges for radicals, but they were notthemselvesradical. (Consider the tensions between faculty and administrations during the campus protest movements of the 1960s.)"
Is Kushner Companies Taking Advantage of Its Connection to the President?,2017-05-09,TheAtlantic,['Jeremy Venook'],"It’s difficult to overstate just how unusual Jared Kushner’s role in the American government is. Since becoming asenior adviserto his father-in-law, President Donald Trump, the 36-year-old has—despite having no prior government experience—been put in charge ofan ever-expanding policy portfolio, ranging fromrestructuring the federal governmenttoresolving the conflicts between Israel and Palestinetoacting as the liaisonbetween the administration and the Chinese government.As with many members of Trump’s inner circle, Kushner oversees another portfolio, too. Just like his father-in-law, Kushner first rose to prominence as the heir toan international real-estate empire—and, just as the president’s insufficient efforts to distance himself from the Trump Organization has generateda long list of conflicts of interest,ethics expertshave expressed concern that Kushner’s ongoing relationship with his own family’s business will undermine his ability to carry out his duties.Of particular note in this regard have been the ties the family business, Kushner Companies, has to China, including apartnershipwith the Chinese state-owned bank Anbang on a building in Manhattan. Though that dealfell through in April, the underlying questions resurfaced over the weekend thanks to a pitch by Kushner’s sister in a Beijing ballroom. Speaking ata public event at a Ritz-Carlton hotel, Nicole Kushner Meyer stressed to attendees that, by buying into the family’s luxury apartment complex in New Jersey, investors would be able to fast-track their immigration to the United States."

This Is Not the Israel Trip Mike Pence Had Planned,2018-01-22,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"JERUSALEM—Mike Pence was greeted in Israel’s center of government on Monday in the way of a dear friend. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu beamed as he stood with the American vice president in his offices. “I have had the privilege over the years of standing here with hundreds of leaders and welcomed them, all of them, to Israel’s capital, Jerusalem,” he said. “This is the first time that I stand here where both leaders can say those three words: ‘Israel’s capital, Jerusalem.’”“It is my great honor, on behalf of the president of the United States, to be in Israel’s capital, Jerusalem,” Pence replied, similarly emphasizing the wordcapital. “But also, I look forward to speaking with you in detail about the opportunity for peace.” When President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and vowed to relocate the American embassy from Tel Aviv in December, he “did so convinced ... that we would create an opportunity to move on in good-faith negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority,” Pence said.The vice president may be in Israel trying to secure the peace that has eluded the country for well more than 70 years. But his visit underscores just how far Trump has moved the administration away from facilitating that future.During his speech to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, Pence reaffirmed the administration’s commitment to moving the American embassy, promising that it will open next year. But in the weeks since Trump made his initial announcement, leaders from across the Middle East have spoken fatalistically about the possibility of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. After Trump’s announcement, the head of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, publicly declared his refusal to meet with Pence. The vice president will skip his planned visit to Bethlehem and the West Bank, which was part of the originally scheduled December trip. And during Pence’s Monday speech at the Knesset, Arab members were roughly ushered out after raising signs in protest.The administration may have also undermined its own goals in the region. Originally, Pence’s trip was supposed to focus on Christian persecution,according toThe Washington Post.But influential religious leaders in Egypt—including Tawadros II, the Coptic patriarch, and Ahmed al-Tayeb, the head of Al-Azhar mosque—refusedtomeetwith him. Palestinian Christian leaders, including Munib Younan, the former head of the Lutheran World Federation, havespoken out againstthe vice president’s visit."

Why Activism Leads to So Much Bad Writing,2023-11-15,TheAtlantic,['George Packer'],"When artists turn to activismor introduce politics into a work of art, it’s usually taken as something virtuous, an act of conscience on behalf of justice. But artistic and political values are not the same; in some ways they’re opposed, and mixing them can corrupt both. Politics is almost never a choice between good and evil but rather between two evils, and anyone who engages in political action will end up with dirty hands, distorting the truth if not peddling propaganda; whereas an artist has to aspire to an intellectual and emotional honesty that will drive creative work away from any political line. Art that tries to give political satisfaction is unlikely to be very good as either politics or art.Last month, 92NY, a Jewish cultural center in New York, canceled a long-scheduled event with the novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen after he and 750 other writers and artists signed an open letter in theLondon Review of Bookscalling for “an end to the violence and destruction of Palestine.” The organizers insist that the event was only postponed, but that’s not how it looked. The cancellation was part of a wave of suppressed speech following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel: Pro-Palestinian student groups have been banned, speakers disinvited, and employees fired; aceremonyhonoring a Palestinian writer was canceled and an Islamicart exhibitwithdrawn; the only Palestinian American member of Congress wascensured. All of these acts are hostile to the values of free expression in a liberal democracy. So are boycotting Israeli individuals and institutions and ripping down pictures of Israeli hostages. Nguyen should have been heard, questioned, and challenged—not canceled."
Why Do So Few ISIS Fighters Come From the World's Largest Muslim Country?,2016-01-03,TheAtlantic,['Edward Delman'],"In recent days, rumblings of ISIS have reached the country with the largest Muslim population in the world. Security forces in Indonesia, which is home to some 200 million Muslims,launcheda manhunt for the militant leader Santoso, who had publicly pledged loyalty to the Islamic State. Policearrestedseveral suspected ISIS supporters amid chatter about terror plots, while Australia’s attorney-generalwarnedthat the Islamic State was intent on establishing a “distant caliphate” in the Southeast Asian island nation. But the flurry of activity doesn’t tell the whole story about ISIS’s inroads in Indonesia. Consider, for example, that while the number of foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS and other violent extremist groupsis estimatedto have more than doubled between June 2014 and December 2015, relatively few are coming from Indonesia—at least for now. The question is: Why?Indonesia has certainly experienced its share of terrorism and jihadist movements since declaring independence from the Netherlands in 1945. After proclaiming an “Islamic state” in 1949, the organizationDarul Islamdenounced the Indonesian state as apostate and staged a series of armed rebellions against it in the 1950s and early 1960s, before moving underground. The militant Islamist movement then split into numerous groups, fromLaskar Jihad, which led an anti-Christian campaign across Indonesia, toJemaah Islamiyah, which executed the2002 Bali bombings. Indonesian jihadists have not solely focused on local targets;manywent to Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion as mujahideen, though mostonly received trainingrather than engaging directly in the fighting there."
Photos: Evacuation of Gaza City,2023-10-16,TheAtlantic,[''],"The Israeli military hasrenewed its callfor civilians to evacuate northern Gaza as troops gather on the border in preparation for a widely anticipated ground invasion. The region is home to some 1.1 million people, and the United Nations haswarnedthat the evacuation order—foreshadowing further retaliation for the Hamas terrorist attacks that killed more than 1,300 people in Israel—will have “devastating” consequences. Hundreds of thousands of people have already left their homes, while medical workers caring for an influx of patients injured in earlier Israeli air strikes havecalledthe evacuation order “impossible.”"
Against Barbarism,2023-10-12,TheAtlantic,['Eliot A. Cohen'],"There is a place for geopolitical and strategic analysis of Israel’s war with Hamas and its allies and associates—how it affects politics in the Gulf, whether it will reduce American aid to Ukraine, how Russia may exploit the situation, and so forth. But such discussion will miss an essential element of this war, a conflict that is not solely, or even primarily, about politics or desperately conceived purpose. It is about barbarism.Americans have fought barbarians in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Ukrainians have been fighting them for years, and particularly since February 24, 2022. Sometimes, as in Rwanda, we merely note them with embarrassment and eyes averted. Other times, as during the massacre at Srebrenica committed by Serbian forces, we flinch, and act belatedly and inadequately. We express pity for the dead, but often fail to fight for the living.Barbarians fight because they enjoy violence. They do not only kill and maim—the armies of civilized states do that all the time—but go out of their way to inflict pain, to torture, to rape, and above all to humiliate. They exult in their enemies’ suffering. That is why they like taking pictures of their weeping, terrified victims; why they make videos of slow beheadings; and why they dance around mutilated corpses."
An Israel 'Conspiracy Theory' That Proved True—but Also More Complicated,2018-04-27,TheAtlantic,['Neri Zilber'],"To report on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is to invite criticism and controversy.  In what is arguably the most well-covered story in the world (perhaps before the rise of Trump), any mistake is amplified, with both sides often accusing media outlets and journalists of bias. YetThe New York Timesrecently took this journalistic truth to another level with a severely unforced error. In a wholly unrelated profile on Facebook’s Campbell Brown, the Grey Lady was forced to issue a long correction due to a throwaway line touting “Palestinians Pay $400 million Pensions For Terrorist Families” as an example of “far-right conspiracy programming” peddled on the social network.In fact, as theTimessubsequentlyclarified, “Palestinian officials have acknowledged providing payments to the families of Palestinians killed while carrying out attacks on Israelis or convicted of terrorist acts and imprisoned in Israel; that is not a conspiracy theory.”Such payments, in truth, have risen to the top of the policy agenda in Washington over the past year. The omnibus spending package passed in March by Congressincluded a billcalled the Taylor Force Act, which cuts U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority (PA) until the practice of paying imprisoned terrorists and the families of dead terrorists is ended. (Taylor Force was a U.S. army veteran who was killed in a Palestinian attack in Israel in 2016.) The Israeli government, as well, has long called for such a measure and has debatedpassing a comparable billin the Knesset. As President Donald Trumpsaid on his visitto the West Bank last May, “Peace can never take root in an environment where violence is tolerated, funded, and even rewarded.”"
Inside Gaza’s Last Catholic Parish,2023-10-14,TheAtlantic,['Claire Porter Robbins'],"It’s just past 1 a.m. on October 12, the fourth day of Israel’s assault on Gaza, and my friend Rami is awake, texting me from a pew in the Holy Family Church in Gaza City, where he and his family are sheltering from air strikes.He tells me their apartment building was hit last night, their home completely demolished. Now he, his wife, and their two kids are sleeping on mattresses in the church hall, alongside almost 200 other Gazans evacuated or displaced from their homes. Because Rami fears for his safety, I’m using only his first name here.There are about 40 kids in the church, Rami says, and the adults are trying to keep them busy and distracted even as the sounds of rockets rattle the building. They’ve been playing soccer in the hall, because going outside is not an option. The adults have been praying, he says, and checking their phones for more news. He wants to come up with an activity for tomorrow that would entertain the kids without using power, but he’s too tired and anxious to think right now. More soccer, he supposes. Another 500 adults and children are taking refuge at the orphanage on the church property, and at a Catholic school not too far away. But going between them is dangerous."
The One-State Delusion,2023-11-15,TheAtlantic,['Arash Azizi'],"A Nepalese historian once told me a story. On a plane to Kathmandu, he was sitting next to an American legal expert who had been called in to help design Nepal’s first-ever republican constitution. But after sparking a conversation about Nepal’s history and its diverse peoples, the historian was shocked at the expert’s lack of knowledge about the country. The American was quick to explain that this ignorance was deliberate, and that he had no desire to learn about Nepal. “You see, good constitutional law is good regardless of the context,” the expert said. “I make a point of not learning details about a country, because they are irrelevant to constitutional design.”This case might be extreme, or perhaps embellished in the retelling, but something about it feels terribly familiar in regard to the Middle East. Americans debating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict often resort to simple categories and narratives, seeking to impose them without regard to context. One such narrative ignores the history of nationalism and the national right to self-determination. Israel, by this account, is uniquely evil because it is an ethno-nationalist state, and thus the only acceptable solution is for all the land between the (Jordan) river and the (Mediterranean) sea to be part of “one secular democratic state,” presumably without an ethno-national reference, similar to the United States."
Harvard Has a Brand Problem. Here’s How to Fix It.,2023-11-21,TheAtlantic,['David Frum'],"Ethically and academically, 2023 has been a bad year for America’s most richly endowed university. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Harvard discriminated against Asian applicants. Major donors have mutinied after anti-Semitic incidents on campus. Can Harvard be saved? Here, I imagine some guidance from the university’s investment advisers.Dear Board of Overseers,Harvard has been described as a hedge fund with a university attached. This is the literal truth.As endowment-fund managers, our core business is accumulating and growing enormous sums of our clients’ money: in Harvard’s case, $50 billion and rising.

That’s why being connected to a wealthy donorenhancesan applicant’s chance of admission to Harvard by a factor of nine."
Don’t Expect U.S.-China Relations to Get Better,2023-11-16,TheAtlantic,['Michael Schuman'],"By meeting President Joe Biden in San Francisco yesterday, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, made a tacit, and probably uncomfortable, admission that China still needs the United States, whether he likes it or not. That’s why the summit will likely reinforce his intent to overthrow American global power.For now, the meeting was a win for Biden and his China policy. Biden’s foreign-policy team has argued that the United States can both compete and, at times, cooperate with China, while stressing that continued communication can prevent relations from descending into confrontation. This approach has often appeared overly optimistic: The two sides have continually sparred over Taiwan, technology, and human rights, and dialogue has frequently broken down.The fact that the two men met at all is evidence that Biden’s strategy might have merit. Even better, Biden won some tangible (though minor) benefits. Xi agreed to restore a military dialogue with Washington and to help curb the illicit export from China of chemicals used to make fentanyl. Biden may even get a fewpandasin the deal, as Xi indicated his willingness to once again send the rare bears to American zoos as existing agreements expire."
A New Word Is Defining the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict in Washington,2021-05-21,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"In a conflict where words matter (so much so that even using the wordconflictinvites disagreement), it’s notable when the words used begin to change. And when it comes to discussing Israel and Palestine in the United States, the words have changed. The first, most obvious shift has come from Congress, where more and more (predominantly progressive) voices have criticized Israel’s human-rights abuses, as well as the U.S. government’s role in sustaining a status quo that human-rights groups and other high-profile leaders, including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, havelikenedto apartheid. Staunch defenders of Israel within the Democratic Party nowoffercriticismof the scale of the country’s military response in Gaza (which causedextensive damage, and at least 230 deaths) or, just as strikingly,say nothingat all.But a subtle, and perhaps more revealing, shift has come from the White House itself. In an address announcing yesterday’s cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, President Joe Bidensaid, “Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy.” Areadoutfrom a call between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Israeli counterpart echoed those words almost verbatim, as didremarksby White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki."
The Many Ways Iran Could Target the United States,2019-05-06,TheAtlantic,"['Kathy Gilsinan, Krishnadev Calamur']","“The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime,” National Security Adviser John Bolton said in a Sunday-night statement announcing that U.S. warships were headed to the Middle East. But “any attack on United States interests or those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.”In the year since President Donald Trump left the Iran nuclear deal, his administration has steadily ratcheted up economic pressure against the Iranian regime, deploying anunprecedented number of sanctionsto throttle its oil exports and punish its support for regional proxies. With Sunday’s announcement, though, Bolton invoked unspecified Iranian threats to the U.S. and its regional allies, while hinting at a more serious step: the threat of violence.Bolton’s announcement could ultimately represent just that: a threat. But the announcement fit the harsh tone of an administration that has repeatedly demanded behavior change from Iran and condemned its regional activities, support for terrorists, and nuclear-weapons ambitions. It also fit a pattern of bellicose rhetoric from an administration fond of invoking “all options” to scare rivals into backing down. The pattern has shown up in North Korea and Venezuela, where neither policy change nor military strikes has yet resulted. But when it comes to Iran especially, it’s anyone’s guess when exactly the bluster will become reality."
The Book That Never Stops Changing,2022-06-16,TheAtlantic,['Fintan O’Toole'],"When I was a kid, the axis around which Dublin revolved was a huge Doric column thathad stood at the center of the city since 1809. On the top was a statue of the English naval hero Vice Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson. Even to a child, his presence seemed anomalous. It was as if Washington, D.C., were dominated by a giant memorial to King George III.One day, when I was 8 years old, my father and his cousin Vincent led me and my brother up the168 stepsthat wound through the hollow interior of the monument we Dubliners called Nelson’s Pillar. I had never before seen the city from a vantage point so high that you could take in the whole place, the bay to the outlying mountains.But there was, for me, an edge of unease. Vincent had bought half a dozen plums in a fruit shop. When we got to the top of the pillar, he opened the brown paper bag and gave us each one. He and my father started laughing about how they could spit the stones down on the people below. I found this deeply unsettling because I did not know my father could be like that, that he could joke about something I was sure would get us into big trouble. It was also darkly mysterious. The adults clearly thought there was some meaning in all of this—but what did plums have to do with Nelson?More than a decade later, I found out. I was reading, for the first time, James Joyce’sUlysses. The centenary of the novel’s publication is being marked in Dublin with official enthusiasm climaxing on Bloomsday, June 16.But back then it was still—as it should be—a thrillingly strange and dirty book, full of provocations and subversions. I came to an episode in which the author’s alter ego, Stephen Dedalus, is passing Nelson’s Pillar with some other men. He tries to impress them with a story about two middle-aged Dublin women who save their money for a day out. They buy a lot of plums and climb the pillar. Then “they put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.”"

Everything About the Ukraine Leak Is Incredibly Weird,2023-04-12,TheAtlantic,['Amy Zegart'],"A recent U.S. intelligence leak is already shaping up to beone of the most damaging breaches in years, revealinghighly sensitive informationabout the war in Ukraine, Israeli domestic politics, America’s deep penetration of high-level Russian military plans and operations, and more. By last count, approximately 100 pages ofclassified slides and briefing materials from the Pentagonhave been discovered floating around the internet. Many pages included intelligence that is stunning in its timeliness. Some materials were marked “top secret.” Most areconsidered genuine. The Justice Department haslaunched a criminal investigation, furious military leaders arereviewing how the Pentagon handles classified information, and an interagency task force isscrambling to assesswhether the damage is a bad nightmare or a really bad nightmare.Big breaches are nothing new. Chelsea Manning, then an Army intelligence analyst, handed over hundreds of thousands of classified documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks. The former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden stole an estimated 1.5 million documents containing information about some of the most highly classified intelligence programs in the U.S. government. Another NSA contractor, Hal Martin,pleaded guilty to willful hoarding of national-defense informationafter being accused of stashing perhaps 500 million pages of secrets in his house, car, and garden shed."
Who Gets to Claim Kafka?,2018-08-09,TheAtlantic,['Adam Kirsch'],"An admirer of Franz Kafka’sonce presented him with a specially bound volume of three of his stories. Kafka’s reaction was vehement: “My scribbling … is nothing more than my own materialization of horror,” he replied. “It shouldn’t be printed at all. It should be burnt.” At the same time, Kafka believed that he had no purpose in life other than writing: “I am made of literature,” he said, “and cannot be anything else.” Clearly, Kafka’s ambivalence about his work was an expression of deep uncertainty about himself. Did he have the right to inflict his dreadful imaginative visions on the world? “If one can give no help one should remain silent,” he mused. “No one should let his own hopelessness cause the patient’s condition to deteriorate.”Ironically, the hopelessness of Kafka’s work was precisely what ensured its place atthe center of 20th-century literature. Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning to discover that he has been transformed into an insect, and Joseph K., who is put on trial by an unofficial court for a crime no one will explain to him, have become archetypal modern figures. W. H. Auden proposed that Kafka was to the alienated, absurd 20th century what Dante or Shakespeare had been to their times—the writer who captured the essence of the age."
Hezbollah Watches and Waits,2023-10-18,TheAtlantic,['Kim Ghattas'],"Villagers in southern Lebanon have been heading north, fearing all-out war. Most schools are closed. Israel has ordered its citizens to vacate 28 towns along the border with Lebanon. The Israeli army has exchanged fire with Hezbollah—Lebanon’s Shia political and paramilitary group—every day since October 7, resulting in casualties on both sides. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said, “We must respond to what is happening in Gaza”; its foreign minister, Amir Abdollahian, warned of apreemptivestrike by Iran’s allies against Israel.And yet, 12 days after the Hamas attack on Israel, the man who holds some of the cards and usually sets the tone, Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, is still silent—no speeches, no interviews. For someone who loves to give fiery addresses to his followers and does so regularly, Nasrallah’s reticence is notable and can mean only one thing.Hezbollah is keeping its powder (mostly) dry while Iran weighs its options and their possible outcomes. Israel has called up 300,000 reservists, the United States has sent two carrier strike groups to the Mediterranean, and President Joe Biden headed to the region with one word for Hezbollah: “Don’t.” For Tehran, regime survival trumps all considerations—and it requires the survival of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Islamic Republic’s most valuable asset and a key line of its defense. Every Israeli strike on Gaza, every mass-casualty event, will factor into the calculation as both Iran and Hezbollah assess their next moves."
The Qatar Crisis Is Pushing Hamas Back to Iran,2017-06-14,TheAtlantic,['Gregg Carlstrom'],"BEIRUT — Three years after the last war in Gaza, the leaders of Israel and Palestine seem to be lurching toward another round of fighting—although not for the reasons you may think.On Sunday, the Israeli security cabinetagreed, at the request of the Palestinian president, to reduce the amount of electricity it supplies to the blockaded territory by 40 percent. The officials came to the decision even after top Israeli generals warned it would lead to a humanitarian crisis in the strip, where 1.9 million people are bracing for a scorching summer with perhaps only three hours of power per day. Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls Gaza, warned of an “explosion.”Blackouts are not the only issue, however: If there is a fresh round of fighting, it may be sparked by a diplomatic crisis happening some 1,100 miles away—one that both the Israeli defense minister and U.S. President Donald Trump have goaded on.On June 5, Saudi Arabia and several of its allies decided, with little warning, to blockade Qatar, in an effort to punish the tiny emirate of 2.7 million residents for supporting the wrong groups across the region—namely the Muslim Brotherhood—and to reinforce an alliance against Riyadh’s real nemesis: Iran. There are already signs that the effort may backfire. Turkey has doubled down on ties with Qatar,fast-tracking a billthat allows it to deploy troops there. Iran rushed to establish an air bridge to Doha,flying in shipmentsof food.There is, of course, ample reason to criticize Qatar’s role in the region. The emirate has reportedly paid hefty ransoms to al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, and looked the other way as private citizens funneled millions to jihadists across the Middle East. Al Jazeera’s Arabic service, once the boldest news channel in the area, has degenerated into a sort of propaganda outlet for Sunni Islamists, peddlingconspiracy theoriesand sectarian vitriol about Christians in Egypt,Alawites in Syria, and other groups.But all this hardly begins to explain this region’s fraught politics. For all the talk of brotherly unity, the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council is a dysfunctional, divided alliance. Saudi Arabia tries to set the tone: It is larger than the other five members of the council, combined, and draws diplomatic and religious clout from its custodianship of the holy sites in Mecca and Medina. Its main fear is Iran, followed by political Islam."
The Myths About 1967 That Just Won't Die,2017-06-02,TheAtlantic,['Aaron David Miller'],"The Arab-Israeli war that took place in June of 1967 was undeniably a major watershed in modern Middle Eastern history and a fundamental inflection point in the Arab-Israeli conflict. In conquering the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan, and east Jerusalem, Israel created new and enduring realities that would frame the pursuit of peace and the waging of wars for the next half century. For Palestinians, the experience would be particularly bitter.At the same time, the notion that the proverbial six days of war created a figurative Seventh Day—a kind of dark shadow under which the Arab-Israeli conflict has played out, inexorably and depressingly, these many years—is too simplistic a read.The war created its fair share of crises, to be sure. But it also generated opportunities and a new, more pragmatic dynamic among the Arab states and Palestinians, which at least partially reversed the results of the war itself and transformed much of the Arab-Israeli arena.With this in mind, here are some myths about the war’s centrality and impact that need to be reexamined.“The 1967 war was the most consequential and impactful of the conflicts between Israel and the Arabs.”Not so fast. Clearly the 1967 war has a contemporary media, political, and commemorative profile higher than that of any other Arab-Israeli war. The stunning speed of Israel’s military victory; the sheer magnitude of the Arab defeat; the conquest of Jerusalem; the enduring nature of the Israeli occupation and the settlement enterprise—all these things guaranteed that high profile.Still, a compelling argument can be made that the 1948 conflict was more foundational, creating as it did the state of Israel, the Palestinian refugee problem, and a political revolution in Arab politics that would see various coups and revolutions. And it is the “1948 identity issues”—refugees and acceptance of a Jewish state—that remain to this day among the most intractable issues in the negotiations."
"All My Life, I’ve Watched Violence Fail the Palestinian Cause",2023-11-08,TheAtlantic,['John Aziz'],"My father was one of 10 siblings from a rural village in the West Bank. As a 6-year-old, he hid with his family in a cave during the Six-Day War, the start of 16 years spent under military occupation. Once, when my father was passing through a checkpoint as an undergraduate, a soldier noticed an astrophysics textbook under his arm. He told my father that Arabs were too stupid for the subject, but that only hardened his resolve to keep learning. By the time he met my English mother, he was in America studying for a Ph.D.I grew up between two worlds, spending most of my life in England, and most of my summers immersed in Palestinian culture with my family in California.In my father’s home, we atemaqluba, a cinnamon-infused upside-down chicken, vegetable, and rice dish. We drank Arabic coffee—thick and black and mixed with cardamom. We talked in a jumbled hybrid of Arabic and English, starting a sentence in one language and finishing in the other. I read Mahmoud Darwish and Edward Said. We got our news from Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. My best instrument was the electric guitar, but I could also play thedarbouka, a goblet drum, as well as theoud, a kind of lute. I mixed Arabic sounds with Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd."
Is There More to Conservatism Than Mocking ‘Wokeness’ on YouTube?,2023-11-08,TheAtlantic,['Helen Lewis'],"Updated at 11:00 a.m. ET on November 9, 2023During the 1980s, the area of southeast London known as Canary Wharf was transformed from a shabby industrial wasteland into a peninsula of silver towers, tall enough to reach the clouds. This was the promise of Margaret Thatcher–era conservatism, written in glass and concrete: tearing up the old to liberate the new, unleashing the free market to increase prosperity and productivity.Today, Canary Wharf is still gleaming, still rich. But it’s also soulless. Wide, empty streets run between the towers, with none of the haphazard, organic exuberance of London’s old neighborhoods. Appropriately enough, this was the view that greeted delegates to the inaugural ARC Forum, held last week at Magazine London, a convention center on the opposite bank of the Thames. The acronym stands for Alliance for Responsible Citizenship, an international group of politicians, thinkers, and influencerswho“do not believe that humanity is necessarily and inevitably teetering on the brink of apocalyptic disaster.” That statement could reflect a gathering devoted to finding an uplifting vision of the future—or it could be code for climate-change denialism. Hold on to that ambiguity."
A 'Catastrophe' That Defines Palestinian Identity,2018-05-14,TheAtlantic,['Hussein Ibish'],"Violence is intensifying in Gaza as the United States opens its new embassy in Jerusalem, a convergence of current politics and long-simmering tensions in the region. Israeli forces opened fire on demonstrators, killing dozens and wounding hundreds more, Palestinian officials said.May 14 marks the 70th anniversary of Israel’s founding; May 15 is a day Palestinians know as theirnakba, or “catastrophe,” the traumatic expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in 1948 by Israelis. This event both defined their future of statelessness and occupation, and now forms the basis for their distinct national identity. Many of the chief consequences of thenakba, including the displacement of most Palestinians from their ancestral lands and ongoing statelessness, remain unresolved to this day.This helps explain the enduring violence between Israelis and Palestinians, which flared up most recently on the border with Gaza. Beginning on March 30, a series of Friday protests billed the “Great March of Return” have seen thousands of mainly unarmed young men confront Israeli forces and border guards. They are blocking these men from the nearby villages, located in what is now Israel, from which many of their families were displaced in the 1940s. At least 37 protesters have died, and over 4,000 injured, in the unrest. These demonstrations, which will culminate on the 15th, combined with the opening of a U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, may well become yet another historic flashpoint. And even if the worst does not come to pass this time, sooner or later, it will. Until we come to grips with the political and cultural legacy of thenakba, calm, stability, and normality will elude Israel and the rest of the Middle East."
What Happens When the U.S. Overestimates Its Power,2023-12-02,TheAtlantic,['Phillips Payson O’Brien'],"Ever since a terror attack by Hamas triggered a war in Israel and Gaza in October, many commentators have presumed that the United States can in some way manage the course of the crisis—either by supporting Israel emphatically or by demanding greater restraint from that country’s leaders. Successive American administrations, including Joe Biden’s, have encouraged this belief in American control of events in the Middle East and around the world. Just days before the Hamas attack, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan boasted in an article in aForeign Affairsarticle that the Biden administration had “de-escalated crises in Gaza.” The Middle East, he wrote, is “quieter than it has been for decades,” echoingcomments he made at The Atlantic Festivalin late September. (The online version of the article was subsequently edited to omit those statements.) In essence, the United States had mistaken a temporary lull in the Middle East for a more enduring period of relative peace—and ascribed the apparent boon to American influence.The lesson the United States should be drawing is that it generally cannot enforce its will—however benevolent Americans believe it to be—in every area of the world. In region after region, the United States engages with movements and governments that are powerful actors themselves. Some will at least outwardly genuflect to the U.S., but all of them will pursue their own interests. In overestimating their own power, American presidents risk worse outcomes, both for the United States and for the causes it is trying to promote."
‘We’re Going to Die Here’,2023-10-09,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"When I first heard that Israeli civilians were being massacred on the country’s Gaza border, I thought of my friend Amir Tibon. Amir is an exceptionally talented journalist who is fluent in Hebrew, Arabic, and English, and who has devoted his life and skills to humanistic coverage of what can often be a dehumanizing region. His writing includesaward-winning reportingon efforts to achieve a two-state solution and abiographyof Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.On Sunday, I didn’t know whether he was alive or dead.That’s because Tibon lives in Nahal Oz, a small community bordering Gaza that has no Iron Dome missile defense to protect it. On Saturday, it came under mortar fire from above and was invaded on the ground by Hamas terrorists. During their incursion into Israel, they murdered more than 900 Israelis while brutalizing and kidnapping many others, most of them civilians. The death toll is continuing to rise."
Israel Is Walking Into a Trap,2023-10-13,TheAtlantic,['Hussein Ibish'],"It’s a trap. Hamas’s ruthless and spectacular attack on southern Israel last Saturday was many things: an atrocity, a display of militant ingenuity, and a demonstration of the weakness of Israeli intelligence and defenses. Israel and the Palestinians have a long history of brutality against each other, but the Hamas killing spree outdoes anything since Israeli-controlled Christian militias massacred unarmed Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps outside of Beirut in 1982. It may even have been the single most brutal act by either side in the 100-year-old conflict. But above all, it was intended as a trap—one that Israel appears about to fall into.Hamas’s leaders and their Iranian backers have a conscious strategy. Like almost all other acts of spectacularly bloodthirsty terrorism, Hamas’s assault on southern Israel was designed to provoke an emotional and equally or even more outrageous response by the targeted society. Hamas and Iran are attempting to goad the Israelis into Gaza for a prolonged confrontation—which is to say that the intended effect is precisely the ground assault Israel is now preparing in order to root out and destroy Hamas as an organization, kill its cadres and leadership, and destroy as much of its infrastructure and equipment as possible."
Trump Delivers a Victory to Iran,2018-12-24,TheAtlantic,"['Reuel Marc Gerecht, Mark Dubowitz']","During the presidential campaign, the outlier in Donald Trump’s foreign-policy orations was his treatment of Iran. On Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia (remember President Barack Obama’s “off-mic” tête-à-tête with President Dmitry Medvedev?), and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Trump largely followed his predecessor. Differences existed, certainly in style and manner, but the overlap between the two men on most of the big foreign-policy questions was profound.When it came to the clerical regime in Iran, however, the two men were polar opposites. Trump thought the nuclear agreement with Iran, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was “the worst deal ever.” He also let loose against Tehran’s Islamic radicalism, terrorism, quest for regional hegemony, and fondness for sowing mayhem in the Middle East. Trump’s serrated rhetoric stood in contrast to the comments of Obama, his secretary of state, and other senior officials, who had muted their criticisms of Tehran in their pursuit of the atomic accord and, as important, a new strategic realignment, wherein a less interventionist America might, so the theory went, find a modus vivendi with a richer, commercially engaged, and moderating Islamic Republic.As president, Trump followed through. The nuclear deal went down, the sanctions came back, and despite moments of wobbliness concerning troop deployments in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, the Trump administration held fast in the Middle East. National-Security Advisers H. R. McMaster and John Bolton, United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, and, perhaps most of all, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid out a new approach to the Islamic Republic. The Trump administration wasn’t inclined to roll back the clerical regime, but it did seem ready to contest and contain Iran’s Shiite imperialism in Syria, Yemen, and even in Iraq, in which the president had never evinced much interest."
Photos: Dire Conditions in Gaza,2023-10-12,TheAtlantic,[''],"Israel continues to hit Gaza with air strikes in retaliation for Hamas’s surprise attack that has so far killed 1,300 people in Israel and wounded thousands more. An additional 1,400 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.Gaza is facing a “huge” humanitarian crisis, one United Nations officialtoldThe New York Times, as Israel has cut off electricity to the region, and hospitals there are running out of the fuel necessary to keep generators running. Food and water in the region are also quickly running out, the UN’s World Food Programwarned. And as Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Israel today to underscore the United States’ unequivocal support for Israel, he also said that “it’s important to take every possible precaution to prevent harming civilians.”Meanwhile, Hamas is holding hostage at least 150 civilians captured in the attack on Israel, including children and elderly people. Officials in Israel believe the hostages are being held inside Gaza’s network of underground cellars and tunnels, where they could still be harmed by Israel’s air strikes on Gaza. “This is without question the most difficult hostage situation Israel has ever faced in its history,” Michael Milstein, a senior analyst at the Institute for Policy and Strategy at Israel’s Reichman University,toldthe BBC."
Israeli Democracy Faces a Mortal Threat,2023-03-22,TheAtlantic,['David Grossman'],"Israel now finds itself in one of the gravest crises it has ever known. Even after the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the dangers the country faced were less tangible: In November 1995, it was clear that a new prime minister would be instated in a lawful, orderly transition. The situation now is different. Three of the Israeli Parliament’s most extremist, nationalistic members—Minister of Justice Yariv Levin; Constitution, Law and Justice Committee Chair Simcha Rothman; and Benjamin Netanyahu, the near-omnipotent prime minister—are acting with all their might and no qualms to create a new legal system in place of the present one, which they claim discriminates against them and does not represent their worldview or values.Legally, they are within their rights: In Israel’s most recent election, last November, the parties that now form the ruling coalition came out four members ahead in the 120-member Knesset. But they are employing a rushed and belligerent procedure that is unprecedented in Israel. Their objective is to enact not only a series of changes to the extant system, but a total alteration of the country’s DNA."
Jeremy Corbyn’s Ironically Ahistorical Anti-Semitism,2018-08-28,TheAtlantic,['Deborah Lipstadt'],"The past two years have brought a seemingly unending stream ofrevelations about disparaging commentsmade by the British Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, about Jews, Zionists, and Israel. But in recent days has come the lowest blow, with the emergence of a video from 2013. Corbyn, in speaking of people who approached the Palestine Liberation Organization representative to the United Kingdom to challenge points he had made in a talk,declaredthat such Zionists “clearly have two problems. One is that they don’t want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don’t understand English irony, either.”Corbyn may have said “Zionists” and not “Jews,” but listening to the speech, the two seemed interchangeable. It wasn’t their ideology he attacked, but what he deemed their lack of Englishness—that “Zionists” might live in Britain for a very long time, even all their lives, and still remain alien, unable to grasp either history or irony. For this Jew, this was a cut to the quick. For what is it but a sense of history and irony that has sustained Jews through the vicissitudes of their collective experience?"
"Celebration in Jerusalem, Bloodshed in Gaza",2018-05-14,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"JERUSALEM—The signs are plastered all over the city, on buses and street lamps and buildings and thoroughfares:Trump Make Israel GreatandTrump Is A Friend of Zion.These messages, celebrating the opening of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, however, are somewhat misleading. Although they may look like Israeli praise for President Donald Trump and his decision to move the facility from Tel Aviv, they’re actually produced by an American evangelical Christian organization called the Friends of Zion Museum. The signs stand proudly along the winding streets of hilly Jerusalem, overlooking Palestinian neighborhoods in the valley below—a perfect metaphor for the divide between one group’s celebration and another group’s mourning. “Congratulations,” Trump said in a video message at the opening ceremony. “It’s been a long time coming.”And yet, the embassy opened on Monday amid historic, bloody protests in Gaza, where thousands have been injured in weeks of demonstrations along the border fence. By the time U.S. Ambassador David Friedman took the stage on Monday, the Gaza Health Ministrywas reportingsome three dozen people killed by Israeli forces in protests and nearly 1,000 wounded. The celebration in Jerusalem—a victory claimed by both American Christian and Jewish groups—was a disorienting contrast to the violence in Palestinian territories. Despite calls for peace by Israeli and American officials at the ceremony on Monday, the moment signaled the difficulty of any kind of resolution ahead."
What the Ben &amp; Jerry’s Decision Reveals About Israel,2021-07-23,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"No company does progressive politics quite like Ben & Jerry’s. The Vermont-based ice-cream maker has a reputation forcorporate activism, owing to its support for a wide array of left-wing causes, including marriage equality, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter. But when the companyannouncedthis week that it will no longer sell its products in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, it faced an outcome that every ice-cream maker fears most: a meltdown.The matter of Israel’s settlements, which the international community regards as illegal under international law but which the Trump administration said will need to be resolved through a political and not a judicial process, has long been a thorny issue in Israel. (The Biden administration has yet to articulate its own policy on this.) When it comes to ice cream, though, the country’s notoriously fractious political sphere is virtually unanimous. Israel’s right-wing prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said that Ben & Jerry’s has decided to brand itself as an “anti-Israel ice cream.” His centrist coalition partner, Yair Lapid, called the move a “shameful surrender to anti-Semitism.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog of the center-left, who oncecommitted to removingIsraeli settlements in the West Bank, called Ben & Jerry’s decision to shun them “a new kind of terrorism.” The newly minted opposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu,suggestedthat Israelis should boycott the brand. One centrist cabinet minister dutifully posteda TikTokof herself chucking a pint of what looked like Dulce de Leche into the trash.That an ice-cream maker could cause such an uproar at the highest levels of Israeli politics says a lot about how sensitive Israel is to the very notion of boycotts against it—even those that, like Ben & Jerry’s, are limited in scope. More fundamentally, the dustup reveals a growing divergence between how the world sees Israel and how the country sees itself. While the international community, including the United States, continues to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies, the reaction to the Ben & Jerry’s decision has shown that, as far as many Israeli politicians are concerned, that distinction no longer exists."
‘The Middle East Region Is Quieter Today Than It Has Been in Two Decades’,2023-10-07,TheAtlantic,['Gal Beckerman'],"Updated at 3:12 p.m. ET on October 7, 2023What a difference a week makes.Just eight days ago, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking at The Atlantic Festival, rattled off a long list of positive developments in the Middle East, developments that were allowing the Biden administration to focus on other regions and other problems. A truce was holding in Yemen. Iranian attacks against U.S. forces had stopped. America’s presence in Iraq was “stable.” The good news crescendoed with this statement: “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.”One week later, a shocking, multifront attack launched by the Iranian-supported Hamas against Israel has turned the Middle East into a maelstrom. The assault, almost 50 years to the day after the surprise Arab attack on Israel that marked the opening of the Yom Kippur War, could represent a paradigm-shifting moment as big as 9/11. So far, more than 100 Israelis are confirmed dead and many hundreds more gravely injured in a coordinated attack by Hamas terrorists who infiltrated by land, sea, and air. A thousand tragedies will unfold—at the moment, an unknown number of Israeli civilians and soldiers might be held hostage in Gaza. As of this writing, nearly 200 are reported dead in Israeli reprisal raids. The Israeli army has activated at least 100,000 reservists, and a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza is plausible, if not probable."
Why Extremists Need Therapy,2020-02-11,TheAtlantic,['Helen Lewis'],"How do you unmake a terrorist? It’s an urgent question, particularly for Britain. About220 peopleare in prison for terror offenses in the country, the majority of whom are Islamists. Until recently, 20-year-old Sudesh Amman was one of them. He was released in January after serving half of a three-year sentence for possessing extremist material. Ten days later, he was shot dead by police after stabbing two people in South London.It was the second such attack in just over two months. At the end of November, 28-year-old Usman Khan killed two people near London Bridge, also in a stabbing attack, and was also shot dead by police. He had completed twoderadicalization programsas part of his 16-year sentence, of which he had also served half. His victims were fellow attendees at a conference on prisoner rehabilitation.The political debate in Britain since the latest attack has focused heavily on why Amman was freed. He had qualified for automatic early release from prison, yet was considered enough of a threat to be given police surveillance. The government now wants to change the law so terror sympathizers serve longer sentences, and are subject to more stringent assessment before release. But that won’t entirely solve the problem. “If you’re not rehabilitating prisoners, whether you let them out in two or four years isn’t very important,” said Arthur Snell, the former head of the British government’s anti-extremist Prevent program at the Foreign Office, who now runs a business-intelligence firm."
How Not to Talk About the Holocaust,2022-09-21,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"It’s rarely a good sign when the Holocaust trends on social media, and this week was no exception. On Sunday, in an interview with60 Minutes, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi declared that he needed more evidence to determine whether the Holocaust took place. “There are some signs that it happened,” hesaid. “If so, they should allow it to be investigated and researched.” That same day, on Twitter, a writer engaging in the usual internecine feuding on the leftfalselyclaimedthat America’s entry into World War II accelerated the Holocaust; a pile-on predictably ensued.As a grandson of Shoah survivors who is named after one of its victims, I certainly found these spectacles discomfiting. But they are far from unique. Indeed, it seems as though every month we are subjected to another politicized paroxysm over the Nazi genocide, in which the millions murdered are victimized once more by partisans who instrumentalize their deaths for contemporary political debates."
Emirati Ambassador: Qatar Is a Destructive Force in the Region,2017-08-28,TheAtlantic,"['Kathy Gilsinan, Jeffrey Goldberg']","Three months ago, six countries led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar, a fellow member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Qatar’s foes declared it complicit with extremism—citing, among other things, its support for the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas—and argued that it was too close to Iran, Saudi Arabia’s nemesis in the Middle East. Not long after,they issued13 demands to Qatar, including that it “curb diplomatic ties with Iran” and “shut down” the state-backed broadcaster Al Jazeera, and more generally “end interference in sovereign countries’ internal affairs” through contacts with opposition figures. Qatar vowed not to negotiate; despite some mediation efforts from the United States and Kuwait, the standoff has continued ever since. Last week, Qatar, trolling its erstwhile Gulf partners, restored diplomatic relations with Iran, which had been broken in  2016.The battle for leadership of the Gulf is also playing out in Washington, through hacks, leaks, and influence campaigns. Weeks before Qatar-GCC relations reached a crisis point, Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE’s ambassador to the United States—a person widely seen as the most influential Arab ambassador in Washington—saw his email account breached; new reports based on their contents are still surfacing. Immediately preceding the break in relations, other hackers allegedly planted a false story on Qatari news sites in which the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, is quoted calling Iran an “Islamic power” and urging the other Gulf states to drop their policy of confrontation with the country. The Qataris disavowed those remarks. The UAE was accused of orchestrating that hack; and the UAE in turn denied involvement.The level of dysfunction in the GCC has become breathtaking, even more so because President Trump has lined up with Saudi Arabia and the UAE against Qatar,declaringon Twitter that it was “so good to see” Saudi Arabia and others taking a hard line on Qatar, and that “perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!” It was not clear if Trump knew that Qatar hosted the biggest American air base in the Middle East, Al Udeid, which houses about 10,000 American military personnel and facilitates the campaign against ISIS. Trump’s State Department, though, apparently did know this, and Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, expressed the hope that Qatar’s antagonists would lift the trade and travel blockade they’d imposed on the country. The blockade remains largely in place.Otaiba usually prefers to keep out of the media spotlight. But in an interview with us, he set out to explain what precipitated the break with Qatar. “This is not the first rodeo,” he says. “We went through this in November of 2014”—when the Saudis and Emiratis withdrew their ambassadors for eight months—and “we had the same exact concerns and grievances.” Back then, relations were restored when Qatar signed on to a list of principles Otaiba says resembles the current set of demands; the demands are more detailed and onerous now, he says, because Qatar broke the 2014 agreement."
The Nameless Children of Gaza,2023-11-16,TheAtlantic,['Rund Abdelfatah'],"There are no children in Gaza. That’s what my mother says. There are no children, only old souls in miniature bodies. Because how can you be a child when you face the prospect of death from the moment you are born?A little more than a month has passed since Hamas’s horrific attack on October 7. I remember the heart-wrenching feeling of seeing innocent people, bloodied and broken, forever altered, saddled with a pain no one should have to endure.And then I thought of what would happen next, and my heart sank further because I knew terrible suffering would be unleashed on Gaza.In the weeks since, the Israeli military has carried out a relentless campaign of retaliation in one of the most densely populated places on Earth. Amid the constant bombardment, mothers wail, doctors rush to save patients before fuel runs out, and children tremble in fear. And so many die."
Tell Me How This Ends,2023-10-27,TheAtlantic,['Franklin Foer'],"In the year leading up to the invasion of Iraq, technocrats in Washington deployed their laptops and prepared for war. Their plans for the governing structures that would replace Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship filled bulging white papers, organizational flowcharts that spilled across thick binders, and dense memoranda for managing esoteric ministries.Israel is on the brink of testing a far different approach to regime change. Its leaders have announced a desire to dismantle the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip. Rather than entering battle with a carefully constructed blueprint for what might follow victory, though, they are winging it, improvising in the dazed aftermath of a devastating massacre that left its military and political leadership in a state of shame and confusion. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government announced its war aims before it had fully sketched out how it might effectively realize them.But the Israeli operation faces the same question that ultimately vexed the American project in Iraq: What comes next? Removing murderous Islamists from power solves one problem, but it creates another. Who will govern Gaza after Hamas?Thus far, the Israelis have answered the question only in the negative. Although some of the ultranationalists in the Netanyahu government openly fantasize about reoccupying Gaza, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has said that his government won’t pursue that path, which would come at a financial, military, and moral cost that Israel apparently doesn’t want to bear. But the alternative to a postwar occupation of some sort is lawlessness, which would permit Hamas’s return, thus undermining the very purpose of the war."
Why Older Socialists Are Quitting the DSA,2023-11-15,TheAtlantic,['Michael Powell'],"Nearly five decades ago, the organization that would become the Democratic Socialists of America united around core principles, including universal health care, workers’ rights, and support for the social-democratic state of Israel. That group included such left-liberal luminaries as California Representative Ron Dellums, the intellectuals Irving Howe and Cornel West, and future New York Mayor David Dinkins.The writer and activist Michael Harrington, whose Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee was a precursor to the DSA, declared in 1975: “I support Israel as an internationalist. Israel is a democratic country whose people are passionately defending its self-determination.” He added that to “preposterously charge” that Zionism is racism—as the United Nations General Assemblyasserted in a resolution that year—“is to drain the concept of racism of any serious meaning.”For Harrington and his comrades to speak that way in today’s unsubtle times would be inconceivable. DSA leaders, their organization swollen to 75,000 members, now describe Israel as an apartheid colonialist state. When, on October 7, Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups slaughtered 1,200 men, women, children, and infants, defiling and burning bodies, and tookmore than 240 prisonersinto captivity, the DSA, along with much of the organized left, called for members to flood the streets in protest. The object of their anger was not Hamas but Israel. “DSA is steadfast in expressing our solidarity with Palestine,” the DSA proclaimed on X, formerly Twitter, on the day of the massacre. “Today’s events are a direct result of Israel’s apartheid regime … Free Palestine.”"
Iran’s Influence Operation Pays Off,2023-09-28,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"When news comes out that someone has suffered an email breach, my first instinct is to pity them and practice extreme charity. I don’t remember any emails I wrote a decade ago, but I’m sure there’s something in there appalling enough to sour my relationships with every friend, ex, or co-worker I ever had. Give me your email password, and I will ruin your career.This week, the careers in jeopardy belong to a handful of Americans and Europeans who were, by the looks of their emails, groomed by the Iranian government to promote conciliatory policies toward Tehran. According to reports bySemaforandIran International, Iranian foreign-policy bigwigs such as Mohammad Javad Zarif identified think-tank staffers of Iranian origin, sponsored meetings with them, and used the group to coordinate and spread messages helpful to Iran. The emails, which date from 2014, suggest that those in their group—the “Iran Experts Initiative”—reacted to Iranian outreach in a range of ways, including cautious engagement and active coordination. The Iranian government then paid expenses related to this group’s internal meetings; cultivated its members with “access to high-ranking officials and extended invitations to visit Tehran,” according toIran International;and later gloated over how effectively it had used its experts to propagate the Islamic Republic’s positions.The government had reason to gloat. It picked excellent prospects, some of whom sucked up to Tehran over email and echoed its negotiating positions publicly. A few of them ended up in and near positions of prominence in the U.S. government through connections to Robert Malley, a veteran Middle East hand in Democratic administrations. Malley, who led Obama teams focusing on the Islamic State, Syria, and Iraq, is known to favor negotiation with unfriendly governments in the region and to scorn the “maximum pressure” approach that replaced nuclear negotiation when Donald Trump entered office. Earlier this year, Malleylosthis security clearance for reasons still not explained, and he is on leave from government service. (He did not reply to a request for comment.)"
There’s a Deal to Be Had Between the U.S. and Iran,2019-07-10,TheAtlantic,['Dennis Ross'],"Iran is now incrementally walking away from the limits imposed on it in the nuclear deal—the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA—exceeding the 300 kilograms of low enriched uranium it can have on hand and now enriching above the 3.67 percent allowed under the terms of the understanding. Don’t be surprised if it either starts to install its advanced centrifuges or begins to operate more than the 5,061 older centrifuges it is permitted for enrichment. Iran is not racing to produce weapons-grade material, but make no mistake, it is shrinking the time it will need to have a breakout capability.The Trump administration’s decision to end the waivers it had given eight countries to continue to buy Iranian oil, in late April, put the Iranians in a real bind. The country’s oil exports plummeted from roughly a million barrels a day to roughly 300,000. The resulting loss of revenue added dramatically to the already significant economic pressures caused by the American reimposition of sanctions—and the reality that multinational corporations felt the need to respect the sanctions lest they lose the ability to do business in the United States or get financing from American banks."
"When Iran Says ‘Death to Israel,’ It Means It",2022-07-15,TheAtlantic,['Behnam Ben Taleblu'],"In the days leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, distinguishedjournalists,analysts, andactivistsargued that Russian President Vladimir Putin was unlikely to green-light an assault that could go wrong in so many ways and instead might be bluffing. They employed a variety of political rationales to explain away the military buildup and escalating rhetoric. At the core of each explanation lay a troika of errors: denuding an adversary of agency, engaging in mirror-imaging, and, perhaps most of all, projecting a separate and more palatable logic onto the grimrealitypainted by thewordsand actions of a foreign leader.Many people who should know better assume that political leaders obscure the goals they wish to achieve or muddle the ideas that animate them, even though the historicalrecordsuggests the wisdom of taking them at face value. Clearly the world should have heeded Adolf Hitler’santi-Semitism during his rise to powerin Germany in the 1930s, and Osama bin Laden’sdeclarationof jihad against America in 1996."
Now It’s Nikki Haley,2023-11-30,TheAtlantic,['John Hendrickson'],"Does Nikki Haleyreallyhave a shot at beating Donald Trump? Does any Republican?On Monday afternoon, a basketball gym in Bluffton, South Carolina, was packed with people who had come to hear Haley’s latest sales pitch. Hundreds more were waiting outside. No Republican candidate besides Trump can reliably draw more than a thousand attendees, but about 2,500 showed up for Haley. (Granted, this speech was in Haley’s home state, where she formerly served as governor. Also, the gym was a stone’s throw from the Sun City retirement community, a place where, gently speaking, people may have had nothing better to do at 2 p.m. on a Monday.) One of Haley’s volunteers told me this weekday event had originally been booked at a nearby restaurant, but that, given the current excitement of the campaign, organizers pivoted to the gym, on the University of South Carolina at Beaufort campus. Everyone in Haley’s orbit is understandably riveted. She’s squarely challenging Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for second place in the Republican presidential primary, no matter how second that place may be.While the former president still floats high above his dwindling field of competitors, Haley is the only person who keeps rising in the polls. Her climb is steady, not a blip. Haley’s campaign and super PAC are planning to spend$10 millionon advertisements over the next eight weeks across Iowa and New Hampshire. On Tuesday, she receivedan endorsement from the Koch brothers’ network, Americans for Prosperity Action, and along with it an undisclosed amount of financial support. (It will be a lot.) But this year-end, all-in effort to stop Trump ignores the fact that he is a singular vortex, a once-in-a-century figure, a living martyr with a traveling Grateful Dead–like roadshow. His abhorrent behavior and legal woes do not matter. Three weeks ago, at his rally in South Florida, vendors told me thatitems with Trump’s mug shot are their biggest sellers. How does a meregenerationalfigure, as her supporters hope Haley might be, compete with that?"
Trump Just Got Palestinians' Hopes Up,2017-05-04,TheAtlantic,['Hussein Ibish'],"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s official delegation and the Palestinian mission in Washington haven’t been this ebullient or enthusiastic in at least a decade. One can certainly understand why. Abbas’svisitto the White House, strikingly early in the new Trump administration, is a political and diplomatic bonanza for Abbas as leader of the mainstream nationalist Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian Authority (PA). For them, it’s not a moment too soon.The PLO mission in Washington celebrated with a reception for Abbas that welcomed a veritable D.C. who’s who on the issue, including representatives of pro-Israel groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and others not usually at the head of such guest lists. But now that the party (literally) and the honeymoon (figuratively) are over, the deeply daunting work to translate the positive atmosphere into even modest progress between Israel and the Palestinians will begin in earnest. Painful hangovers all around are a distinct likelihood.The Palestinian enthusiasm for Donald Trump may be surprising to many, but it’s hardly mysterious. By prioritizing Israeli-Palestinian peace, the Trump administration has resurrected the Palestinian issue on the world stage (and hence also on the Middle Eastern stage) after several years during which it seemed to recede into the background. Indeed, Palestinians were despairing that their issue had been simply lost in the crush of other priorities such as the wars in Syria and Iraq, the rise of the Islamic State and the spread of al-Qaeda, the spread of Iranian influence in the Middle East and Saudi-led efforts to counter that. In its last two years, the Obama administration, and especially Barack Obama himself, seemed to lose interest in the peace process and the Palestinian issue, having apparently concluded that there was little or nothing that Washington could accomplish given the regional circumstances and the attitudes of the parties toward one another."
Why Are Americans Still So Nostalgic for 'The West Wing'?,2016-05-10,TheAtlantic,['David Sims'],"The White House press briefing has been presided over by its share of celebrity guests over the years, but when C.J. Cregg took the podium on April 29, it might’ve marked the first appearance of a fictional character. “Josh is out today, he has ... I believe it’s a root canal?” she quipped, probably referring to the incumbent Press Secretary Josh Earnest—or was itJosh Lyman, who had once stepped in for C.J. after her owndental emergency? Either way, she’d lost none of her poise. “Let’s be honest, I’m better at this than he is anyway,” she joked.Themoment wasmostly a fun political stunt: The actress Allison Janney, who played the role of Press Secretary C.J. Cregg for seven years on NBC’s hit dramaThe West Wing, eventually broke character and ceded the stage back to Earnest after briefly speaking about sufferers of opioid abuse. But the gag was also the latest in a long line of enthusiastic throwbacks to a show that depicted a gentler, more idealistic time for Washington D.C.—one where White House staffers could be realistically portrayed as hard-charging, lovable do-gooders.The West Winghas been off the air since 2006, but this unfulfilled desire for harmony and efficacy in the political process is perhaps why there’s been more nostalgia for the fictional Jed Bartlet administration than for any real one in recent memory.Though Janney was only in character for a couple of minutes, the sight of her behind the podium talking to reporters felt particularly meta—even for a show whose fictional elements have so often bled into, or influenced, reality.The West Wing, which debuted in 1999, is now old enough that it surely inspired some of the younger staffers in the Obama administration to get into politics. And when the show intrudes into the real world, it does so in ways partly playful and partly serious: Back in 2008, the fictional Democratic President Bartlet (Creggs’s boss) even “endorsed” Obama in Maureen Dowd’sNew York Timesop-ed column, via a peculiardream dialogueconjured by the show’s creator Aaron Sorkin.Since airing its series finale almost a decade ago,The West Winghas remained in the public consciousness, thanks to its easy availability on Netflix and an evolving world of Internet fandom, including a slew of popularTwitter accountsimitating the show’s main characters. Now, the actual cast is getting more involved with the nostalgia boom. In a recent episode ofTheLate Late Show, the host James Corden did a walk-and-talk sketch with Janney (back as Cregg), this time accompanied by a white-haired Bradley Whitford as Bartlet’s Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman. In March, the actor Joshua Malina (who played Will Bailey on the show’s later seasons) and the composer Hrishikesh Hirway launchedThe West Wing Weekly, a recap podcast that tackles an episode a week.Malina is now a regular onScandal, one of a new wave of popular shows that present a darker side of Washington thanThe West Wingdid—and that reflect the more cynical view many Americans today have of the political process.Scandalhas always highlighted its president’s human weaknesses: Fitzgerald Grant is a philanderer who had the election stolen for him and possesses little actual power. He’s also committed murder, as hasHouse of Cards’s Frank Underwood."
'The Most Simple Constitutional Arguments Become Complicated Once Guns Are Involved',2018-08-24,TheAtlantic,['Gabby Deutch'],"In 1971, a slim volume filled with instructions detailing how to create explosives and other weapons proliferated across bookshelves.The Anarchist Cookbookwas one ideological young American’s attempt to make a political statement; inthis case, the author was registering his opposition to the Vietnam War and the draft letter he had received. The book set off an urgent and fearful debate. In aletterto a top official at the Justice Department, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover wrote “of the inherent threat that distribution of the book poses to this country’s internal security.” But, helamented, “the FBI has no control over material published through the mass media.”Five years ago, another ideological young American published another kind of how-to manual. In the 21st-century iteration of the story, the medium is the internet, not a book; and instead of half-baked plans to build ineffective bombs, there are blueprints that can be downloaded as code and used to create functional plastic guns from a 3-D printer. At the time the material was published, the State Department claimed that 3-D-printed guns posed a direct threat to America’s national security. The State Department argued that the publication violated its arms-export controls, and sued to force the removal of the plans from the internet.

Peres’s chances of survival, Valden said, are “pretty good.”“I talked to him and asked him to press my hand, and he did so vigorously, and we are definitely convinced that he is awake and listening and reacting,” Valden told reporters gathered at the Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer.That diagnosis is a dramatic turnaround from Tuesday when it was reported that the 93-year-old former president suffered extensive inter-cranial bleeding following a stroke, and his son spoke of making“certain decisions.”"
The World Is a Thriving Slaughterhouse,2016-09-13,TheAtlantic,['Roger Rosenblatt'],"Here, lying ina stained carton, are notes on a refugee camp in Tanzania, where surviving Tutsis and their Hutu enemies lived side by side in blue tarp tents. It is 1994. The notes record that there are people everywhere, milling and moving in short parades on the main path in the camp, hastily constructed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Women wear colorful cloths,khangas, and carry yellow plastic containers of water on their heads. Children and old men push up against one another, as if at a bargain sale. They hold portable radios to their ears. A man in a brown rain hat drags a reluctant goat by a rope. White smoke mixes with the smells of fresh earth and excrement. At an outdoor butcher shop, a cow’s bloodied horn lies beside the animal’s astonished head. I greet a group of young Hutus in French. “Did you participate in the killings?,” I ask. “We did nothing,” one says. “Did you see others do the killing?” He says, “We saw nothing.” I ask, “How many Tutsis are left in Rwanda, do you think?” A teenage boy wearing a green baseball cap grins, and slowly draws the side of his index finger across his throat.Here are several photos of and notes on Divis Flats, a Catholic neighborhood, or stronghold, in Belfast. It is 1981. Coiled barbed wire runs atop a long gray wall on which is writtensmash h-block, a reference to the British prison in which members of the Irish Republican Army are held. Windows are pockmarked with bullet holes and display black flags of mourning for hunger strikers. Rats skitter in huge sewage pits, soggy with rain. Glass chips cover streets that are interrupted by “dragon’s teeth,” huge blocks of stone set out by the British army in uneven rows to prevent fast getaways. The presence of a stranger in the area is scrutinized, my every step tracked by a huddle of teenage boys with grim, bold faces, loitering beside a fire-blackened car. It is essential not to look British. The week before my arrival, a CBS reporter was stabbed at this same spot because he made the mistake of wearing a Burberry coat."
I Was a Child in a War,2023-10-24,TheAtlantic,['Bushra Seddique'],"I was born and raised in a war. I spent the first 20 years of my life in Afghanistan following the U.S. invasion. The war was always just a few months older than I was.I have lost friends and family to war. I have seen my neighbors’ dead bodies. I know how it feels to learn that a bomb blast has damaged your school; to sleep and live with the sounds of gunshots and explosions, the sirens of ambulances and fire trucks; to suddenly flee when your neighborhood is targeted; to seek shelter when nowhere is safe.I am far from alone in this. Children have always been victims of war—of religious conflict, armed interventions, fights between autocracies and democracies. When war comes, children suffer. That doesn’t mean we should accept their suffering as part of the cost of war. It means that their suffering is horrifyingly common."
The Most Dangerous Conflict No One Is Talking About,2023-12-02,TheAtlantic,['Timothy McLaughlin'],"First came the concrete markers engraved in multiple languages. Naval aviators from the Philippines would spot them during surveillance flights in the mid-1990s and dispatch forces to remove them. Then came the huts—small, wooden structures teetering on stilts on uninhabited islands, fit maybe for fishermen to take shelter during storms. They looked innocuous enough, one of the pilots, Alberto Carlos, recalls thinking.Only later did Carlos understand that he was witnessing the initial phases of China's conquest of the South China Sea. On rocky, barren islands, Beijing installed intelligence-gathering equipment, long-range surface-to-air missile systems, and stealth fighter jets. Over the past decade, China has added more than 3,200 acres of land to its seven occupied outposts in the Spratly Islands, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.The South China Sea is perhaps the most contested waterway in the world. China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, and Taiwan all have competing claims there. But no actor has pursued those claims as belligerently as China. The Philippines complains that Chinese forces menace its sailors and fishermen on an almost daily basis, and the government of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos has taken to airing videos, photos, and eyewitness accounts of these encounters. In late October, officials released footage of Chinese vessels twice colliding with Philippines ships."
WeWork’s Adam Neumann Is the Most Talented Grifter of Our Time,2019-10-25,TheAtlantic,['Derek Thompson'],"This is how the WeWork story ends—for now. The high-flying office-sharing startup, which introduced itself to the world as “a community company” with a mission to “to elevate the world’s consciousness,” is paying its founder, Adam Neumann, more than $1 billion to go away. Meanwhile, the company is so cash-poor that it cannot afford to pay the severances of the 4,000 workers it intends to cut.WeWork’s free fall from a projected valuation of nearly $50 billion to just $5 billion will likely be taught in business school, immortalized in best-selling books, and debated among analysts for years.  But one thing’s for sure: It has established Adam Neumann, who escaped from the wreckage a billionaire, as a figure of almost mythical monstrousness—like some capitalist chimera of Midas and Houdini.Neumann spent several years of his childhood living on Kibbutz Nir Am, a communitarian settlement near the Gaza Strip. And he has spent much of the rest of his life telling people about it. Just about every profile of Neumann mentions his childhood on the kibbutz—including write-ups inVanity Fair,Fast Company,Business Insider, andThe New York Times. He toldHaaretzthat his kibbutz upbringing molded his vision of WeWork. He has compared the office-sharing company, with its common areas and communal beer, to a “Kibbutz 2.0” and “a capitalist kibbutz.”"

Hamas Is Not ISIS,2023-10-27,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"Two weeks ago, Hamas declared a “Day of Rage”—an invitation for Muslims to rise up worldwide and express their hatred of Israel and its works. “Head to the squares and streets,” one of its leaders, Khaled Meshaal, said from Qatar. Arabs should bum-rush the Israeli border, and Muslims everywhere should wage war. “You know your responsibility,” he said. The time to study jihad was over. “To all who teach and learn, this is a moment for the application.”These words brought back waves of anti-nostalgia for anyone who watched the rise of the Islamic State almost a decade ago, like hearing an old song that you hate, or smelling a madeleine covered in mold. “Hamas is ISIS,” Israeli and American officials have said repeatedly since October 7. In 2014, the ISIS version of Meshaal’s call came from the organization’s chief terrorist, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani: “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies.” The message was very do-it-yourself: “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.” Adnani’sspeechkicked off a year of murder and carnage.ISIS and Hamas differ in at least this way: When Hamas asks random strangers to go spree-killing in its name, few comply. On the Day of Rage, demonstrations filled public squares in various countries, and an Israeli diplomat wasstabbedin Beijing. But the Day of Rage was mostly quiet. I spent the Rage afternoon in the Old City of Jerusalem, in case an uprising reached al-Aqsa Mosque. The Old City was quiet as a crypt. In fact, it wasquieterthan a crypt, and I know that because I spent part of it in a crypt—the Holy Sepulchre of Jesus Christ—and it was louder inside than out. I had a friendly conversation at normal volume with a Franciscan monk from Stuttgart, who remarked that the area had not been so empty since the darkest days of COVID."
How Do You Stop Lawmakers From Destroying the Law?,2023-03-01,TheAtlantic,['Anne Applebaum'],"Lorenzo Córdova is a lawyer and a scholar, a man with an office full of books. For most of the past decade, Córdova has served as president of the Mexican National Electoral Institute, an independent, nonpartisan but government-funded organization that first came into existence more than 30 years ago. The INE, as it is usually called (demonstrators chant “ee-nay,ee-nay”), has been so successful that until recently, its existence was taken for granted.Why? Because men and women like Córdova have spent the past three decades systematically creating an electoral register and voter-ID cards, still the most secure form of identification in Mexico. Every time an election happens, even in the remotest corners of the country, INE sets up tens of thousands of polling booths. Citizen poll workers are recruited through a national lottery and trained to run polling stations, and INE organizes that too. Factors well outside INE’s remit—poverty, violence, clientelism—continue to undermine Mexican politics, and like any institution, INE makes mistakes. Still, most judge it by its greatest achievement: Mexico was a one-party state for most of the 20th century, where the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party fraudulently dictated electoral outcomes. Now the voters decide.Last Wednesday, I was sitting in Córdova’s office when that achievement suddenly seemed doomed. While we were talking, we received news that the Mexican Senate had passed a law that, if upheld by the courts, will make Mexican elections much less secure. The law, propounded by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his ruling Morena party, is described as an “electoral reform” that will save money. But by depriving INE of much of the funding it needs to actually run elections, it could render the institute ineffective. Córdova told me that the bill could force INE to fire 85 percent of its civil servants, perhaps making it impossible to recruit and train poll workers, or even to hold legitimate elections at all."
How Decades of Lax Rules Enable Train Disasters,2023-03-23,TheAtlantic,['Kendra Pierre-Louis'],"Updated at 4:30 p.m. ET on March 23, 2023.It’s been more than a month since a Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. More than 100,000 gallons of vinyl chloride, a carcinogen, were released, with some spilling into waterways. Many hundreds of people had to evacuate from their homes. An estimated 43,000 aquatic animals died. When emergency responders burned the cars containing vinyl chloride in an attempt to avoid an explosion, the fire likely created long-lasting toxic chemicals called dioxins. Hundreds of thousands of gallons of now-toxic water used to put out the fire had to be shipped to Texas to be disposed of deep underground. And if dioxins were created, they could trickle into the ground over time, contaminating the water in a community where people rely heavily on wells. Last week,Ohio sued Norfolk Southernfor what the state’s attorney general called “glaring negligence.”In East Palestine, small failures cascaded into catastrophe because of railway deregulation that began four decades ago. Preventing the worst accidents requires layers of intervention, but in the U.S., those layers have been steadily peeled back. Indeed, the same risk factors that led to the mess in East Palestine also led to a deadly derailment nearly a decade ago, and could easily lead to another tragedy."
How a Saudi-Israeli Alliance Could Benefit the Palestinians,2017-11-18,TheAtlantic,['Hussein Ibish'],"The flirtation between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which has been gainingmomentumboth publicly and privately in recent years, seems to be picking up even more steam now, especially on the Israeli side. Israel’s Military Chief of Staff General Gadi Eizenkot gave a wide-ranginginterviewto a major Saudi website offering greaterintelligence cooperation, among other overtures. Israel isco-sponsoringa draft Saudi UN resolution on Syria. And Israel’s communications ministerpraisedcomments by the Saudi Grand Mufti that were highly critical of Hamas, and invited him to visit Israel. ReciprocalSaudi moveshave been moresubtleand oftenunofficial, yet signs of an increasing recognition of the potential value of working more closely with Israel tocounter Iranare readily discernible inGulf Arabdiscourse.Most attention on this issue has focused on Iran, because countering Tehran’s growing regional power—particularly as the war in Syria winds down, and with Iran and its allies gaining control ofkey strategic areasalong the Syrian-Iraqi border—is uppermost in the minds of Saudis and Israelis alike. Both also feel keenly menaced by Iran’s most effective Arab proxy, Hezbollah, which has emerged from the Syrian war much more powerful than before, and has engaged in conflicts around the region. But, especially if something more significant develops from these overtures, what might all this mean for the Palestinians?"
Trump Did Not Bring Jerusalem Crashing Down,2017-12-08,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"JERUSALEM—After President Trump’s announcement recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital on Wednesday, the Palestinian militant group Hamas called for three “days of rage” to protest the decision. Many people answered that call.In Gaza, the Palestinian territory governed by Hamas a few hours south of Jerusalem, Israeli fire killed at least one Palestinian protester, according toThe Associated Press. Journalistshavereporteda march of thousands of people in Amman, Jordan, roughly 40 miles from Jerusalem as the crow flies. Other protests arehappeningas far away as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan.But Jerusalem—the political and geographical center of the debate—stayed relatively quiet. Although the comparative calm of Palestinians here may seem surprising, they, unlike Muslims in faraway places, may have more to lose from major protests.On Friday, it seemed that every journalist in Jerusalem was waiting for something to happen at the Damascus Gate in the Old City—one of the most popular entrances Muslims use to reach the famous Al-Aqsa mosque for Friday afternoon prayers, and a common site for big protests. Yet the resulting melee was not the massive demonstration everyone seemed to be waiting for."
China Changed Its Mind About World War II,2023-10-17,TheAtlantic,['Gary J. Bass'],"When Chinese officials and elites berate Japan, as they frequently do these days, they often pointedly mention the atrocities that Imperial Japan committed after invading their country in the 1930s. In March, Qin Gang, then China’s foreign minister, warned the Japanese that forgetting their history meant denying crimes that they then might repeat. China’s paramount leader, Xi Jinping, uses the memory of World War II to justify the present-day bluster of a rising global power. “Chinese people who have made such a great sacrifice,” Xi said in 2014, “will not waver in protecting a history written in sacrifice and blood.” When nationalistic Japanese politicians such as Shinzo Abe and Junichiro Koizumi have paid their respects at a Tokyo shrine whose honorees include convicted war criminals, Chinese patriots have exploded with state-sanctioned rage.One reason that East Asia’s two greatest economic powers are still sparring about a bygone war is that the most important international attempt to confront that past—the Tokyo war-crimes trial after World War II—failed to promote a common understanding of who was guilty of what. The trial of Nazi leaders at Nuremberg has taken on an almost sacred status in democratic Germany and its neighbors. By contrast, the Tokyo proceedings left behind ambiguities and grievances more than sufficient to fuel not only geopolitical struggles in Asia but also political intrigue within China itself."

"What Hamas Promises, Iranians Know Too Well",2023-11-22,TheAtlantic,['Roya Hakakian'],"Of all the cataclysmic events I have ever experienced, October 7 affected me like no other. The videos of hateful protests and bloody or charred bodies unearthed memories I’d long kept buried. In one, I am a girl standing in the doorway of our home in Tehran, staring at graffiti that appeared overnight on a neighbor’s wall. Punctuated by a swastika—something I had never seen before—were three words, scrawled in black paint on red brick:Kikes get lost.This was in January 1979, just a few weeks before Iran’s Islamic Revolution, and nothing was as it had been. The rest of the world saw the revolution embodied in the figure of the ascetic cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, seated cross-legged on a cot in a spartan room in the suburbs of Paris. But for those of us in Iran, its signs were uncomfortably close, ubiquitous, and inescapable. “Allahu akbar!” was its soundtrack—an all-purpose call that was at times a plea, at other times a call to arms. The streets were ablaze with bonfires that winter, tires and much else set aflame. Whatever harm the Great Satan, America, and the Little Satan, Israel, had allegedly inflicted on the nation before, at least in those few weeks of a nationwide oil shortage, those countries’ burning flags kept the protesters warm.Finally came the revolution’s most indelible sign of all: the Islamic dress code forced on women, who could wear only black, gray, brown, or navy blue. The mandatory hijab drained a once-colorful capital of its vibrant hues, casting half of the population into shadow. Women demonstrated in opposition to the order, but they had few allies. Even the secular intelligentsia banded with the ayatollah, dismissing the protests and the blatant anti-Semitic and anti-feminist character of the new leadership as a few minor quirks upon which the great revolution could not afford to dwell."
Israel’s Impossible Dilemma,2023-12-04,TheAtlantic,['Hussein Ibish'],"To no one’s surprise, Israel and Hamas have resumed fighting in Gaza after almost a week of temporary truces and prisoner exchanges. Despite American and other entreaties to limit civilian casualties, Israel appears determined to push into the south of Gaza, but its strategic thinking seems to end there, and to hold no plausible endgame in sight. As a consequence, the next phase of this vicious conflict will almost certainly lead Israel to an unenviable dilemma: whether to grant Hamas a small and ultimately hollow victory or a much larger and all-too-real one.The next stages of the fighting seem clear. Israel will likely seize all of the significant aboveground urban areas in Gaza’s south, just as it did in the north. After that will come a major battle for control of Hamas’s extensive underground tunnel network, where most of the group’s fighters, leaders, equipment, and remaining hostages are presumed to be located. Ultimately, Israel may seek to destroy the tunnels themselves, perhaps by flooding them with seawater. In doing so, Israel will expect to have inflicted irreparable harm on Hamas, rendering it unable to govern Gaza or pose a threat to southern Israel for the foreseeable future."
The Women Who Saw 9/11 Coming,2023-11-18,TheAtlantic,['Liza Mundy'],"One day toward the end of the 20th century, John Rizzo, a career lawyer at the Central Intelligence Agency, found himself chatting with Jack Downing—a former Marine and stalwart Cold Warrior who had been brought out of retirement to oversee the clandestine service.The two men were talking about an analyst named Michael Scheuer, the cerebral but polarizing leader of a team focused on a terrorist group called al-Qaeda. Skeptical that Scheuer was up to the job, Downing brought up a perceived weakness of his staff. “The only people who work for him are girls,” he scoffed.It was a small moment, but one Rizzo never forgot. “I remember him sayinggirls,” Rizzo told me in an interview before his death in 2021. Ironically, Downing, who also died in 2021, was seen as relatively supportive of women at the CIA.Back in 2018, I met with a group of CIA historians to talk about women’s roles and experiences at the agency. The historians pointed to the striking number of women engaged in several key missions, chief among them the tracking of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, both before and after the 9/11 attacks; Scheuer’s team of “girls” played a key part. Over three years of book research, I interviewed more than one hundred female officers at the agency, including at least a half dozen who were involved in the bin Laden effort—some of whom had not spoken previously about their work, or not extensively—as well as many of their male colleagues. What became clear in these conversations was that many of the women who charted al-Qaeda’s rise felt that their work was undervalued or ignored and that their gender was part of the equation."
The Open Plot to Dismantle the Federal Government,2023-09-24,TheAtlantic,['Russell Berman'],"Of the many targets Donald Trump has attacked over the years, few engender less public sympathy than the career workforce of the federal government—the faceless mass of civil servants that the former president and his allies deride as the “deep state.”Federal employees have long been an easy mark for politicians of both parties, who occasionally hail their nonpartisan public service but far more frequently blame “Washington bureaucrats” for stifling your business, auditing your taxes, and taking too long to renew your passport. Denigrating the government’s performance is a tradition as old as the republic, but Trump assigned these shortcomings a sinister new motive, accusing the civilian workforce of thwarting his agenda before he even took office.As he runs again for a second term, Trump is vowing to “dismantle the deep state” and ensure that the government he would inherit aligns with his vision for the country. Unlike during his 2016 campaign, however, Trump and his supporters on the right—including several former high-ranking members of his administration—have developed detailed proposals for executing this plan. Immediately upon his inauguration in January 2025, they would seek to convert thousands of career employees into appointees fireable at will by the president. They would assert full White House control over agencies, including the Department of Justice, that for decades have operated as either fully or partially independent government departments."
Trump Goes After 'the Ultimate Deal',2017-05-22,TheAtlantic,['Rosie Gray'],"JERUSALEM—Is Donald Trump the last best hope for the peace process?As a candidate, Trump was an iconoclast in many ways, but by and large he hewed to the positions on Israel typical of Republican presidential candidates. Trump promised to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and railed against the Iran deal.Trump’s promises reassured the Israeli right and the pro-Israel American right. He earned rave reviews from figures like the Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett,who declaredafter the election that “Trump's victory is a tremendous opportunity for Israel to immediately announce its intention to renege on the idea of establishing Palestine in the heart of the country—a direct blow to our security and the justice of our cause.”But Trump had, more than once, expressed an interest in the peace process during the campaign, even saying at one point that he would be a “neutral guy” on the issue. And as president, Trump has so far shown a surprising amount of focus and flexibility on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process—and a surprising amount of willingness to spend political and diplomatic capital on it, seeking what he calls the “ultimate deal.” Trump repeatedly professed his wish to make such a deal during Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas’s visit to Washington earlier in May, which came a few weeks after Trump publicly asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a joint press conference to “hold back” on Israeli settlements in the West Bank “for a little bit.” Trump hasn’t specifically promised that the ultimate deal means a two-state solution (“I’m looking at two states and one state, and I like the one that both parties like,”he saidin February), but his National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster has referred to “Palestinian self-determination.”This has heartened veterans of the peace process who have seen negotiations break down repeatedly, most recently during the Obama administration. Trump arrived in Israel on Monday, with what several people described as an opportunity to inject more life into the moribund peace process than it’s had since the last round of talks broke down in 2014.But the political chaos engulfing his White House is a distraction, and Trump doesn’t appear to have a deep appreciation of just how difficult and detailed these negotiations are—“It is something that I think is frankly, maybe, not as difficult as people have thought over the years,” Trump said during Abbas’s visit to Washington—and underlying conditions on both sides remain unfavorable. Plus, Trump administration officials spent the week before the visit getting into spats with the Israelis over whether the Western Wall is in Israel and whether he will move the embassy to Jerusalem. The most serious issue of all was Trump’s sharing classified intelligence on ISIS, reportedly provided by the Israelis, with Russian officials visiting him in the Oval Office. (Trump may have further antagonized his hosts in declaring at a joint appearance with Netanyahu in Jerusalem that he had “never mentioned” Israel in his meeting with the Russians, raising questions about whether he was confirming publicly for the first time that Israel had in fact provided the intelligence.)"
There’s More to Being Jewish Than Fighting Anti-Semitism,2018-05-04,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"A Jewish journalist lives in the big city. He is largely secular and proudly defies religious traditions; he runs easily with his generation’s cohort of elite writers and thinkers. When evidence of virulent anti-Semitism begins to emerge around him, he is shocked. Jews must wake up and recognize their dire situation, he thinks. If only they could band together, he imagines, Jews could not just survive, but thrive: a light unto the nations, modeling humanitarianism and tolerance.This was the story of Theodor Herzl, who is credited as the founder of political Zionism and the father of the State of Israel. But it is also the story of Jonathan Weisman, aNew York Timesreporter who has written a book, (((Semitism))), about the peculiar challenges of being an American Jew in 2018. Both men became aware, rather suddenly, of the potency of anti-Semitism; both have called for a strengthening of Jewish identity in a time of relative Jewish empowerment. Herzl looked east, aspiring to create a Jewish state in Palestine. More than a century later, the success of Herzl’s solution has become Weisman’s major grievance: The writer complains that American Jewish organizations have all become “enthralled with [the] same mission … all spoke of, lobbied on, and raised money for Israel, Israel, Israel.” Meanwhile, he says, neo-Nazis grab headlines, shouting slogans like “Hail victory!” and “You will not replace us!” at rallies on the National Mall. When this happened last summer, Weisman says, “The Jews slept.”Weisman’s book never overcomes this foundational flaw: It is based on the wildly inaccurate claim that American Jews are not talking about, thinking about, and calling out anti-Semitism. Weisman, alarmed by swirling hatred and lack of Jewish communal cohesion, seems to have cast about for someone to blame and settled on Jews themselves; his facts are wobbly and his prescriptions are thin. Yet the urgency of his project—finding a unified Jewish identity in a time of fracture, assimilation, and recurring bigotry—marks a development that has been unimaginable to Jews for two or three generations: Once again, hate toward Jews is rising. Once again, Jews are distressingly divided. Once again, there is no easy solution to protect Jews’ moral, political, or physical future.As its title suggests, Weisman’s book identifies virulent anti-Semitism as the major existential challenge facing American Jewry, a perpetual nightmare that reemerges, cicada-like, in every generation. The Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish organization that most actively tracks anti-Semitism in the U.S.,reporteda major spike in anti-Jewish hate in 2017. Weisman himself has been a target. Like other prominent journalists, he had his Twitter account flooded with hundreds upon hundreds of anti-Semitic memes and slurs. He was marked for the onslaught when a user placed triple parentheses around his name, allowing trolls to locate him easily through a clever web-browser tool. He now wields the parentheses defiantly in his Twitter profile. Appropriately, the marks also decorate the title of his book.While the problem of anti-Semitism is not novel to the Trump era, Weisman argues, the president has not actively discouraged bigotry, blowing enough dog whistles and making enough excuses to leave far-right agitators feeling empowered. “Whether he knew it or not, Donald Trump ran the most anti-Semitic presidential campaign in modern American history,” Weisman writes. “Haplessness is not a defense.”"
"Putin Is Worried, So He Turned to Anti-Semitism",2023-09-24,TheAtlantic,['Leon Aron'],"After Joseph Stalin died in 1953, an underground joke from my Moscow youth declared, the Politburo found three envelopes on the Soviet dictator’s desk. The first, inscribed “Open after my death,” contained a letter telling his successors to place his body next to Lenin’s in the Red Square Mausoleum. “Open when things get bad,” read the second envelope, and the note inside said, “Blame everything on me!” The third envelope, marked “Open when things getreallybad,” commanded, “Do as I did!”Things must be really bad for Russian President Vladimir Putin, because he is resorting to one of Stalin’s preferred ways of holding on to power: appealing to anti-Semitism. Recently, Putin has made a series of remarks dwelling on the fact that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish. And in adiscussionat an economic forum earlier this month, Putin mocked Anatoly Chubais, a half-Jewish former Kremlin adviser who fled Russia after its invasion of Ukraine last year andis reportedly living in Israel. “He is no longer Anatoly Borisovich Chubais,” Putin said, using his former aide’s first name and patronymic. “He isMoshe Izrayilevich, or some such.”As a scholar who has been studying Soviet and Russian politics for decades; who discusses that subject regularly with friends, family members, and professional colleagues; and who keeps tabs on what Putin’s critics say about him, I cannot remember him publicly trafficking in anti-Semitism before now. Indeed, his seemingly benevolent attitude toward his Jewish subjects made him unusual among Russian leaders. For more than a century until 1917, Jews in the Russian empire were confined to the Pale of Settlement, mostly in what today is Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and Lithuania, and were terrorized by periodic pogroms. Early in the 20th century, the czar’s secret policepropagated (and are widely suspected of sponsoring)The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, avicious anti-Semitic forgerythat purported to expose a Jewish conspiracy to take over the world and has inspired generations of violent anti-Semites."
Even Democrats Keep Thinking Iran Is Worse Than Saudi Arabia,2019-05-21,TheAtlantic,['Peter Beinart'],"Updated at 11:42 a.m. ET on May 22, 2019.With ideas like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are challenging the ideological parameters that have defined American domestic policy since the Reagan era. If only they were doing so on foreign policy too.Consider their responses to President Donald Trump’s recent escalation with Iran. Yes,oneDemocratafteranotherhascalledonCongressto prevent Trump from going to war. But Democrats have not frontally challenged the core assumption underlying Trump’s belligerence: that Iran is a uniquely malevolent actor in the Middle East.Even as he criticized Trump’s recent actions, Representative Seth Moulton last weekcalledIran “a major threat to our national security.” In a statement emailed by her staff, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand condemned its “malign activities.” Senator Cory Booker has in the pastinsistedthat the United States “be more vigilant than ever in fighting Iranian aggression.”By echoing the GOP’s confrontational language, these Democrats are forgetting a crucial lesson of the Iraq War. America didn’t invade Baghdad only because people such as John Bolton, then undersecretary of state for arms control, misrepresented intelligence on weapons of mass destruction. America invaded because, under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Democrats and Republicans so inflated the threat from Saddam Hussein that restoring normal economic and diplomatic relations with his regime became politically impossible. The result was a web of sanctions that no administration could lift, and a glide path to war."
Bernie Sanders Offers a Foreign Policy for the Common Man,2018-10-15,TheAtlantic,['Peter Beinart'],"Last Tuesday, Bernie Sanders delivered aspeechentitled “A Global Democratic Movement to Counter Authoritarianism.” In so doing, he resurrected the legacy of a man mostly forgotten by the makers of American foreign policy: Henry Wallace.Wallace is best known for his renegade 1948 presidential run, in which he argued for cooperation—not cold war—with the Soviet Union. But his most significant statement on foreign policy came six years earlier in a debate with the publisher Henry Luce.In February 1941, Luce penned an essay inLifemagazine entitled “The American Century.” America, he argued, should not just enter World War II. It should enter the war with the goal of dominating the world that followed. It was time for “Americans to accept wholeheartedly our duty and opportunity as the most powerful and vital nation in the world and in consequence to exert upon the world the full impact of our influence, for such purposes as we see fit and by such means as we see fit.” By exerting its impact on the world, Luce argued, America—with its inherent goodness—would uplift the world, too. The United States was already “the sanctuary of the ideals of civilization.” Now, it should become “the powerhouse from which the ideals spread.”"

Last month, he told a Senate committee that it would be good for an “effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority to have governance and ultimately security responsibility for Gaza,” where the PA has been powerless and unwelcome for the past 15 years. On Wednesday, Blinken said again that Gaza should be “unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.”Indirect rule by the Palestinian Authority is a moonshot idea, but it’s preferable to an indefinite Israeli presence—an idea floated on ABC this week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And because most of the other post-invasion ideas (rule by Egypt, American troops on the ground) may as well be trips to Alpha Centauri, this particular moonshot is worth considering in some detail. Already a few Israeli politicians have broached it. At a press conference last month, the leader of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, said, “The best thing is that the Palestinian Authority goes back into Gaza.” I suggested that this sounded like wishful thinking. Lapid replied that the PA still had thousands of loyalists in Gaza, which was more than could be said for any of the other possible entities that might take over."
A Devastating Attack by Hamas,2023-10-07,TheAtlantic,['Juliette Kayyem'],"The attacks by Hamas against Israel beginning early this morning, some of which are ongoing, will be met by Israelwith force. How all of this will unfold, and its impact on domestic and global politics, is not clear, but a simple answer may suffice for now: It will not go well. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already warned his citizens that they are at war; civil reservists have been called up; videos are showing hand battles on the streets. The country is on lockdown, with the potential for future strikes in the south by Hamas and new ones by Hezbollah in the north. A country torn apart by domestic divisions seems to be united against a common enemy. As of this writing, the death toll is confirmed at a minimum of70 Israelis, with hundreds more wounded.One aspect of this needs little analysis, but a lot of explanation: How did Israel’s extensive counterterrorism efforts fail to pick up an attack waged by land, sea, and air? How did its defenses fail so extensively? This wasn’t just an intelligence failure. It was an everything failure.Israeli and Americancommentators are already describing this as Israel’s 9/11, but that comparison is a crutch—9/11 was about, in the words of the commission that reviewed it, a “failure of imagination” to understand what could happen in America, a nation that had not encountered foreign terror threats of any significant magnitude. Israel has existed, still exists, with that very imaginable prospect as part of its national being."
The Republican Primary Is Slipping Away,2023-11-09,TheAtlantic,['Russell Berman'],"“We’ve become a party of losers,” the conservative businessman Vivek Ramaswamy declared during the opening minutes of tonight’s Republican primary debate in Florida. He bemoaned the GOP’s lackluster performance in yesterday’s elections, and then he identified the Republican he held personally responsible for the party’s defeats. Was this the moment, a viewer might have wondered, that a top GOP presidential contender would finally take on Donald Trump, the absent front-runner who hasn’t deigned to join his rivals on the debate stage?Of course not.Ramaswamy proceeded to blame not the GOP’s undisputed leader for the past seven years but Ronna McDaniel, the party functionary—unknown to most Americans—who chairs the Republican National Committee. After calling on McDaniel to resign, Ramaswamy then attacked one of the debate moderators, Kristen Welker of NBC News, before turning his ire on two of his onstage competitors, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis."

Europe's Ubiquitous Anti-Semitism,2019-02-21,TheAtlantic,['Ben Judah'],"Growing up, I used to think anti-Semitism was like the black death: tragic, nightmarish, and historic. It had wiped out millions of people. It was theoretically terrifying. But only occasional outbreaks in poor and faraway countries remained. It had ruined the life of my grandmother, but it would not be part of mine.But now I realize that anti-Semitism is actually like the flu: uncomfortable, sickly, occasionally deadly, but constantly with us. Every few decades, it mutates into an epidemic. The rest of the time it lingers, producing headaches, sweats, and dizzy spells. Not killing us, just wearing us down.As a British Jew, with dual French citizenship and Jewish family in Paris, I have felt the cold now for some time; I’m trying to remember when I first felt it coming on. Was it when the Labour splitter George Galloway was elected as a member of Parliament in East London on the back of an anti-Semitic campaign in 2005? Or was it when Ilan Halimi was abducted and murdered by anti-Semites in Paris in 2006?"
ISIS Has Turned Most of the World Against It. So How Is It Still Winning?,2015-10-12,TheAtlantic,['Dominic Tierney'],"Nearly two millennia ago, the Romans built the Arch of Triumph in Palmyra, Syria. According toPicturesque Palestine, Sinai, and Egypt, published in 1881, “The wonder in these ancient ruins is not that so much has fallen, but that anything remains.” Last week, ISISblew the Arch of Triumph, which the group considers idolatrous, to pieces. Such acts of aggression and barbarism have mobilized a vast enemy coalition, which includes almost every regional power and virtually every great power (and notably the United States, often compared to the Roman Empire in its hegemonic strength). Yet, incredibly, this alliance seems incapable of rolling back the Islamic State. How can a group of insurgents declare war on humanity—and win?One of the basic principles of military strategy is that the attacker needs preponderant force to win. “It is the rule in war,”wroteSun Tzu inThe Art of War, “if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.”ISIS has thrown this rulebook out the window by declaring war on one adversary after another—and then striking them with inferior numbers of troops.In 2011, ISIS (then under the name of the Islamic State of Iraq) intervened in the Syrian Civil War and attacked the regime in Damascus, along with its allies (Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah) as well as moderate and Islamist Syrian opposition forces. In 2014, with the outcome of the Syrian conflict still in the balance, ISIS launched a major offensive into Iraq, thereby massively expanding the opposing coalition to include Iraq, Iranian-trained militias, the United States, Britain, and France. Unperturbed, ISIS then struck Kurdistan, and the ranks of its enemies swelled further.By conventional logic, the militants’ strategy is reckless and even suicidal—the design of an apocalyptic cult with a death wish.On one side of the battlefield there’s ISIS, with itstensof thousandsof fighters.On the other side of the battlefield is the anti-ISIS coalition, which includes four out of five permanent members of the UN Security Council (the United States, Russia, Britain, and France). Even the sole holdout, China,has signaledit may aid the Iraqi regime through intelligence-sharing and arms sales. The coalition also includes most regional players: Turkey, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, and the Gulf states. Did I mention that the most powerful non-state actors in the region, including Hezbollah and the Kurds, are also arrayed against ISIS?"
Take It From an Iraq War Supporter—War With Iran Would Be a Disaster,2019-05-15,TheAtlantic,['David Frum'],"The Iraq War of 2003 was undone by blithe assumptions, cultural ignorance, and careless planning. But compared with the accelerating drive to confront Iran, the Iraq War looks like a masterpiece of meticulous preparation.The project of a war with Iran is so crazy, it remains incredible that Donald Trump’s administration could truly be premeditating it. But on the off, off chance that it is, here’s a word of caution from a veteran of the George W. Bush administration: Don’t do it.I supported the Iraq War in 2003 because I believed the Bush administration’s case that Iraq was again actively seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. (A first program had been destroyed by Israeli warplanes in 1981; a second had been halted by UN inspectors after the Gulf War of 1990–91.)Yet the goal in 2003 was bigger than denuclearization. Iraq’s Saddam Hussein was both oppressing his own subjects and menacing his neighbors. By replacing Saddam’s regime with a more humane and peaceful successor, the U.S. could set the Arab Middle East on a path to a better future—contributing to America’s own security after 9/11."
Netanyahu’s Odd Embrace of Elon Musk,2023-11-30,TheAtlantic,['Adam Serwer'],"Less than a month after the billionaire Elon Musk enthusiastically endorsed the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that motivated the deadliestmassacre of Jews in American history, this week, he received a warm welcome to Israel from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Since Musk took over Twitter, which he has renamed X, the sort ofhateful content that drivesboth negative and positive engagement has flourished on the site. But he has also directly promoted some of the most toxic claims on the platform.He endorsed as “the actual truth” the ideathat Jews were deliberately supporting the immigration of nonwhite people in an act of “hatred against whites.” The post’s implication was that not restricting immigration to Western countries on the basis of race and religion is racist against white people, who have a raciallydefined right to political, cultural, and demographic hegemonyin those nations.As my colleagueYair Rosenberg notes, “It wasn’t the first time Musk echoed anti-Semitic conspiracy theories from his social-media bubble.” No conspiracy theory is necessary to explain why people flee poverty and persecution for nations with greater economic opportunity or political freedom; this is a large part of the story of the United States of America. But perhaps Musk finds in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories a useful means of redirecting frustration over social change or economic hardship away from the obscenely wealthy, like himself, who profit from lower marginal tax rates and a more threadbare social safety net."
Not a World War But a World at War,2023-11-17,TheAtlantic,['Paul Poast'],"Just in the past 24 months, an astonishing number of armed conflicts have started, renewed, or escalated. Some had been fully frozen, meaning that the sides had not sustained direct combat in years; others were long simmering, meaning that low-level fighting would intermittently erupt. All have now become active.The list encompasses not just the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, but hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, Serbian military measures against Kosovo, fighting in Eastern Congo, complete turmoil in Sudan since April, and a fragile cease-fire in Tigray that Ethiopia seems poised to break at any time. Syria and Yemen have not exactly been quiet during this period, and gangs and cartels continuously menace governments, including those in Haiti and Mexico. All of this comes on top of the prospect of a major war breaking out in East Asia, such as by China invading the island of Taiwan.The Uppsala Conflict Data Program, which has been tracking wars globally since 1945,identified2022 and 2023 as the most conflictual years in the world since the end of the Cold War. Back in January 2023, before many of the above conflicts erupted, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed sounded the alarm,notingthat peace “is now under grave threat” across the globe. The seeming cascade of conflict gives rise to one obvious question: Why?"
‘U.S. Relations With Turkey Are Not Good at this Time’,2018-08-11,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"President Donald Trump announced Friday that he had ordered the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports, exacerbating relations with aNATOally that has proven intransigent in recent years.“I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!”Trump said on Twitter. “Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!”One could argue they haven’t been “good” for some time. Özgür Ünlühisarcikli, an expert on transatlantic relations with the German Marshall Fund in Ankara, said Trump’s tariffs are “very bad news for Turkey-U.S. relations in the short run, in the medium run, and even more in the longer run.”In the short term, he told me, the impact will be on the Turkish economy, as has been seen so far. In the medium run, he said, there will be security challenges for Turkey that will affect Ankara’s security preferences. “But the real impact will be on the longer run,”Ünlühisarcikli said. “I believe that all of this is putting Turkey on a path toward distance from the West. This might not be desirable for either the United States or Turkey at this moment. But it could become a vicious cycle, and it might become too late soon to reverse this.”"
A Very British Protest,2018-07-13,TheAtlantic,['Sophie Gilbert'],"LONDON—The first protestors began assembling on Portland Place, just outside the BBC’s London headquarters, on Friday morning. They carried signs. “FEED HIM TO THE CORGIS,” said one. “TANGERINE TYRANT,” read another. “BOLLOCKS TO TRUMP.” “IKEA HAS BETTER CABINETS.” “TRUMP IS A TOSSER.” “I HAD TO FIX MY PRINTER FOR THIS.”The people gathering to march in protest of President Trump’s U.K. visit had serious intentions, namely to stand up against a leader who’s remarkably unpopular in Britain. But that didn’t mean the tone was totally somber. As the first march of the day, the #BringTheNoise rally, began at 12 p.m., crowds of mostly women carried placards and banners sporting a variety of messages, each more irreverent than the last. “SUPER CALLOUS FRAGILE RACIST SEXIST LYING POTUS,” blared one. “HANDS OFF DONALD,” read another, the words superimposed over a picture of Queen Elizabeth with a red cross over her lower half. One more polite sign, painstakingly crafted on pale-blue paper with floral appliqués and Liberty-print lettering, read “NASTY ENGLISH LADIES AGAINST TRUMP’S MISOGYNY, RACISM, HOMOPHOBIA, ABLEISM, TRANSPHOBIA, ISLAMOPHOBIA.”As far as pastimes go, there are few things that thrill the British more than the art of creative profanity. It’s a tradition that dates back at leastto Shakespeare. So Trump’s visit to the U.K. presented the opportunity for many to protest, but also to exercise a little national pride while doing so. Kate Bottley, a vicar who wore her clerical collar on the march,carried a signthat read “I CAME HERE TO DRINK TEA AND FIGHT FASCISM AND I’VE JUST FINISHED MY TEA.” The slogan was a reference to a quote from the British sitcomThe I.T. Crowd, she said, but also an attempt to keep things dignified. “You know that things are bad when the clergy are getting grumpy about it,” she said. “But one of the things that’s amazing about today is how peaceful it is. There’s a lovely, celebratory atmosphere. It’s really brought people together.”As the earlier women’s march moved down Regent Street toward Trafalgar Square, protestors began gathering for the day’s main event, a larger and more charged assembly of people. The tone, though, remained jovial. One marcher dragged along a speaker blasting the Sex Pistols’ “God Save the Queen.” Among protestors marching for Palestine and a group of women dressed in red gowns and white bonnets as a nod toThe Handmaid’s Tale, a man carried a sign saying, “GO HOME YOU RACIST COCKWOMBLE.” A group of a dozen people in green gowns with white sashes pulled a display case inside of which was a wax model of Oprah Winfrey wearing a campaign rosette. “OPRAH FOR PRESIDENT 2020,” the case read, and in smaller letters, “IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, BREAK GLASS.”"
I Talked to Zionists—Then I Was Disinvited by a Major Muslim Group,2018-05-30,TheAtlantic,['Wajahat Ali'],"On Tuesday, I was disinvited from the 55th annual conference of the Islamic Society of North America, which proclaims itself one of the leading American Muslim organizations. My crimes? Talking to Zionists, writing an article about it, and thanking God for a bowel movement.In a one-page letter, the program committee chair wrote that “our Muslim speakers” are “expected to support broadly our values,” including “our community’s support for the Palestinian people of all faith traditions, in their struggle against occupation and dispossession.” He added that he found my “recent work … troubling.” He also objected to my “continued use of language referencing Allah in manners not befitting His Majesty, whether in jest or otherwise.”The proximate trigger for the letter appears to have been my story inThe Atlantic’s June issue, “A Muslim Among the Settlers.” But it marks the culmination of a years-long campaign by some online activists and religious leaders to limit the range of voices at such events.The controversy stems from my involvement with the Shalom Hartman Institute and its Muslim Leadership Initiative—a program that promotes engagement between American Muslims and Jewish scholars, both in Israel and in New York City, to learn how diverse Jewish communities debate and discuss Israel, Zionism, and Judaism."
Nikki Haley’s Concern for Human Rights Only Went So Far,2018-10-09,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"During her confirmation hearing to be President Donald Trump’s envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley told U.S. senators, “I will never shy away from calling out other countries for actions taken in conflict with U.S. values and in violation of human rights and international norms.” For the most part, Haley, who announced Tuesday that she would step down at the end of the year, held true to that commitment.Yet at the same time, she was unsparing when the issue of human rights conflicted with American policy or that of its allies, as it did when she announced in June that the United States was withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council because of, among other things, its “chronic bias against Israel.”Akshaya Kumar, the deputy UN director at Human Rights Watch, told me that Haley seemed to justify her decision to pull the United States out in narrow terms, making it “basically all about Israel, ignoring the good work the council does all around the world.” “We’ve seen her very willing to embrace rights-based rhetoric on issues like Iran, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, even South Sudan or Congo, but then ... shying away from it when it’s geopolitically inconvenient like in a place like Yemen or even Iraq or Syria,” Kumar said."
The Forgotten Supreme Court Justice Who Could Save American Politics,2016-06-03,TheAtlantic,['Jeffrey Rosen'],"Louis Brandeis, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court exactly 100 years ago, was America’s greatest critic of bigness since Thomas Jefferson. Denouncing big banks as well as big government as symptoms of what he called a “curse of bigness,” Brandeis was determined to diminish concentrated financial and federal power, which he viewed as a menace to liberty and democracy. He is also the Jeffersonian prophet who has been most consistently vindicated. The “people’s lawyer,” who predicted the stock-market crash of 1929, was a ferocious critic of economic and political consolidation in an earlier age of “too big to fail.” More than any other Supreme Court justice, he shows the importance of translating values of privacy and free speech in an age of technological change.So why hasn’t Brandeis been invoked more frequently in the U.S. presidential election? Candidates from Sanders and Clinton to Ted Cruz have criticized big banks. Citizens on both sides of the aisle, from Tea Party conservatives to Feel the Bern progressives, have questioned the idea of “too big to fail.” Brandeis would seem to be a natural icon for this moment in American politics, yet politicians today rarely draw on his legacy.Part of the reason may be that Americans live in a Hamiltonian world—and not only thanks to the hit musical. Liberals and conservatives today attack either big business, like Sanders and Clinton, or big government, like Cruz, but not both. By contrast, Brandeis was the leader of a Jeffersonian tradition that is as distinctive in the 21st century as it was during the New Deal era: He was a progressive champion of federalism and the first person to characterize states as “laboratories of democracy,” a phrase that has become a touchstone of libertarians and conservatives today. At the same time, Brandeis also criticized big business. In his view, only in small communities could citizens develop their faculties of reason through the rigorous self-education he believed was necessary for full participation in American democracy.Brandeis waited 125 days between his nomination to the Supreme Court on January 28, 1916, and his confirmation on June 1. The anniversary is significant as America confronts not only a hotly contested Supreme Court vacancy but also a momentous presidential election that has unleashed angry forces of economic populism. Brandeis’s long wait for a confirmation hearing reflected, above all, the fierce opposition he attracted from J.P. Morgan and other financial oligarchs who helped cause the crash of 1929 and whose successors at the House of Morgan also helped cause the crash of 2007."
What We Talk About When We Talk About Israel,2022-07-15,TheAtlantic,['Matti Friedman'],"In search of atmosphereand inspiration as I contemplated Walter Russell Mead’s magisterialnew bookabout Israel and Jews in the American imagination, I took the bus from my street in Jerusalem across town to the American Colony. Founded in 1881 by fervent Protestants from Chicago, the colony was one of several attempts by 19th-century Americans to settle the Holy Land. Part of the idea was to induce Jews to take up farming by education or example, thus sparking a Jewish restoration that would in turn bring the Second Coming of Christ. But what made sense in Illinois made less sense in Ottoman Palestine, and the believers ultimately had to admit that real Jews weren’t particularly interested. Today the messianic compound is a luxury hotel.The American Colony, where I’m writing these lines on a table in the courtyard, is one physical incarnation of the thesis ofThe Arc of a Covenant: The United States, Israel, and the Fate of the Jewish People. Mead, a distinguished professor of foreign affairs, columnist, and author, would like to take us on a tour not of Israel but of the manifestations of Israel in the American mind—an even weirder place than the actual country where I live and report."
The Imprisoned Egyptian Activist Who Never Stopped Campaigning for His Country’s Future,2022-05-14,TheAtlantic,['Yasmine El Rashidi'],"In the summer of 2011, several months after the protest-led ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, I participated in a program on Al Jazeera’s English-language channel calledThe Café. The setup was intended to mirror the atmosphere of street-side cafés in Egypt at the time, animated with the political debates and newfound openness that the revolution had brought about. Eight of us took part, representing various walks of life and different points along the political spectrum, and we filmed over several hours at an actual café some 10 minutes from Tahrir Square. The most prominent among us was Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a blogger, a computer programmer, and an activist who is currently imprisoned in Cairo’s notorious Tora Prison.Over the past 10 years, the majority of which has seen Alaa (who is a friend) imprisoned or on probation, he has been writing—essays, newspaper columns, letters, Facebook posts, tweets—and his works have now been collected inYou Have Not Yet Been Defeated. The book offers a kaleidoscopic view of his thoughts and interests, touching on topics as varied as the threat of robots taking our jobs, the conflict in Gaza,Game of Thrones(he loved it), and climate change. His descriptions of prison life in the past decade—through all of his hunger strikes, the loss of his father, the imprisonment of his sister, the birth of his son, the torture and death of prison mates—are harrowing, but his book is also an important record of the pivot points where the revolution began to lose tack, the choices made by a movement that couldn’t maintain a unified front. Alaa, who grew up in a family of activists, has been thinking and writing about human rights and democracy since he was a teenager. But he has also written about subjects such as the dangers of capitalism and powerful tech companies’ impact on citizens—all part of his effort to envision what a sustainable and equitable society, built on the strong foundations of a shared democratic culture, might look like."

Hamas’s Hostage-Taking Handbook Says to ‘Kill the Difficult Ones’ and Use Hostages as ‘Human Shields’,2023-10-19,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"A hostage-taking manual that an official in the Israel Defense Forces told me was recovered in the aftermath of the Hamas attack suggests that the group’s hostage-taking on October 7 did not go according to plan. Right now, more than 200 hostages are thought to be in Hamas’s hands in Gaza. The manual suggests that the group at first intended not to spirit all of them into Gaza, but instead to take them hostage where they were found inside Israel, possibly for a protracted standoff.The Atlanticobtained a copy of the manual from an IDF official, who vouched for its authenticity and who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the materials. Israeli President Isaac Herzog had earlier referred to the document in an interview on CNN, calling it “an instruction guide, how to go into civilian areas, into a kibbutz, a city, amoshav[agricultural co-op].” He said it described “exactly how to torture them, how to abduct them, how to kidnap them.”The hostage-taking, according to the manual, is meant to happen “in the field,” in areas that have been “cleansed” and brought under control. After the hostages are brought together, it says, they should be culled (“kill those expected to resist and those that pose a threat”); the others should be bound and blindfolded, then “reassured,” to keep them docile. “Use them as human shields,” it says, and use “electric shocks” to force compliance."
What Another Round of Netanyahu Will Mean for American Jews,2019-04-08,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"Benjamin Netanyahu’s main opponents have tried to use an unusual weapon against the longtime prime minister ahead of a defining Israeli election set for Tuesday: They’ve argued that he has damaged the relationship between Israel and diaspora Jews.For some American Jews, the strong alliance between Netanyahu and Donald Trump of the past few years has added stress to their relationship with Israel, which has become especially fraught in the years since the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in the early 2000s. While some Jews in the U.S. appreciate Trump’s positions on Israel, many detest the American president’s domestic politics and believe that he has enabled anti-Semitism and xenophobia. And while segments of the self-identified pro-Israel community in the U.S. resolutely support anything that the Israeli prime minister does, some have been wary of Netanyahu’s alliance with right-wing forces, and disappointed by what they see as his failure to facilitate religious pluralism. Tuesday’s major election in Israel marks a high point of strain in the relationship between at least some American Jews and Israel, which has changed radically in the past generation.To understand the American Jewish relationship with Israel, it’s helpful to divide American Jews into three rough categories. On the right lies the self-described pro-Israel crowd, many of whom are Republicans, and many of whom are deeply religious. For the most part, this group would cheer another round of Netanyahu. Among modern-Orthodox Jews, for example, “the relationship is incredibly strong—it’s as strong as ever,” Nathan Diament, the executive director of the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center, told me. Part of this connection is sociological; these Jews often travel to Israel, have family there, and send their children there to study.  Some in this group don’t believe it’s their place to criticize Israeli policy. “We should be deferential to the decisions that the democratically elected leaders in Israel make about Israel’s security,” Diament said. “They’re the ones whose lives are on the line, and they’re the ones whose kids are serving in the [Israel Defense Forces].”"

The ‘Israel Model’ Won’t Work for Ukraine,2023-07-13,TheAtlantic,['Eliot A. Cohen'],"At the Vilnius summit, the United States and Germany have led the coalition of the squeamish in opposition to announcing a timetable for Ukrainian membership in NATO. They have some modestly plausible reasons, including fear of an automatic commitment to immediate war with Russia and reluctance to bring in a country whose territory is still partially occupied and whose institutions are not fully reformed.Other arguments suggest a less thoughtful view. Ukraine has to show that it can handle modern military technology, or that it is a thriving democracy? Compare it with militarily negligible and politically contemptible Hungary, and the absurdity of these kinds of requirements becomes clear. One might infer from some official pronouncements that NATO membership is like joining a snooty club to which only those with good pedigree, clean shirt collars, and immaculately shined shoes need apply. It is not. NATO membership for Ukraine is a guarantee of Western (and not only Ukrainian) security and stability. It is not a favor to Ukraine but a move to avert another big European war.The notion that NATO membership cannot be given to a country at war means that Russia has every incentive to keep the war simmering, no matter the cost. Similarly, the idea that a country that is partly occupied and whose borders are not universally recognized cannot be admitted will cause Russia to cling desperately to any piece of Ukrainian territory it can hold. Let it be noted that Germany joined NATO while under occupation by both the Soviet Union and the Western allies, and before it had acceded to its post-1945 borders."
Zelensky Has an Answer for DeSantis,2023-03-20,TheAtlantic,['Anne Applebaum'],"Imagine that someone—perhaps a man from Florida, or maybe even a governor of Florida—criticizedAmerican support for Ukraine. Imagine that this person dismissed the war between Russia and Ukraine as a purely local matter, of no broader significance. Imagine that this person eventolda far-right television personality that “while the U.S. has many vital national interests ... becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.” How would a Ukrainian respond? More to the point, how would the leader of Ukraine respond?As it happens, an opportunity to ask that hypothetical question recently availed itself. The chair of the board of directors ofThe Atlantic, Laurene Powell Jobs;The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg; and I interviewed President Volodymyr Zelensky several days ago in the presidential palace in Kyiv. In the course of an hour-long conversation, Goldberg asked Zelensky what he would say to someone, perhaps a governor of Florida, who wonders why Americans should help Ukraine."
A Shocked and Frazzled Collective Mind,2023-10-08,TheAtlantic,['Ruby Namdar'],"I will never forget that mild, golden early-October day almost exactly 50 years ago: the jarring sound of the sirens that tore into the otherworldly silence of Yom Kippur, the day of atonement; the ultra-Orthodox men, still wrapped in their snow-white High Holiday robes and fringed prayer shawls, riding on army jeeps that drove them to their volunteer positions in hospitals and military morgues—an inconceivable sight. But the most unsettling memory is of the famous speech that the prime minister, Golda Meir, delivered that evening on Israeli television, her voice trembling, her appearance bewildered. I was only 9, but I will never forget the fear in the eyes of the grown-ups. We were gathered around the clunky, old-fashioned TV set in my grandmother’s house in Jerusalem, and there was the distinct feeling that they were no longer in control of reality, that they themselves were like lost children.Waking up yesterday and glancing at my cellphone to see what was new in the world, learning about the horrific attack that Hamas had launched against so many civilians in the south of Israel, sent me straight back to that day, to the boy I was then. Shock, bewilderment, a slight nausea, a sudden urge to fight back the tears that welled in my eyes. The frightened look on the face of my parents and my aunts and uncles was the first thing that came to my mind—but now I, we, all Israelis, were those frightened grown-ups who’d lost the sense of control over our reality."
A Prayer for Peace in Bethlehem,2016-12-24,TheAtlantic,['Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian'],"Vera Baboun was 24 years old when she first realized that her hometown was truly different from other cities in the world.Her childhood in Bethlehem had seemed normal, even idyllic. Born in 1963, Baboun attended a Christian school, sang in the church choir, and played tennis. Each December, she would watch the city’s Christmas-tree lighting. As a Girl Scout, she volunteered with the annual procession of the patriarchs, an Orthodox Christian tradition that occurs a few days before Christmas each year. She married young, in her early 20s.But in 1987, tensions in Palestine exploded in what became known as theFirst Intifada, an uprising against Israeli control over parts of the territories. That was when Baboun first experienced the meaning of occupation in a deeply personal way. Her husband was detained in 1990 as part of the political resistance. His health deteriorated, but he remained in detention until 1993. In 2000, Baboun told me, the Israeli army demolished his place of work, part of a punitive practice targeting Palestinians that the U.S.-based NGO Human Rights Watch hascondemned."
The Theory of Hamas’s Catastrophic Success,2023-11-03,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"Updated at 9:50 a.m. ET on November 6, 2023Three daysafter Hamas’s attack on Israel, Icalledthe operation a “catastrophic success.” Now Hamas itself is saying something similar. A strangereportinMiddle East Eye(a publication funded by Hamas-friendly Qatar) quotes Hamas leaders admitting that they intended to commit heinous war crimes, but not at this scale. Hamas “had in mind to take between 20 and 30 hostages,” a source told the reporter. “They had not bargained on the collapse of [Israel’s] Gaza Division. This produced a much bigger result.”By “bigger result,” the source presumably meant the murder, torture, and dismemberment of more than 1,400 Israelis, Thais, Nepalis, and others. Another bigger-than-anticipated result might be the invasion of Gaza. Had the dead and kidnapped numbered in the dozens, Israel would have had to consider its options. Once Hamas broke the three- and then four-digit barriers, Israel’s commitment to destroy Hamas completely became inevitable. Hamas’s main military benefactor, Iran, tends to mount attacksjustunder the threshold of causing all-out war. That pattern keeps the geopolitical consequences manageable. Hamas’s attack crossed that line."
The Fight Over Ilhan Omar Is a Fight Over the Identity of the Democratic Party,2019-03-07,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to condemn anti-Semitism, along with a litany of bigotries against Muslims, immigrants, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, LGBT people, and members of other religious minorities. The resolution followed a week of drama in the Democratic Party, with members clashing over yet another controversial comment on Israel by Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. In a recent panel discussion, she suggested that pro-Israel political groups in Washington “push allegiance to a foreign country,” seeming to echo the classically anti-Semitic allegation that Jews are more loyal to other Jews or to Israel than to the United States.Thursday’s resolution was an attempt at compromise between House members who believe Omar has repeatedly dabbled in anti-Semitic tropes, and those who feel she has been unfairly berated for criticizing and singled out because she is black and Muslim. The resolution specifically condemns intimations of dual loyalty wielded against Jews in discussion about Israel, along with similar accusations made against Muslims in the wake of 9/11. This week, a poster connecting Omar to the September 11 terrorist attackswas displayed outside the West Virginia House of Delegatesduring a state GOP event."
The Lessons Israel Failed to Learn From the Yom Kippur War,2023-10-13,TheAtlantic,"['Keren Yarhi-Milo, Tim Naftali']","The parallels areblindingly and painfully obvious. A surprise attack against an Israel caught largely unaware; an invading military force; the timing, a holy day in early October; the victims, an unsuspecting population forced to scramble for underground bomb shelters and mobilize for war; the mistakes by an intelligence apparatus that is the envy of the world.But the surprise attack that took place in Israel this past weekend is arguably worse than the one that launched the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Hamas, a guerrilla organization that controls the Gaza Strip, has already killed many more Israeli civilians in the first days of this war than Egypt and Syria, sovereign nations with national armies, killed during the October war 50 years ago. Hamas struck targets deep inside Israeli towns. The magnitude and sophistication of this past weekend’s attacks—carried out in multiple locations and involving thousands of fighters—imply that this offensive was in the works for several months, if not longer. And intelligence gathering should have been easier in Gaza, where Israel is reputed to have massive surveillance systems, than it was in Egypt and Syria in the early 1970s. How could Israel have missed the planning of this assault?The first explanations put forth by experts and journalists suggest that the problem was largely a matter of intelligence collection. Perhaps Israel over-relied on signals intelligence and other electronic sources, and Hamas learned to circumvent detection—for example, byusing dronesto disable systems along the border. Another possibility is that Israel lacked enough, or credible enough, human intelligence sources within the inner circle of Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, or access to the plans of its military commander, Mohammed Deif. In 1973, the Israelis had a highly placed human source: the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s son-in-law, Ashraf Marwan, who was also a close adviser to President Anwar Sadat. A third theory is that Israeli intelligence was distracted by a multitude of threats; much of the Israeli military was stationed near the West Bank before this weekend’s attack. Finally, Hamas might have used deception, lulling Jerusalem into assuming the group was willing to live with Israel’s normalization of relations with Arab countries. In 1973, the Egyptians used a regularly scheduled military exercise to cover up their war preparations.But intelligence failures can also be the product of a failure of imagination. The disorganization and slowness of Israel’s response on Saturday strongly suggest that the country’s political and military leaders might suffer from the same psychological misconceptions that Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and her advisers—and some in the U.S. government—did in 1973. In both instances, Israel’s leaders appear to have misread their Arab adversaries, grossly underestimating their enemies’ propensity for taking risks and overestimating their own deterrent capability. These mental shortcomings can blind a modern intelligence service, no matter its level of sophistication, and the government it serves. A look back at what went wrong in October 1973, using some materials released in the past decade, provides useful historical context for thinking about the shock of last weekend."
Why Israel Should Obey Geneva Even When Its Enemies Do Not,2023-10-27,TheAtlantic,['Michael Ignatieff'],"We are againwitnessing what a world without pity looks like. The invasion of Ukraine; Russia’s murder of civilians in Bucha; Hamas killers filming themselves murdering women, children, and retirees in kibbutz gardens; the pulverization of Gaza and mass civilian casualties. We’ve been catapulted backwards into the lawless universe Bruegel painted centuries ago in hisMassacre of the Innocents.When the internationally sanctionedsystem of rules collapses, the legal and ethical norms that regulate individual conduct begin to founder. Justifications of violence are hurled around, with all the righteousness that goes with identity claims and group loyalty. Mere bystanders rush to judgment in service of their prior political certainties.Amid this moral storm, we have one piece of wreckage to cling to. The Geneva Conventions still figure prominently on both sides of the propaganda battle over the current conflict in Gaza, suggesting that they still have some vestigial authority. Hamas’s supporters cite these laws of war to justify its actions, and to claim that Israel violates the rules. For its part, Israel insists that it abides by them, because its military lawyers and commanders adhere to principles of proportionality and discretion, and take measures to avoid civilian casualties."
No One Is Coming to Help the Palestinians,2021-05-16,TheAtlantic,['Kim Ghattas'],"“Today Iran, tomorrow Palestine.” Thus cheered the crowd in Tehran in February 1979, during the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s visit to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini just days after the success of the Iranian revolution. Arafat was the first foreign dignitary to visit Iran after the fall of the shah. For him, Khomeini’s success was a win for the Palestinian cause: His guerrilla fighters had helped train Iranian revolutionaries in Lebanon, and he was hopeful that, with Khomeini’s help, he would soon be on his way to establishing a Palestinian state.This fascinating and relatively little-known episode in the Middle East’s history altered the region’s political landscape, and still informs the context in which today’s events in the Palestinian territories and Israel are unfolding. Although the personal relationship between Arafat and Khomeini soured within a year, their encounter marks the moment when revolutionary Iran’s involvement with the Palestinians began, and when the Palestinian issue inserted itself into a then-still-nascent regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran."
Biden Will Be Guided by His Zionism,2023-10-10,TheAtlantic,['Franklin Foer'],"Updated at 4:28 p.m. ET on October 10, 2023On Sunday morning, Joe Biden got on the phone with Benjamin Netanyahu. After the barbaric attack launched against Israel the day before, the Israeli prime minister was able to offer a granular account of what was already known about the unfolding catastrophe. According to two Biden-administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, he gave Biden a vivid set of details about the assault on the music festival in the south of his country. The death toll, he reported, was well over 200—part of the more than 800 Israelis already reported killed in the Hamas assault. Netanyahu’s anger and despair poured through the phone.Biden and Netanyahu have known each other since the 1980s. Their shared history includes navigating rocket attacks, terrorist assaults, and ground wars. But the president’s aides reported that Biden instantly understood Hamas’s invasion to be different in scale and kind than anything in his political memory, and Netanyahu’s raw account of the carnage stoked Biden’s feelings of anger."
Students for Pogroms in Israel,2023-10-14,TheAtlantic,['Conor Friedersdorf'],"Campus politics in America irrevocably changed this week when student groups that champion the noble goal of justice for Palestinians endorsed the evil means of war crimes in pursuit of it.Last Saturday, hundreds of gun-toting men stormed into Israel by land, air, and sea with the express purpose of killing as many Jews as possible. They succeeded in perpetrating a pogrom reminiscent of the Cossacks and the Nazis. They murdered civilians in their homes as their families watched. They massacred young people at a music festival. They kidnapped children.Across America, millions of people with wildly diverse opinions on the longstanding conflict between Israel and Palestine denounced those atrocities, because it is always wrong to deliberately target and slaughter civilians and it is always wrong to abduct, let alone kill, children.I naively believed that those were near-consensus beliefs on college campuses––that whether one sided with Israelis or Palestinians in the long and heartrending conflict between them, almost everyone could agree that certain actions were evil regardless of who took them. Then this week, on dozens of campuses, student groups reacted to the attacks by attempting to absolve the murderers and child abductors of all responsibility."
Why Trump Threatened to Close Palestine's D.C. Headquarters,2017-11-21,TheAtlantic,['Grant Rumley'],"This week, the Trump administrationthreatenedto close the Washington office of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) if the Palestinians did not immediately halt their campaign at the International Criminal Court (ICC) and agree to engage in the soon-to-be announced peace process. In response, the PLOannouncedtoday that it would halt all contacts with American officials. Though the Palestinians joined the ICC over two years ago—and have yet to successfully bring a case against an Israeli—it was Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas’scommentsat the UN General Assembly in September in which he called on the ICC to “open an investigation” and prosecute Israeli officials, that reportedly were a bridge too far for the Trump administration.The crisis comes at a delicate time. The White House is hoping to re-launch peace talks soon with a to-be-announced program, one that it hopes will capitalize on Israel’s growingrelationswith the broader Arab world. An important component of this regional architecture—for the Arab world—is progress on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Whether this latest crisis is simply bureaucratic or an attempt to pressure the Palestinians into accepting the White House’s plans, Abbas’s response is still the same. He will resist external pressure, dig in his heels, and double down on his international campaign."
"Pete Davidson Might Be the Comedic Hero We Need Now. No, Really.",2023-10-15,TheAtlantic,['Hannah Giorgis'],"The firstSaturday Night Liveepisode since the end of the months-longwriters’ strikestarted with a somber message from the series alum Pete Davidson. He began hiscold openby referencing “the horrible images and stories from Israel and Gaza,” then quickly addressed the elephant in Studio 8H: “I know what you’re thinking—who better to comment on it than Pete Davidson?”But however preposterous that premise might sound, Davidson’s cold open and his later monologue made the case for what entertainers—and comedians, especially—can offer audiences in moments of crisis. The 29-year-old comic reminded viewers that his own life had been shaped by a violent attack: When he was 7, Davidson lost his father, a firefighter who died on 9/11. “I saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering—Israeli children and Palestinian children—and it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place,” he said."
Iran’s Economy Is Struggling Even Without U.S. Sanctions,2018-08-06,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"Updated at 10:30 a.m. ETThe first set of U.S. sanctions on Iran prompted by the Trump administration’s withdrawal last May from the nuclear agreement goes into effect Monday, adding to pressure on the already hobbled Iranian economy.The sanctions target important elements of Iran’s economy, but they are comparatively less severe than the restrictions that go into effect on November 4. Those sanctions target the Islamic Republic’s oil industry, on which Iran’s economy is heavily dependent.The reimposition of sanctions formalizes America’s withdrawal from the Iran deal, under which Iran agreed to curb elements of its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. But if sanctions relief was supposed to help cure Iran’s economy, it didn’t work out that way. The country has been under severe economic strain even without the sanctions—which are sure to make it worse.“The Iranian economy was already on a downward spiral before the president made his decision and that’s the result of the policies that Iran has espoused for quite some time,” a senior administration official said Monday in a conference call with reporters. “But there’s no question that these financial sanctions are going to continue to bring significant financial pressure.”"
The Day After Netanyahu,2023-11-10,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"It was October 7, and men with guns were hunting Nir Gontarz’s son. Amir, age 23, had been at the music festival that was ambushed by Hamas terrorists from the air. Now he was on the run, sending panicked messages to his father. A professional journalist, Nir tried calling the usual sources for help—politicians, the army, the police. He soon realized that no rescue was coming. Then, scrolling through live updates from the scene of the slaughter on social media, he saw a photograph of someone he thought might be able to help.Yair Golan, a 61-year-old ex-general and former leftist politician, had no business being in the war zone. But there he was, on site, in his old uniform. In desperation, Nir called Golan’s mobile and explained his son’s predicament. The general’sresponse: “Send me his location and I will bring him to you.” Half an hour later, Nir received another clipped message: “Link-up in one minute. Don’t worry.” Nir’s son was safe."
Netanyahu Is Fighting Ghosts,2019-03-08,TheAtlantic,['Yossi Klein Halevi'],"The Likud campaign ad opens with a 1999 victory rally of newly elected Labor Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who promises cheering supporters “a new dawn,” bringing the Oslo peace process to its successful conclusion. Cut to the image of a bombed bus. An ominous voice-over reminds Israelis that instead of peace, “we received the intifada,” four years of the worst terrorism in Israel’s history. “We must not repeat that mistake.” Then the names of the leaders of the new centrist party, Blue and White—Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid—appear on screen: “Lapid and Gantz. Left. Weak.”It might seem odd that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud Party are focusing on events that are two decades old and invoking a long-discredited and irrelevant Labor Party leader. But the Likud understands what much of the international community never internalized: that the second intifada—which began in 2000, shortly after Barak accepted the principle of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and which resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries among Israelis and Palestinians—remains the great Israeli trauma of this generation."
Benjamin Netanyahu’s Me-or-the-Abyss Allure,2018-11-22,TheAtlantic,['Gregg Carlstrom'],"Once again, Benjamin Netanyahu seems to have outsmarted his rivals.Last week, Israel and Gazacame to the brink of warafter a botched operation by Israeli commandos that killed seven Palestinian militants. The militants subsequently fired more than 400 rockets and mortars in a 24-hour period; Israeli jets responded with scores of air strikes. But the Israeli prime minister defied public pressure to hit back harder, and instead accepted a deeply unpopular cease-fire with Hamas. Avigdor Lieberman, Israel’s malevolently cartoonish but politically savvy defense minister, sensed an opportunity. He accused Netanyahu of a “surrender to terror” in Gaza and resigned,leavingthe prime minister with a razor-thin, one-seat majority and facing calls for early elections.Rather than going on the defensive, Netanyahu pressed forward. He kept the defense ministry for himself, adding to his modest workload: He also serves as foreign minister and head of government. And he invoked the memory of 1992, when right-wing parties toppled a conservative government. Yitzhak Rabin soon became prime minister and signed the Oslo Accords. Netanyahu urged his partners not to repeat that “historic mistake,” lest they endanger Israel’s existential security and the supposedly tenuous rule of the right. (His Likud party has governed Israel for most of the past two decades, but acts as if it is constantly on the brink of defeat.)"
Most Arab Leaders Won't Care Much About the Jerusalem Announcement,2017-12-06,TheAtlantic,['Shadi Hamid'],"Most Arab countries won’t care much about Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, which might seem counterintuitive. Theofficial announcement, though, comes at an important and peculiar time, when Arab regimes—particularly Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt—find themselves more aligned than ever with Israel on regional priorities. They all share, along with the Trump administration, a near obsession with Iran as the source of the region’s evils; a dislike, and even hatred, of theMuslim Brotherhood; and an opposition to the intent and legacy of the Arab Spring.The Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has developed a close relationship with Trump senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whorecently outlinedthe administration’s Middle East vision at my institution, Brookings). If Saudi officials, including the crown prince himself, were particularly concerned with Jerusalem’s status, they would presumably have used their privileged status as a top Trump ally and lobbied the administration to hold off on such a needlessly toxic move. As my colleague Shibley Telhamiargues, there was little compelling reason, in either foreign policy or domestic political terms, for Trump to do this. This is a gratuitous announcement, if there ever was one, and it’s unlikely Trump would have followed through if the Saudis had drawn something resembling a red line, so to speak."
"In the Middle East, Progress Without Peace",2018-11-01,TheAtlantic,"['Aaron David Miller, Hillel Zand']","Flanked by his wife, his national-security adviser, and the head of the Mossad, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a surprise visit last week to Oman and met with its leader, Sultan Qaboos bin Said.Beyond the headline is a stunningly paradoxical trend line: The most significant period of Israeli-Arab de facto cooperation since the last real peace process, in the 1990s, is now taking place without one. Netanyahu and his right-wing government are reversing the notion that only peace with the Palestinians can ensure Israel’s acceptance into an angry and hostile Arab world. The Arab street may still oppose Israel, but Arab leaders clearly don’t.Netanyahu isn’t the first Israeli prime minister to meet Qaboos at home. Yitzhak Rabin had that honor in 1994. And while the current spate of Israeli-Arab activity is nowhere near the salad days of the 1990s in the wake of the Oslo Accords, the extent of Israeli contacts both above and below the table are impressive, especially because it’s the hard-line Netanyahu running the show and not the moderate Rabin."
The Cost of War Will Be Counted in Children’s Lives,2023-10-26,TheAtlantic,['Catherine Russell'],"The true cost of the violence in Gaza and Israel will be measured in children’s lives—those lost to the violence and those forever changed by it.Less than three weeks on from the horrific attack inside Israel and the start of daily bombings of the Gaza Strip, the devastating tally in Israel and Gaza is quickly adding up. More than 2,700 Palestinian children have been killed and nearly 6,000 injured, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, for a shocking average of more than 480 child casualties per day.More than 30 Israeli children have reportedly been killed, while at least 20 remain hostage in the Gaza Strip, their fates unknown.Sadly, more suffering and death are on the horizon.Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on Earth—home to more than 2 million people, nearly half of whom are children. More than 1 million people in the north have been warned to move south, ahead of what is expected to be a wide-scale military operation. But with near-constant shelling, closed borders, and little room for movement, they have nowhere truly safe to go."
The AI Debate Is Happening in a Cocoon,2023-11-09,TheAtlantic,"['Amba Kak, Sarah Myers West']","Much of the time, discussions about artificial intelligence are far removed from the realities of how it’s used in today’s world. Earlier this year, executives at Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and other AI companiesdeclared in a joint letterthat “mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war.” In the lead-up to the AI summit that he recently convened, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunakwarnedthat “humanity could lose control of AI completely.” Existential risks—or x-risks, as they’re sometimes known in AI circles—evoke blockbuster science-fiction movies and play to many people’s deepest fears.But AI already poses economic and physical threats—ones that disproportionately harm society’s most vulnerable people. Some individuals have been incorrectlydenied health-care coverage,orkept in custodybased on algorithms thatpurport to predict criminality. Human life is explicitly at stake in certain applications of artificial intelligence, such as AI-enabledtarget-selection systemslike those theIsraeli military has used in Gaza. In other cases, governments and corporations have used artificial intelligence to disempower members of the public and conceal their own motivations in subtle ways: in unemployment systems designed toembed austerity politics; in worker-surveillance systemsmeant to erode autonomy; in emotion-recognition systems that, despite being based on flawed science,guide decisionsabout whom to recruit and hire."
A Humanist Manifesto,2023-10-24,TheAtlantic,['David Brooks'],"One eveningnot long ago, I was doomscrolling on social media, wading through the detritus of our present moment: Videos of terrorists in Israel decapitating a man with a garden hoe. A clip of Donald Trump being cruel and narcissistic. Footage of mobs physically assaulting some lone stranger they disagree with, pummeling him as he lies prone on the ground.These are all products of the rising tide of dehumanization that has swept across the world. The famous dates of our century point to this great unfolding of barbarism—September 11, 2001; January 6, 2021; October 7, 2023. The causes of this rising culture of dehumanization are almost too many to count: tribalism, racism, ideological dogmatism, social media. All this amounts to the steady evisceration of the moral norms that can make our planet a decent place to live—and their gradual substitution with distrust, aggression, and rage. Dehumanization is any way of seeing and acting that covers the human face, that refuses to recognize and respect the full dignity of each person.Then, as I was scrolling, I came upon a short video of an interview that the author James Baldwin gave many decades ago. “There may not be as much humanity in the world as one would like to see, but there is some,” he said. “There is more than one would think.” He spoke with gravity and moral conviction, his eyes boring into the interviewer, who was off-camera. “Walk down the street of any city, any afternoon, and look around you,” he continued. “What you’ve got to remember is what you’re looking at is also you. Everyone you’re looking at is also you. You could be that person. You could be that monster, you could be that cop. And you have to decide for yourself not to be.”"
Elon Musk Among the Anti-Semites,2023-05-16,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"Updated at 9:18 a.m. ET on May 17, 2023.Last night, Elon Musk made two rookie social-media mistakes: He tweeted after 10 p.m., and he echoed paranoid anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists. “George Soros reminds me of Magneto,” hedeclared, likening the financier to the Marvel supervillain, both of them Jewish Holocaust survivors. In case the meaning was unclear, Musk quicklyclarifiedto another user, “He wants to erode the very fabric of civilization. Soros hates humanity.”Criticizing George Soros is not inherently anti-Semitic. He is one of the world’s richest men and most influential philanthropists, as well as the Democratic Party’slargest single donor, and hisviewsundoubtedly warrant scrutiny and debate. But Musk was not taking issue with a particular statement or position put forward by Soros; he was presenting him as an avatar of evil. He painted Soros as a literal comic-book villain."

Trump’s Only Real Worldview Is Pettiness,2023-10-13,TheAtlantic,['David A. Graham'],"Let no one say that Donald Trump has lost his edge. His speech Wednesday evening, amid the roiling violence in the Gaza Strip, shows he’s still got it, whatever it is.In Florida, the former president and GOP presidential front-runnerblastedIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a supposed disagreement over a 2020 U.S. missile strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. “I’ll never forget,” Trump said. “I’ll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing.”He went on to praise Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that is allied with Hamas and Iran. “You know, Hezbollah is very smart. They’re all very smart.”Trump understood that the comments would be buzzy and predicted that the press would freak out, but the more notable blowback came from other quarters. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, one of Trump’s top rivals, attacked him. “Now is not the time to be attacking our ally,” he said. “Trump puts himself first.” Other conservative leadersalso reacted with disgust. Trump’s campaign, feeling the heat, put out a statement yesterdayinsisting, “There was no better friend or ally of Israel than President Donald J.

The Thin Line Between War and Peace in Gaza,2018-05-30,TheAtlantic,['David Kenner'],"Apart from the destruction and death and sometimes paralyzing fear, one memory sticks in my mind from reporting in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip during the 2014 war with Israel. It occurred on the terrace of Gaza City’s al-Dera hotel, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. A few days earlier, an Israeli airstrikehad killedfour young boys playing soccer on the beach below the terrace, in full view of the assembled foreign press corps. This day, my translator, a middle-aged Palestinian man, looked out at the sea and sighed: “The Israelis are going about this all wrong.”There was nothing to live for in Gaza, he said. People couldn’t earn a salary, couldn’t get married and start a family, and constantly feared dying just as senselessly as those boys on the beach below. Life was hard in the West Bank, to be sure—but Palestinians had enough to lose that they thought twice about heading down the road to war.Four years later, the line between war and peace in Gaza remains paper thin. Of the dozens of mortars fired into Israel on Tuesday, one in particular served as a stark reminder of this fact: The shell came crashing down near a kindergarten in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Ein Hashlosha in the early morning hours before children had arrived. If it had landed in the same spot a half hour later, as parents milled around at the beginning of the school day with their sons and daughters, Israel and Hamas would likely be at war today."
The West Is Failing Belarus,2021-05-26,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"When the Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko plucked a dissident journalist out of the sky, he proved two things: that his 27-year grip on power is unhindered by international isolation, and that, absent meaningful action by the United States and Europe—whose citizens were among the passengers on the hijacked flight—nothing is going to change.That, at least, is how Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya sees it. “Since December, we haven’t had any sanctions; we haven’t had any high-profile meetings,” the Belarusian opposition leader and self-styled leader of democratic Belarus told me from her office in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius, where the Ryanair flight carrying the Belarusian opposition journalist Roman Protasevich was headed. Protasevich never made it to Vilnius, though, and neither did his girlfriend—both were detained after theflight was divertedto Minsk under the ruse that the Palestinian militant group Hamas had made a bomb threat (it had not). Tsikhanouskaya took the same flight only a week ago, and she told me she would have never imagined that something like that could happen. “Maybe I could be in Roman’s place,” she said.That place is a Minsk detention center, whereProtasevich appearsto have been beaten and forced to confess to “organizing mass riots.” Tsikhanouskaya, meanwhile, remains in Vilnius, fighting the Belarusian prodemocracy movement’s corner on the world stage. Although her meetings with leaders and international bodies have reaped key wins—including widespread international refusal to recognize Lukashenko as the rightful leader of Belarus following last summer’sfraudulent presidential election, as well as U.S. and European sanctions against top Belarusian officials—they appear to have had little effect on the staying power of Europe’s last dictator. “The threat of sanctions stops [Lukashenko] from escalating violence,” Tsikhanouskaya told me during our Zoom call, “and that’s why very strong steps should be taken right now.”"
Here’s What Biden Can Do to Change His Grim Polling,2023-11-03,TheAtlantic,['David Frum'],"Why are President Joe Biden’s poll numbers so bad?Is it because of interest rates? Inflation? Crime? The border?Is it because he’s too progressive? Not progressive enough?Whatever your theory, it should take into account a curious coincidence:how closelyBiden’s approval numbers have tracked the numbers from former President Barack Obama’s first term. Obama’s numbers slumped in the second half of his third year, 2011. In the middle of that October, his disapproval number reached 41 percent, not very far off from Biden’s 37 percent at the same point in October 2023.The world of 2011 was a very different place from the world of 2023. The job market was weak, not red hot the way it is now. Immigrantswere returninghome, not arriving by the millions. China’s economy was booming, not slumping."
How One AIPAC Speech Exemplified the Democrats’ Israel Challenge,2019-03-27,TheAtlantic,['Russell Berman'],"To appreciate the predicament the Democratic Party finds itself in with respect to Israel, look no further than thespeechthat House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer delivered this week to the AIPAC conference in Washington, D.C.It was an impassioned and enthusiastically received defense of the U.S.-Israel alliance, punctuated repeatedly with rousing ovations and betraying not a sliver of daylight between the House’s second-ranking Democrat and the hawkish lobbying group. Hoyer framed his address as a barely veiled rebuttal to a freshman member of his own caucus, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, andher comments early this monththat suggested supporters of Israel were pushing “for allegiance to a foreign country.”“When someone accuses American supporters of Israel of dual loyalty, I say: Accuse me,” Hoyer thundered on Sunday evening to a crowd that organizers say numbered 18,000 people. “I am part of a large, bipartisan coalition in Congress supporting Israel—an overwhelming majority of the United States Congress. I tell Israel’s accusers and detractors: Accuse me.”Hoyer was one of several top congressional Democrats to speak at AIPAC’s sprawling annual conference, even as the party’s leading presidential contenders stayed away from the event in apparent deference to a boycott pushed by MoveOn.org. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke on Monday afternoon, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addressed the event on Tuesday afternoon. Like Hoyer, Pelosi also spoke out forcefully in support of Israel and against anti-Semitism, although her speech was more low-key in tone. “In our democratic societies, we should welcome legitimate debate about how best to honor our values and to advance our priorities without questioning loyalty or patriotism,” she said, before touting the resolution the House passed that rejected “the pernicious myth of dual loyalty and foreign allegiance.”"
Jared Kushner’s Middle East Fantasy,2018-06-25,TheAtlantic,"['Philip Gordon, Prem Kumar']","Jared Kushner, it seems, is feeling optimistic.On Sunday, in his first-ever interview with a Palestinian newspaper, the U.S. president’s son-in-law and Middle East peace envoy said that despite appearances to the contrary, “prospects for peace are very much alive” and confirmed that the administration is getting ready to release its long-awaited plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace. Asked how that plan is different from previous efforts, Kushner explained he has done “a lot of listening” and is convinced the Palestinian people are “less invested in the politicians’ talking points” than they are in seeing how a deal will improve their prospects for a better life.Given the serious risks of escalating violence, the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza, and the continued costs of the status quo, Kushner’s desire to move forward even in the face of long odds is understandable. Unfortunately, his interview also revealed that he is living in a fantasy world and preparing an approach more likely to compound the current problems than to resolve them. The assumptions on which he appears to be basing his plan—whatever its precise contents turn out to be—are so flawed that it is fair to wonder if his aim is really to start serious negotiations, or simply to please President Trump’s base by gearing up to blame the Palestinian side for the failure to come.The first fantasy is the notion that the obstruction of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas—who refused to meet with Kushner on his latest trip—can be countered by taking the peace plan “directly to the Palestinian people.” Kushner suggests that Abbas is avoiding him because he’s “scared we will release our peace plan and that the Palestinian people will actually like it.” That’s not likely. Abbas is indeed unpopular with most Palestinians—his approval rating hovers just above 30 percent—but it’s hardly because he’s too hardline on Israel. In our own extensive discussions with Abbas and his negotiating team as White House Middle East advisers during the Obama administration, we found them deterred most of all by the fear they could not sell further concessions to their people, who were seething about years of continued Israeli settlement expansion, land confiscation, and increased limits on Palestinian movement. And that problem is even greater today. In fact, more Palestiniansnow opposea two-state solution than support one, and a majority—57 percent—say that such a solution is no longer practical because of Israeli settlement expansion, which now extends deep into the West Bank. Over 35 percent of Palestinians now support a one-state solution—in other words, a single country with an Arab majority and equal rights for all—a solution increasingly appealing to Palestinians under the age of 30."
‘Jerusalem Is Not the Explosive Device—It’s the Detonator’,2017-12-05,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"JERUSALEM—Even before reportssuggestedPresident Trump will declare that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and eventually move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officials were predicting that the announcement would create chaos. By predetermining the final status of Jerusalem, Trump’s announcement would derail any hope for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and spark violent protests across the Middle East.Foreign leaders from across the Arab world have been warning the Trump administration of the potential for violence. King Abdullah II of Jordan, which has custodianship of Christian and Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem,toldU.S. lawmakers that the move could be exploited by terrorists to stoke anger in the region.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to cut diplomatic ties with Israel if the U.S. moves its embassy, and Saudi Arabia also condemned the plan. Saeb Erekat, the general secretary of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, said the move would “promote international anarchy and disrespect for global institutions and law.”But for all the warnings that Trump’s embassy announcement could cause unrest, the biggest drivers of violence are actually threats to Jerusalem’s holy sites, said Daniel Seidemann, a left-wing attorney who runs the NGO Terrestrial Jerusalem, which maps developments in the city. While he believes there’s a possibility of mass demonstrations and violence in the broader Arab world, “the threat that this is going to cause an explosion and a bloodbath on the streets of Jerusalem is misplaced,” he said. “Jerusalem is not usually the explosive device. It’s usually the detonator. There is almost invariably one thing, and one thing only, that creates that spark, and that is the real or perceived threat to sacred space.”When Jews all over the world pray, they face Israel. Those in Israel face Jerusalem, and those in Jerusalem face the Temple Mount, the site of Judaism’s two ancient sanctuaries, which once stood on the same patch of land now occupied by the Al-Aqsa mosque. “This is all because we believe this is our capital,” said Arieh King, a right-wing member of Jerusalem’s City Council. “For the Orthodox Jew like me, Jerusalem is not just a place to live. It’s a way that you live. It’s in a place close to where everything important of our history happened … also in the future, [where] we believe the third Temple will be built.”Palestinians feel just as strongly about the city’s religious significance. “Jerusalem is part of our faith. It’s the first place where Muslims started praying,” said Ziad Abu Zayyad, a lawyer and former minister of the Palestinian Authority. Not only is Jerusalem a symbol of national identity; it’s the home of one of the most important sites in Islam. “Al-Aqsa is in the heart of every Muslim,” Zayyad said. “It’s a red line. It’s the third holy place,” after the Saudi Arabian cities of Mecca and Medina."
Netanyahu Should Quit. The U.S. Can Help With That.,2023-12-07,TheAtlantic,"['Daniel Benjamin, Steven Simon']","When a nation suffers a surprise attack, the most obvious costs are the sheer loss of life and the immediate damage to national security. But another casualty can be the nation’s underlying strategic assumptions about the world it inhabits. This happened to the United States on 9/11, when terrorism went from a third-tier annoyance to the foremost security challenge the U.S. faced, and a new and little-known enemy emerged as its primary foe.In Israel, the attacks of October 7 have had a similarly devastating effect, destroying the nation’s sense that its territory was reasonably safe from a large-scale Palestinian attack and that the lack of a political settlement with the Palestinians was manageable for the indefinite future—that is, without a solution involving either two states or one binational state. The idea that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could provide security while kicking the Palestinian problem into the indefinite future, which he has been making state policy for nearly three decades, has lost all credibility. The question for Israelis is what will fill the void left by the loss of the old verities.The earthquake of October 7 therefore offers the first opportunity since the U.S. brokered the Egyptian-Israeli peace of 1979 to reshape the political landscape. October 7 was the day that a two-state solution was resurrected from the graveyard of Middle East politics, at least for the moment. With everything up for grabs, U.S. leaders can now deploy the age-old mantra that “the situation is not sustainable” without Israelis rolling their eyes and wishing the Americans would just go away. As the old diplomatic adage holds, no serious crisis should be wasted."
Hamas Must Go,2023-11-14,TheAtlantic,['Hillary Rodham Clinton'],"One morningin November 2012, I knocked on the door of President Barack Obama’s suite in the Raffles Hotel in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, so early that he was barely out of bed. I had an urgent question that could not wait for the president to finish his morning coffee: Should we try to broker a cease-fire in Gaza? Then, like now, the extreme Islamist terror group Hamas had sparked a crisis by indiscriminately attacking Israeli civilians. Israel had responded with air strikes, and a ground invasion of Gaza appeared imminent.The president and I debated whether I should leave Asia, fly to the Middle East, and try to negotiate a halt to the fighting before the situation escalated further. The reason to go was clear: Stopping the violence would save lives and prevent the conflict from spiraling into a wider regional war.The reasons not to go were more nuanced but also compelling. President Obama and I were both wary of suggesting that Israel did not have a right and a responsibility to defend itself against terrorists. If Hamas did not face consequences for its attacks, it would be emboldened to carry out more. We also knew Hamas had a history of breaking agreements and could not be trusted. For that matter, neither side seemed ready to pull back from the brink. Diplomacy is all about leverage and timing. If I tried and failed to negotiate a cease-fire, it would reduce America’s credibility in the region and lower the likelihood that we could reengage successfully later."
The End of Netanyahu’s Unchecked Reign,2019-09-19,TheAtlantic,['Natan Sachs'],"Israel’s second election of 2019 managed to produce both high drama and anticlimax. The top-line result: There is no clear winner. Neither the right-wing bloc led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, nor the center-left bloc led by former military Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, commanded a majority of the 120 seats in the 22nd Knesset. But there was still a loser of sorts: Netanyahu.The one thing thatwasclear, following the election, was that the results signal a dramatic shift in policy. Israel had stepped all the way to the brink on two fundamental issues, and it has now taken a half step back. These results scuttle Netanyahu’s plans to officially apply Israeli law to parts of the West Bank, annexing the Jordan Valley, and to curtail the Israeli Supreme Court’s powers in order to secure himself immunity from prosecution on corruption charges. Both issues would have had serious ramifications, the former for the possibility of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the future, and the latter for the health of Israeli democracy. Tuesday’s results will not produce peace nor resolve Israel’s internal challenges, but they stave off those prospects, at least for the moment.The odd thing is, had the first general elections of 2019, in April, ended with these same results, Netanyahu would have been declared the clear winner, the Supreme Court would have appeared in danger, and annexation would be on the table. In fact, the April results were, on the surface, very similar to these returns, and Netanyahu was universally proclaimed the victor, as Iwrotethe day after those elections."
The Fatal Flaw That Doomed the Oslo Accords,2018-09-14,TheAtlantic,['Einat Wilf'],"It hardly seems possible that it’s been 25 years since the signing of the Oslo Accords, that hopeful moment when peace between Palestinians and Israelis seemed at hand. In retrospect, the Accords seem less a triumph than an abject failure. Most observers, trying to understand what went wrong, fight over who to blame. The more constructive question is not who, but rather what, to blame. What doomed the Oslo Accords is also what made them possible in the first place: constructive ambiguity.Given decades of war and bloodshed, the theory went, the two sides could not be expected to immediately settle their core disputes; an interim period of trust-building was required. It was better to remain ambiguous about the core issues which needed to be resolved, the negotiators assumed, rather than force the sides to adopt positions and make concessions which they might not be ready to make.This constructive ambiguity, imbued in each element of the Accords, proved to be utterly destructive. Instead of building trust and allowing the parties to adjust to the reality of the inevitable compromises which were necessary for peace, it merely allowed each side to persist in its own self-serving interpretation of what the Accords implied and to continue the very behavior which destroyed trust on the other side. And so, when the time came, a few short years later, to settle the core issues, the ensuing failure was all but inevitable."
What Kissinger Didn’t Understand,2023-12-01,TheAtlantic,['George Packer'],"Henry Kissinger spent half a century pursuing and using power, and a second half century trying to shape history’s judgment of the first. His longevity, and the frantic activity that ceased only when he stopped breathing, felt like an interminable refusal to disappear until he’d ensured that posthumous admiration would outweigh revulsion. In the end none of it mattered. The historical record—Vietnam and Cambodia, the China opening, the Soviet détente, slaughter in Bangladesh and East Timor, peace in the Middle East, the coup in Chile—was already there. Its interpretation will not be up to him.Kissinger is a problem to be solved: the problem of a very human inhumanity. Because he was, undoubtedly, human—brilliant, insecure, funny, gossipy, curious, devious, self-deprecating, cruel. In Martin Indyk’s bookMaster of the Game, about Kissinger’s successful efforts to end the 1973 Yom Kippur War, you meet a diplomat with a deep knowledge of the region’s history and personalities, operating with great subtlety and stamina to bring about a state of equilibrium that led to peace between Israel and Egypt. If you read Gary J. Bass’sThe Blood Telegram, about the 1971 Pakistani civil war that created Bangladesh, you meet a policy maker with a shocking indifference to human life, willing to aid Pakistan in committing genocide so that Islamabad would continue to be a conduit between Washington and Beijing."
What Happened to Empathy?,2023-10-12,TheAtlantic,['Xochitl Gonzalez'],"San Francisco, I realized during a visit to the city this spring, has a people problem. Not a homeless-people problem, or a tech-people problem, but a lack-of-people problem. As I walked from my hotel in SoMa to the Embarcadero on a sunny afternoon, the emptiness of the streets felt nearly apocalyptic. Passing other humans—a fundamental circumstance of urban life elsewhere—here was so rare, it felt oddly menacing. I did pass some people who looked unwell, or dirty from living on the streets, but that’s not why I felt the way I did. The volume and density of humanity are what make cities feel safe. The pleasure and pain of a city is that we are never alone, even when we desperately want to be. That wasn’t the case in San Francisco.So I was bewildered whenI read recentlyof the city’s experiment with driverless taxicabs. During that visit, I stepped over two people who appeared to be high on fentanyl, stepped past too many boarded-up storefronts to count, and literally stepped into human excrement. Engaging with my living, breathing (and sometimes chatty) taxi and Uber drivers was absolutely the least of my troubles in San Francisco."
The Small Rebellions of Sally Rooney’s 'Normal People',2019-04-12,TheAtlantic,['Annalisa Quinn'],"Sally Rooney’s new novel,Normal People, was recently featured in aVanity Fairspread of “this season’s best new books and the must-have bags to stash them in.” In the picture, it leans confidingly against a Mansur Gavriel tote bag in a pleasing highlighter yellow (price: $595).The person who owns that combination of things would be rich, tasteful, and smart, the kind of person who has a well-paying job (creative director? brand consultant?) that still leaves her time to read novels and carry a whimsically yellow purse to lunch with friends, who would have all also read and likedNormal People.Rooney is a self-described Marxist, and I suspect that she would enjoyVanity Fair’s neat illustration of a point she makes inNormal Peopleabout the way books can function as cultural currency. “It was culture as class performance,” thinks a character at a reading, “literature fetishized for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterward feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about.”"
How the Media Got the Hospital Explosion Wrong,2023-10-23,TheAtlantic,['Yascha Mounk'],"Last Tuesday, some of the world’s most prominent news organizations spread word about a terrible tragedy unfolding in the Gaza Strip. Images of a blast at a hospital were beginning to circulate on social media. The Palestinian health authorities claimed that Israel was responsible for the death of some 500 civilians. Because the details were extremely murky, it was impossible to tell who had caused the explosion or how many people had died. And yet some of the most reputable names in news media sentpush alertsthat broadcast Hamas’s claims far and wide.“Hundreds feared dead or injured in Israeli air strike on hospital in Gaza, Palestinian officials say,”wrotethe BBC. “At least 500 people were killed by an Israeli airstrike at a Gaza hospital, the Palestinian Health Ministry said,”wroteThe New York Times.Along with others, these news outlets ascribed these details to Palestinian authorities, thereby doing the minimum to ensure that their readers would understand where the claims originated. But both push alerts would have led reasonable readers to conclude that these statements must basically be true. Both talked about “Israeli” air strikes. Both uncritically reported that many hundreds had died. Neither explained in their push alerts that the health  authorities—and all other authorities—in Gaza are controlled by Hamas, the Islamist organization thathad brutally killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a recent surprise attack on Israel."
David Cameron’s Desperate Return to British Politics,2023-11-14,TheAtlantic,['Helen Lewis'],"In the end, Suella Braverman was brought down by some tents. Or, rather, the absence of them. On November 4, Britain’s home secretary endorsed the idea of banning homelessness charities from giving out tents to people sleeping on sidewalks. Britain was blighted,she saidon X, by aggressive panhandlers and vagrants, “many of them from abroad, living on the streets as a lifestyle choice.” Without harsh measures, “​​British cities will go the way of places in the US like San Francisco and Los Angeles.” She followed up the comments a few days later by suggesting that all of the estimated 300,000 people protesting in London for a cease-fire in Gaza were“hate marchers.”Yesterday, shewas firedfrom her post by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, in a cabinet reshuffle indicating his Conservative Party’s attempt to calibrate exactly how much culture-warring British voters can tolerate. Herresignation letteraccused Sunak of pandering to “polite opinion” and having “no appetite for doing what is necessary.” Braverman was one of the standard-bearers of the Tory right: tough on immigration, tough on welfare, and a true-blue Brexiteer. But her comments on homelessness were widely seen as cruel, as well as incomprehensible to many of the party’s target voters. Even if the online right holds up San Francisco and Los Angeles as totems of progressive failure, to most Britons those cities are “the one with the trams” and “the one where all the famous people live.” Pollingshowedthat Braverman’s rhetoric was unpopular with the electorate, and so was she."
Ilhan Omar’s Opportunity,2019-08-26,TheAtlantic,['Caitlin Flanagan'],"In July, at the Washington, D.C., conference of the Muslim Collective for Equitable Democracy, Representative Ilhan Omar gave a heated answer to a question posed by a member of the audience. The woman had asked if Omar and Representative Rashida Tlaib would be willing to make public statements condemning female genital mutilation. She said that given a recent court decision in Detroit that had found the only federal law against FGM unconstitutional, it could be “really powerful” if the two Muslim congresswomen would do so.Omar listened quietly, a half-smile playing at her lips, and then she gave her answer. She called the question “appalling”; she said that it was “frustrating”; that she was “quite disgusted, really,” that “as Muslim legislators we are constantly being asked to waste our time speaking to issues that other people are not asked to speak to.” She suggested that FGM has become a particular litmus test for Muslim elected officials, one that puts assumptions about their religious and cultural identities ahead of full confidence in their American one. Should she keep a daily schedule, she asked rhetorically, in which she reminded herself that every single day she needed to condemn FGM, al-Qaeda, and Hamas? The audience began to applaud."
Calls for a Cease-Fire—But Then What?,2023-10-21,TheAtlantic,['Elaine Godfrey'],"The protest began with a prayer. Several thousand Muslims knelt in rows before the Capitol building yesterday afternoon, their knees resting on the woven rugs they’d brought from home. Women here and men over there, with onlookers to the side. Seen from the Speaker’s Balcony, this ranked congregation would have looked like colorful stripes spanning the grassy width of the National Mall.“We are witnessing, before our eyes, the slaughter of thousands of people on our streets,” Omar Suleiman, the imam who led the prayer, had said beforehand. “We are witnesses to the cruelty that has been inflicted upon our brothers and sisters in Palestine on a regular basis.”The prayer group was part of a demonstration hosted by more than a dozen self-described progressive and religious organizations to call for an Israel-Hamas cease-fire. After Hamas massacred more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in its October 7 attack, Israeli bombardments of Gazahave reportedly killedmore than 4,000 Palestinians, the great majority of whom were also civilians."
The Myth of the 'Female' Foreign Policy,2016-08-25,TheAtlantic,['Kathy Gilsinan'],"Margot Wallström took office as Sweden’s foreign minister in 2014, declaring she would pursue a “feminist foreign policy.” She’s now held the post for two years, and it’s still not entirely clear what she meant. While it’s true that an entire school of feminist international-relations theoryhas developedsince the 1980s, the field remains contested, andlargely untestedin the realm of policy. You could surmise from Wallström’s term, as she herselfstated, that a “feminist foreign policy” would promote women’s rights around the world, but what would it say, for example, about the logic of preventive war? Would it prioritize free trade and open borders, or emphasize protecting workers from competition? Would it generate a new way of dealing with unsecured nuclear material in the former Soviet Union?Granted, Wallström has not had much time to implement the idea; relative to longstanding foreign-policy traditions like realism, feminist foreign policy hasn’t yet had a chance to leave much of a track record. So far, one of its key features has been controversy: The Swedish foreign minister’s first major move was to recognize Palestine, infuriating Israel; Saudi Arabia temporarilybroke ties with her governmentover her vocal stance on human rights (she had declared the kingdom’s flogging of a blogger to be “medieval.”) She has spoken upfor migrants and against rapeas a weapon of war. And her ongoing experiment raises bigger questions about what it means for more women to conduct foreign policy, not just as ministers and diplomats, but as heads of state. In short, whether the foreign policy is explicitly feminist or not: Do countries behave differently when women are in charge?"
A Paralyzed House Complicates Biden’s Plans for Israel,2023-10-21,TheAtlantic,['The Editors'],"After returning from a trip to Tel Aviv to demonstrate U.S. support for Israel’s war with Hamas, President Joe Biden used Thursday evening’s Oval Office address to make the case for sending wartime aid to Israel and continuing American support for Ukraine.The president’s plan is complicated by events at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.

Netanyahu Flinched,2023-03-27,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"Last night, hundreds of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets, believing their country’s democracy to be in peril. The immediate precipitant for this popular protest was the firing of Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister. A former general tasked with overseeing the Jewish state’s security, Gallant had called for his own coalition to pause its attempted overhaul of the Israeli judicial system, arguing that division around the plan was undermining national cohesion. Rather than accede to Gallant’s proposal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired him. But although this removal provided the spark for Israel’s extraordinary explosion of civil dissent, the tinder had been building for months.In January, shortly after the newhard-right Israeli governmentassumed office, itunveiledits first major initiative: a sweeping reconstruction of the country’s judiciary. Israel’s Supreme Court is arguably the most powerful such body in the world, and experts and politicians have long called for a recalibration of its powers. But the radical wish list produced by Netanyahu’s coalition seeks not to reform the court but to neuter it, and would essentiallyallowthe ruling government to appoint all judges and override their decisions. This plan was composed in the halls ofconservative think tanks, with no input from opposition parties and no attempt to broker a national consensus. What’s more, this effort to fundamentally revise Israel’s democratic order came from a government that received less than half the vote in the last election."
Trump Shrugs Off the Two-State Solution,2017-02-15,TheAtlantic,['Adam Chandler'],"By most accounts, July will mark the 80thanniversary of the two-state solution. It was in 1937 that the British Peel Commission set about to understand why Arab riots had engulfed Mandatory Palestine. “An irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national communities within the narrow bounds of one small country,”the commission concluded. “There is no common ground between them. Their national aspirations are incompatible.” The commission determined that the land should be divided into two countries—one Jewish and one Arab.Since then, the germ of the Peel Commission has served as the most-agreed-upon guidepost for resolving what is now a century-long conflict. On Wednesday, however, President Donald Trumpbroke with decades of U.S. diplomacyby announcing that he wasn’t committed to solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the two-state solution. “I’m looking at two states and one state, I like the one that both parties like,” the president said at a joint White House press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “I can live with either one.” Trump was echoed more vaguely by Netanyahu, who offered that hewould rather dealwith “substance,” rather than “labels.” The only problem, which the Peel Commission identified all those years ago, is that the conflict itself is defined by labels."
Trump's Visit to Bethlehem ,2017-05-23,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"The third day of President Trump’s first overseas visit took him to the West Bank city of Bethlehem, where he pledged “to do everything” to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians.“Peace is a choice we must make each day, and the United States is here to help make that dream possible for young Jewish, Christians and Muslim children all across the region,” Trump said Tuesday duringa press conferenceat Abbas’s presidential palace, adding that “in this spirit of hope, we came to Bethlehem, asking God for more peaceful, safe, and far more tolerant world for all of us.”Trump praised Abbas for attending hissummitSunday with leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries in Riyadh and for committing “to taking firm but necessary steps to fight terrorism and confront its hateful ideology.” Both leaders offered their condolences to the victims of Monday’sterrorist attackin Manchester—for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility— that killed at least 22 people and injured several dozen others.“Peace can never take root in an environment where violence is tolerated, funded and even rewarded,” Trump said in apparent reference to the Palestinian Authority’s payments to the families of Palestinian prisoners and those killed in the conflict with Israel, which Israel has long condemned.Abbas reaffirmed his commitment to work with the U.S. and the Israelis so that “the children of Palestine and Israel can enjoy a safe, stable, and prosperous future,” adding that “Palestinian people’s attainment of their freedom and independence is the key.”In addition to protesting Israel’s continued occupation and settlement expansion within the West Bank, Abbas also raised the issue of the Palestinian prisoner hunger strike, in which approximately 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, including popular Palestinian figure and Abbas rivalMarwan Barghouti, have called for improved conditions in Israeli prisons."
Iran Needs to Believe America’s Threat,2023-03-05,TheAtlantic,['Dennis Ross'],"While the international community was focused on the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inspectors from the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),discovereduranium residue enriched to 84 percent in Iranian centrifuge cascades. Weapons-grade fissile material is typically characterized as uranium enriched to 90 percent, but it is worth recalling that the U.S. atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945 was a fission weapon enriched to an average of 80 percent. The Iranians mayclaimthat they are not enriching beyond 60 percent, and that these are mere particles, but the discovery should set off alarm bells.It is a reminder that Iran has achieved the capacity to produce weapons-grade material very quickly. Enriching to 60 percent—something that the IAEA’s director, Rafael Grossi, says has “no justification forcivilian purposes”—has already put the Iranians in that position. Granted, creating weapons-grade fissile material is not the same as having a bomb, but it is the most important element needed for bomb-making. The IAEA may not know yet whether the 84 percent is simply a limited residue from the cascades or whether this was a deliberate move by the Iranians to enrich to near weapons-grade. But we do know that, for the second time in a month, Iran has engaged in suspicious activity at an enrichment site. AtFordow, the Iranians connected two clusters of advanced centrifuges enriching uranium to 60 percent and did not inform the IAEA that it had done so. This is contrary to their obligations under the terms of the nuclear-nonproliferation treaty. Now there is also the 84 percent finding."
Ilhan Omar Just Made It Harder to Have a Nuanced Debate About Israel,2019-02-11,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"In the anti-Semitic imagination, Jews run the world through a global conspiracy of cash and power. This belief is both old and resilient, and in the past seven decades, anti-Semites have relied on this framework to explain the tight alliance between the United States and Israel.On Sunday night, a freshman representative from Minnesota, Ilhan Omar, cheerfully repeated this anti-Semitic trope, implying that AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, pays politicians to support Israel. Top Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have called on Omar to “reject anti-Semitism in all forms,”according toThe Washington Post, while Republicans have argued that her comments reveal the depth of anti-Israel sentiment in the Democratic Party. “I unequivocally apologize,” Omar said in a tweeted statement on Monday. “At the same time, I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA, or the fossil-fuel industry. It’s gone on too long and we must be willing to address it.”Along with perpetuating anti-Semitic stereotypes, Omar’s comments were inaccurate and incomplete: AIPAC’s influence, which does not include payments to politicians, is only a small part of why the U.S.-Israel alliance is almost universally supported in Congress. Her comments, and the backlash they provoked, show how fractured the American debate over Israel has become. Omar is the new face of anti-Israel criticism on the left, and yet her use of anti-Semitic tropes undermines her credibility. Her comments have provoked a cycle of outrage, amplifying the most extreme voices on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and limiting the chances for more nuanced debate over America’s support for Israeli policies. Instead of creating more space for critical debate about Israel, Omar has added credence to a common caricature of the anti-Israel left: that opposition to Israel is partly fueled by conspiratorial anti-Semitism."
Something Dark Unfolded in Jerusalem This Week,2022-06-03,TheAtlantic,[],
The Israeli Minister Who Is Defending Elon Musk,2023-05-24,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"Updated at 4:55 p.m. ET on May 24, 2023.When Elon Musk tweeted that the Jewish financier George Soros “hates humanity” and “wants to erode the very fabric of civilization,” he drew international condemnation. Musk’s outburst was “not just distressing,” but “dangerous,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the Anti-Defamation League’s CEO,saidon Twitter. “It will embolden extremists who already contrive anti-Jewish conspiracies and have tried to attack Soros and Jewish communities as a result.” Later that day, Israel’s foreign ministrytweeted, “The phrase ‘The Jews’ spiked today on the list of topics trending on Twitter following a tweet with antisemitic overtones by none other than the owner and CEO of the social network, Elon Musk.”But soon after, that statement was deleted and disavowed by Israel’s foreign minister, whopromised, “There will be no tweets like this again.” The next day, Amichai Chikli, the country’s minister of diaspora affairs, went further. A hard-right politician who first entered Israel’s parliament in 2021, Chikli broke with his own party when it joined the country’s recent anti–Benjamin Netanyahu government, and was later rewarded with a parliamentary seat in Netanyahu’s Likud party. Last Thursday on Twitter, he publiclypraisedMusk as an entrepreneur and “role model,” and declared that “criticism of Soros - who finances the most hostile organizations to the Jewish people and the state of Israel is anything but anti-Semitism, quite the opposite!” Chikli subsequently doubled down on this position, citing an op-ed written by Alan Dershowitz thatstates, “No sin­gle per­son has done more to dam­age Is­rael’s stand­ing in the world, es­pe­cially among so-called pro­gres­sives, than George Soros.”"
Boycott Bans Are an Assault on Free Speech,2023-03-09,TheAtlantic,['Adam Serwer'],"America began with boycotts. Angry about Britain’s tax raises, the historianT. H. Breen writes, American colonists saw their refusal to purchase British goods as a “reflexive response to taxation without representation,” and their collective action helped forge an early sense of American identity as a precursor to the Revolution itself.The Revolution-era boycotts werehardly the last American consumer protests. Abolitionists urged Americans to buy only goods produced by “free labor,” and the 20th-century civil-rights movement famously included the Montgomery bus boycott against Alabama’s segregated public-transportation system. Boycotts, as my colleague Conor Friedersdorfwrote in 2018, are “a bedrock of American civic life, inseparable from the Constitution’s guarantee of free speech and the wariness many feel whenever a law compels humans to violate their conscience.”Boycotting as a tactic does not have a particular ideological valence. Conservatives called for a boycott of Dunkin’ Donuts over apaisley scarf they mistook for a kaffiyehand of the shaving company Gillette for anadvertisement criticizing “toxic masculinity.”In 2017, they tossedtheir Keurig machines out the windowover that company’s decision to stop advertising on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show after he defended the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost a close election in Alabama following revelations thathe had hit on teenagerswhile in his 30s (conservative punditsdon’t count that as “grooming,”because he is heterosexual). These probably won’t be remembered as fondly as resisting the British or undermining slavery, but the point is that there’s a boycott for people of any ideological persuasion."
Palestine Isn’t Ferguson,2021-10-24,TheAtlantic,['Susie Linfield'],"In the imaginationof the Christian West, Jews have been forced to fill every role. For 2,000 years, they have been seen as the ultimate shape-shifters: craven, feeble, abject, weak, and humiliated, but also powerful, conspiratorial, and demonic. They are the prime, indeed fatal, danger to the societies in which they live: arch-capitalists and arch-revolutionaries. Jews are a symbol, a metaphor, an essence. So it should come as no surprise that the state of the Jewish people, where almost half of the world’s Jews live, is also viewed in this way. Israel is both an obsession and an abstraction—as the Jewish people have been for much of Western history.Israel is unusual in that it existed as an idea before it existed as a nation-state. Today, it is also unusual, even remarkable, for lacking internationally recognized borders—an indispensable marker of sovereignty—and for decades it has been depriving Palestinians in the occupied territories of political rights and freedom. “After 1967, Israel stopped becoming a normal nation-state,” Arnon Degani, a Hebrew University history professor who is a member of the anti-occupation veterans’ group Breaking the Silence, told me recently. “Time passed on, and Israel becomes more and more abnormal.” Leftist Israelis—many of whom define themselvesasZionists—call the occupation criminal, atrocious, unbearable; their critique is broader, and deeper, than most of what you read or hear in the United States. As a result of the occupation, the literary critic Nissim Calderon told me, “Wider and wider circles of life, both for Israelis and Palestinians, become infected with cruelty.”"
Arab Women Are Tired of Talking About Just ‘Women’s Issues’,2019-08-24,TheAtlantic,['Kim Ghattas'],"The striking image of a tall woman dressed in white, lightly veiled, wearing large gold earrings, and raising a finger asshe ledseveral hundred men and women in chants of protest against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir went viral in April.Described as a Nubian queen, 22-year old Alaa Salah quickly became an icon of the movement to bring down Bashir—and of the widespread participation of women in the protests that eventually resulted in his ouster. Her efforts, and those of many other women, were covered extensively by the media as an extraordinary moment, almost an exception.Yet before Sudan, women were at the forefront of protests in Benghazi, Libya, in 2011; and in Yemen that same year, with one, Tawakkol Karman, going on to win a Nobel Peace Prize. And women were key to the activism that helped sustain the protests and civilian resistance against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with hundreds if not thousands of them landing in government jails."
The Implosion of Jeremy Corbyn,2019-04-12,TheAtlantic,['Nicky Woolf'],"It may have been at the Sternberg Center, where a large overflow marquee housed my London congregation on the High Holidays. There was an abandoned trailer in the woods behind it, and we kids would sneak out to play in it. I don’t even remember specifically when it happened. But I remember the sound of the word the first time I heard it spoken, its icy vituperation, the way the speaker’s jaw moved around the syllable. “Kike.”Even so, until recently, “anti-Semitism” still struck me as a clinical concept, remote from my daily experiences. But Jeremy Corbyn has made it unavoidable. The leader of the Labour Party has managed to create a self-made political calamity of hypnotic proportions, one that could destroy his opposition party even as Brexit immolates the Conservative government.From the beginning, Corbyn has flailed, unable to navigate the gray area of the anti-Semitism within the ranks of his own party. As a campaigner and backbencher, he long had the luxury of defining his career by what he rebelled against. Anti-war. Anti-nuke. Anti-Zionist. Now, though, people ask him more difficult questions. He still wants the benefit of the doubt, and gets testy when he doesn’t get it."
Israel’s Democracy Movement Has Something Important to Teach Us,2023-08-14,TheAtlantic,['Susie Linfield'],"The left in the U.S. hasn’t shown much love for the democracy movement that has rocked Israel since January. Such indifference is, perhaps, unsurprising, because many progressives consider Israel to be a—if not the—force for evil in the world. At its recent convention, the Democratic Socialists of America put forward a resolution titled “Make DSA an Anti-Zionist Organization in Principle and Praxis,” and theHarvard Crimsoneditorial board has “proudly” endorsed a campus protest that equated Zionism with “white supremacy,” among other ills. Even many liberals, including Jewish ones, seem oddly disconnected from the events that are unfolding; in the United States, demonstrations against the Netanyahu government have been insignificant and mainly confined to small left-Zionist groups.Some criticsinsistthat Israel isn’t a real democracy because Arab Israelis face discrimination, or because Israel was founded as a state of refuge for the Jewish people, or because the occupation persists. Underlying this view is an oddly moralistic, rather than political, understanding of democracy that confuses it with purity. Democracy—the rule of law, the equality of citizenship, the balance of governmental powers, the freedom to speak and publish, the protection of minorities, the sanctity of elections, the ability to be religious or secular—can be, and in fact usually is, partial and incomplete. Democracies have been known, and not just occasionally, to embark on odious wars, support oppressive institutions, and sustain colonialism; see, for instance, France when it ruled Algeria. The difference is that Israel’s colony—the West Bank—abuts it, rather than being a thousand miles away."
Saudi Arabia Does a Big Favor for Iran,2018-10-15,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"When the Trump administration talks about “severe punishment” for a country in the Middle East, it is generally referring to Iran, a country whose regional influence troubles both its Arab neighbors as well as the United States. Yet on Sunday, President Donald Trump used those words to describe what could happen to Saudi Arabia— arguably the closest U.S. ally in the Muslim world— if investigations determine that the regime is complicit in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident journalist.“Well, there’s a lot at stake. There’s a lot at stake. And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter,”Trump told CBS’s60 Minutesin an interview broadcast Sunday. “There’s something … really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case. So we’re going to have to see. We’re going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.” (Trump reiterated that Washington won’t suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the case, because, in his view, it would adversely affect the U.S. economy.) And, as if to ensure that the discussion of the case won’t end anytime soon, the state-run Saudi Press Agencyquoteda source earlier Sunday as saying the kingdom rejects “threats or attempts to undermine it,” adding that the kingdom will “respond to any action with a bigger one.” (A subsequent tweet Sunday from the Saudi Embassyin Washington later walked back that language.)On Monday, Trumptweetedthat he had spoken to King Salman, “who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened” to Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and U.S. resident. “He said that they are working closely with Turkey to find answer. I am immediately sending our Secretary of State to meet with King!”The Khashoggi affair represents a dramatic change in fortunes for Saudi Arabia, which until just two weeks ago was being lauded for its social and economic reforms. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MbS, was widely being acclaimed as the face of the modern kingdom. He gave interviews in which he outlined his plans, took the opportunity to say Iran’s supreme leader “makes Hitler look good,” and accused Iran of being behind “any problem in the Middle East.” There was a darker side to the announced Saudi reforms, however—arbitrary arrests, a costly war in Yemen, a clampdown on dissent. But that drew little rebuke from the West as long as Iran maintained its support for terrorist groups; its influence in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen; its ballistic-missile program; and its continued threats against Israel."
The Progressives Who Flunked the Hamas Test,2023-10-13,TheAtlantic,['Helen Lewis'],"Updated at 8:15 ET a.m. on October 13, 2023The terror attackon Israel by Hamas has been a divisive—if clarifying—moment for the left. The test that it presented was simple: Can you condemn the slaughter of civilians, in massacres that now appear to have been calculatedly sadistic and outrageous, without equivocation or whataboutism? Can you lay down, for a moment, your legitimate criticisms of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, West Bank settlements, and the conditions in Gaza, and express horror at the mass murder of civilians?In corners of academia and social-justice activism where the identity of the oppressor and the oppressed are never in doubt, many people failed that test. In response to a fellow progressive who argued that targeting civilians is always wrong, the Yale professor Zareena Grewalreplied: “Settlers are not civilians. This is not hard.” (She has since locked her X account.) Chicago’s Black Lives Matter chapter posted a picture of a paraglider, referencing the gunmen who descended on civilians at a music festival near the Gaza border from the air. (The chapter said in astatementthat “we aren’t proud” of the post, which was later deleted.) Harvard student groups posted a letter stating that its signatories “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” (Several of the named groups have sincewithdrawntheir endorsement.)"
The Books Briefing: One Small Step That Opened a Lifetime of Wonder,2019-07-19,TheAtlantic,['Myles Poydras'],"This week marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, which revealed a new visual perspective of humans’ home planet, set in the deep suspension of a newly documented outer space. The fiction writer Don DeLillo incorporated that image into a short story, in which one character aboard an orbiting space station becomes transfixed by the look of Earth at a distance. The astronaut Chris Hadfield took thousands of photographs during his own, real-life orbit, which he published in a book for people who may never get to enjoy the same view.Even before space travel became a reality,the imaginative looks at the galaxy inFrancis Godwin’s and Margaret Cavendish’s 17th-century science fiction may have helped to inspire deeper exploration into the unknown. A novel by the security theorists Peter Singer and August Cole describes, in thrilling detail, how a war in space could play out. And Lorrie Moore’s short stories capture the oddity of human nature by imagining people as aliens."
MAGA Is the Mullet of Politics,2023-02-24,TheAtlantic,['David A. Graham'],"After a train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, on February 3, national attention was slow to turn to the crash. That has now changed decisively. In the past 10 days, EPA Administrator Michael Regan, former President Donald Trump, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg have all visited the town. A lively national political debate has also emerged, but it’s one that, like the burning rail cars, has produced a lot of heat, but not a great deal of light.The disaster has become a proxy battle where existing political divides are playing out—and where the failings of both of the contemporary parties are on clear display. The Democratic Party struggles to respond effectively to a crisis with empathy rather than technocratic policy lectures. The Trump-era Republican Party, meanwhile, says all the right things and advocates for all the wrong ones.The conversation on the right is especially revealing. Some factions of conservative media have accused the mainstream press and Democratic establishment of ignoring the story, though in fact Fox News wasjust as late as its competitors. Nonetheless, Trump and other MAGA-minded Republicans, like Ohio’s newly elected senator, J. D. Vance, have embraced East Palestine as an example of how the Democratic Party has abandoned white working-class areas of the industrial Midwest. Tucker Carlson has gone further,arguingthat the response has been slow because the town is conservative and largely white."

Culinary Feminism and Banksy Goes to Bethlehem: The Week in Global-Affairs Writing,2017-03-10,TheAtlantic,['Anna Diamond'],"Things Only Seem to ChangeLinda Kinstler |Mary Review“When Ukraine greeted the Euromaidan Revolution in November 2013, memories of the 2004 Orange Revolution, a protest against political corruption that ultimately had little impact on government integrity, still lingered in the public imagination. The country had grown perilously accustomed to the absence of change and deeply skeptical of those who dared to promise to bring it about. Almost three years, two governments, and a small army of foreign correspondents have come and gone since then, but the sentiment remains.”The Underground Railroad for RefugeesJake Halpern |The New Yorker“In the fall of 2014, two Afghan police officers, Mohammed Naweed Samimi and Mohammed Yasin Ataye, travelled to America on temporary visas. For five weeks, along with other law-enforcement officers from Afghanistan, they attended lectures on intelligence-gathering techniques at a Drug Enforcement Administration facility in Virginia. One Saturday, the trainees took buses into Washington, D.C., for a day of sightseeing. That evening, they all returned to the buses—except for Samimi and Ataye."
This Will Be a Pyrrhic Victory for Hamas,2023-10-07,TheAtlantic,['Natan Sachs'],"In the hours following Hamas’s large-scale surprise attack on Israel early this morning, Israelis on social media quickly dubbed the day a “second Yom Kippur”—referring to the surprise attack on Israel by Egypt and Syria in 1973—or an “Israeli 9/11.” Not since the 1947–49 Arab-Israeli War had Palestinian or Arab forces captured Israeli villages.Hamas executed a stunning military surprise, breaching the Israeli border in multiple ways and attacking more than 20 Israeli population centers, as well as military bases. Militants kidnapped dozens of Israelis—apparently including children and the elderly—and captured military personnel. Israeli social media and news outlets filled with calls for help from families in southern Israeli towns occupied by Hamas, sheltering in their homes as armed terrorists went door-to-door. The failure of Israel’s intelligence and preparedness is second only to that in 1973.But this Hamas victory might prove Pyrrhic. In fact, Hamas itself might have been surprised by the extent of its initial success. The trauma in Israel today should give pause to those thinking that Israel will simply acquiesce to a short tit for tat. As bad as things have been in Gaza in the past two decades—and they have been terrible—the coming weeks could prove even worse.Israel will now likely go to great lengths to hunt down those involved. The Israel Defense Forces have already begun bombarding the Gaza Strip. Once they finish clearing Israeli towns of Hamas militants, they will turn their focus in earnest toward Gaza."

There’s a Word for Blaming Jews for Anti-Semitism,2023-09-06,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"For most people, Labor Day weekend was a time for rest and relaxation with friends and family. But for Elon Musk and countless users on Twitter, it was an opportunity to denounce a Jewish organization as the source of their sorrows.Over the past several days, hundreds of thousands of posts on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, have assailed the Anti-Defamation League, the premier Jewish civil-rights organization, under the hashtag #BanTheADL. Ostensibly, the campaign is a response to the ADL’s persistent public pressure on Twitter to remove bigotry from its platform, on the grounds that the organization’s activism is censorious and causing advertisers to abandon the site. But in practice, as even a cursory glance at #BanTheADL’smanybigotedboostersreveals, the viral vilification is not about anything the ADL has done; it’s about whom the grouprepresents.Like any organization, the ADL is not above reproach. I’vewritten criticallyabout some of its well-meaning but misguided social-media-moderationefforts, and am to the group’s left on questions of anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. On the right, politically conservative Jews have long taken issue with the ADL’s more progressive stances. But none of this is what is driving the current consternation on Twitter."
‘America First’ Enters Its Most Combustible Moment,2020-08-29,TheAtlantic,['William J. Burns'],"The months before and after a presidential election are particularly fragile for foreign policy. Each of the five presidents I served understood, as did his team, the weight of this time. Politics and legacy were always front of mind. They were all also conscious of the ways they could help pave an easier path for their successors. They all ultimately put country over party. That won’t be the case with Donald Trump. If the next 150 days turn out to be Trump’s final days in office, he could still wreak a lot of havoc on American foreign policy.As a young National Security Council staffer, I sat in the Oval Office in December 1988 as Ronald Reagan—the fireplace crackling behind him—authorized the first-ever U.S. dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization. He saw it, at least in part, as a way to spare his successor, then–Vice President George H. W. Bush, from spending precious political capital early in his administration on an essential, if controversial, step toward Middle East peacemaking.At the end of the George H. W. Bush administration, in January 1993, as the head of the State Department’s policy-planning staff, I wrote a long transitionmemorandumfor incoming Secretary of State Warren Christopher. That memo was not appreciably different from a draft I had written six months earlier, prematurely titled “A Foreign Policy for the Second Bush Term.” The point of the exercise was less the title, or even the content, than the commitment to a responsible transition and the national interest."
‘The Whole Country Has PTSD’,2023-10-27,TheAtlantic,['Gal Beckerman'],"Thewarbetween Israel and Hamas has progressed at such speed, with body counts mounting by the hour, that it can feel like the chasm of human grief it is leaving behind has gotten relatively little attention. In Israel, the society I know better, every individual seems to be connected to someone who was murdered or has been kidnapped. In Gaza, death surely feels inescapable. I have been worried about this reverberation of pain almost from the moment I learned what Hamas had done—that a grief this overwhelming will harden people such that generations will have to pass before any political resolution feels remotely possible.“The whole country has PTSD,” was the first thing the Israeli writer Etgar Keret texted me a week after the attack. I realized that he was the person I most wanted to speak with. Keret has long beenan impish figureon the Israeli literary scene, writing very short, absurdist stories for three decades, contemporary fairy tales that are allegorical and often gut-punching. What Keret hasn’t tried to do is be thevoice of Israel. Unlike a generation of writers before him who were comfortable with this role—famously, Amos Oz, David Grossman, and A. B. Yehoshua—Keret is more concerned with how humans survive being human. Possibly, this is why his stories have had such universal appeal, regularly featured onThis American Life."
The Shadow of Jihadi John,2016-01-20,TheAtlantic,['Simon Cottee'],"On Tuesday, inissue 13of its online magazineDabiq, ISIS confirmed the death of Mohammed Emwazi (a.k.a “Jihad John”), the group’s notorious British-accented, ninja-suited, knife-wielding executioner in HD—andposter boyof the jihadist jet set. This isn’t exactly news: Emwazi’s death was widely reported last November, after the Pentagonannouncedthat it had targeted him in an air strike in Raqqa, Syria on November 12. “It’s still a little early, but we are reasonably certain we killed the target that we intended to kill, which is Jihadi John,”saidColonel Steve Warren.In a section of the magazine titled, “The Best Shuhadā [martys]” Emwazi, who is referred to as Abū Muhārib al-Muhājir, is eulogized as an “honorable brother.” His exploits on the battlefield, his resourcefulness in escaping the attentions of the “much-overrated MI5 British intelligence agency” and making it toShām(Syria), his generosity (apparently, after receiving asabiyyah, or sex slave, as a gift, “he did not hesitate to give her away—likewise as a gift—to an unmarried injured brother”), his fierce piety (it’s reported that on one occasion, back in “the lands of Kufr,” he nearly decked a “pro-Saudi Salafi” scholar who had spoken ill of the sisters in Palestine), and his “harshness towards the kuffar [non-believers]” are all fulsomely praised."
The Costly Success of Israel’s Iron Dome,2021-05-24,TheAtlantic,['Anshel Pfeffer'],"In the 12 days that preceded Thursday’s announcement of a cease-fire, the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched4,369rocketsof various sizes and ranges from Gaza toward Israel. According to Israel’s military, nearly two-thirds of these missed their target, hitting fields and other open areas, or malfunctioning and falling short. That still leaves about 1,500 rockets that headed for built-up areas. Remarkably, this barrage resulted in only a dozen deaths: More than 90 percent of the rockets were intercepted by Israel’s missile-defense system, Iron Dome.If you’ve been watching coverage of the latest round of fighting in Gaza and Israel, you won’t have escaped the Iron Dome pyrotechnic display, astonishing especially at night as the rockets arching northward from Gaza are picked out of the sky in a litany of mid-air explosions. When it was first established more than a decade ago, Iron Dome had its skeptics, both in Israel and abroad, but over time, they—and the world—have seen it work. Literally."
Russia Is Not the First to Blame Jews for Their Own Holocaust,2022-05-05,TheAtlantic,[],
Why a Gaza Cease-Fire Is Unrealistic,2023-11-08,TheAtlantic,['Daniel Kurtzer'],"Humanitarian pause or cease-fire: These two proposals for arresting the fighting in the Israel-Hamas war have gained traction in recent days. President Joe Biden continues to support Israel’s campaign against Hamas butfavors a pause, so as to make time for more Palestinians to move out of harm’s way and for more food, water, fuel, and medical supplies to enter into Gaza. Others, both in the United States and abroad, argue for a cease-fire, saying that enough is enough with Israel’s bombing campaign and ground operations.The approaches sound similar in name but are in fact very different. Both convey the cessation of hostilities. But a humanitarian pause is temporary, with the specific purpose of improving the humanitarian situation—in this case, to allow aid into Gaza; provide time for Palestinians to move south, away from Gaza City; and enable foreign citizens and those in need of special medical care to exit Gaza via the Rafah crossing into Egypt. A cease-fire can also be temporary but is usually meant to last for a more extended time, to encourage the start of peace talks or other arrangements that deal with an underlying conflict. Much more than a pause, a cease-fire cements the situation on the ground until it is violated.Israel and Hamas have asymmetric goals in this war. Israel has said that it intends to destroy Hamas, but that objective is beyond reach. Hamas is an extreme religious resistance movement, not a defined army or an organization with identifiable members. But Israel’s stated goal signals its intention to decapitate Hamas’s leadership, demolish as much of its infrastructure as possible, blow up its arms depots and tunnels, and degrade its military capacities. To this end, Israel is planning for an extended military campaign that will prevent Hamas from reconstituting itself to engage in future terrorism against Israel."

Don’t Equate Anti-Zionism With Anti-Semitism,2023-11-03,TheAtlantic,['Adam Serwer'],"On October 7, the Islamist militant group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, killed morethan 1,400 people in Israel. Israel responded with military operations that havekilled several times that numberof Palestinians in Gaza, a territorydescribed by Human Rights Watchas an “open-air prison” as a result of an Israeli and Egyptian blockade. In both cases, most of the casualties are civilians. The conflict has reverberated into other areas of the world, including the United States, where anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim incidents haveincludedthe killing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy. The bloodshed has revived the perennial debates about anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.“Look, it’s clear that the hardened anti-Zionists from the far left are the photo inverse of the white supremacists from the far right,” Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatttold CNN’s Dana Bashearlier this week. “There is no argument anymore that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism, that is as plain as day. And to think that extremism only comes from one side of the spectrum is a joke.” Greenblatt’s sentiments wereechoedamong supporters of Israel, including in publications such asThe Wall Street JournalandThe Jerusalem Post, which editorialized that “to deny the Jewish people, and only the Jewish people, a right afforded to all nations—is to discriminate against Jews.”"
A Decade Under Erdogan’s Shadow,2023-05-26,TheAtlantic,['Suzy Hansen'],"The Magnum photographer Emin Özmen remembers the day in 1993 when radical Islamists set fire to the Madımak Hotel in his hometown of Sivas, Turkey, killing 37 people. Intellectuals and artists had gathered there for a festival honoring a 16th-century Alevi poet.Many of those who died were themselves Alevis, members of a Muslim sect that is a minority in Turkey. During the 1970s, right-wing Sunni groups often fought Alevi leftist groups in the streets. The violence eventually subsided, but tensions remained—the horror at Madımak, when Özmen was 8 years old, was the result. It made Özmen want to become a witness.On Sunday, May 14, Turkey’s first Alevi candidate for president, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, faced off against Turkey’s longtime autocrat, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, a Sunni Muslim who rose to power in 2003, five years before Özmen became a working photojournalist. Over the course of Özmen’s career, he has watched and documented as Erdoğan has transformed Turkey from an aspiring democracy into a polarized autocracy with a failing economy.Those Turks who have suffered from repression, violence, and hunger these past 20 years believed Kılıçdaroğlu might have a chance at winning this week, despite the vociferous opposition to him from Turkey’s right-wing populace, which disdains him because he is an Alevi liberal and because he is not Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. But neither candidate gained the required 50 percent of the vote. The election will go to a runoff on May 28, and Erdoğan still has a chance—many Turks see it as a foregone conclusion—to prevail as president for another five years."
Muslim Americans Are United by Trump—and Divided by Race,2017-03-11,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"When weary Muslims gathered in Toronto in December for an annual retreat, marking the end of a tumultuous U.S. election year, they probably didn’t expect the event to turn into a referendum on racial tensions within the American Muslim community. But it did.One session was led by Hamza Yusuf, a well respected white scholar who co-founded Zaytuna College, which claims to be America’s first Muslim liberal-arts college. At the end, he was asked whether Muslims should work with groups like Black Lives Matter. “The United States is probably, in terms of its laws, one of the least racist societies in the world,” he replied. “We have between 15,000 and 18,000 homicides per year. Fifty percent are black-on-black crime, literally. … There are twice as many whites that have been shot by police, but nobody ever shows those videos.”He went on. “It’s the assumption that the police are racist. It’s not always the case,” he said. “Any police now that shoots a black is immediately considered a racist.”The backlash on social media was swift and immense. “For black Muslims, hearing this from somebody we’ve all come to love and trust—it was a cold slap in the face,” said Ubaydullah Evans, the executive director of the American Learning Institute for Muslims, who is black. He said he saw Yusuf’s comments as a way of perpetuating myths about “black pathology” and blaming African Americans for violence. Yusuf’s statements were indeed somewhat misleading: While a greater number of white people have been shot by the police compared to black people, that statistic doesn’t account for population size. When that adjustment is made,historical data showsthat black people are more likely to be shot by police than white people.Even though slightly less than one-third of American Muslims are black,accordingto Pew Research Center, American Muslims are most often represented in the media as Arab or South Asian immigrants. The distinction between the African-American Muslim experience and that of their immigrant co-religionists has long been a source of racial tension in the Muslim community, but since the election, things have gotten both better and worse. While some Muslims seem to be paying more attention to racism because of Donald Trump, others fear that any sign of internal division is dangerous for Muslims in a time of increased hostility.While the Toronto conference was upsetting, Evans said, he doesn’t think it’s representative of the biggest racial problems in the American Muslim community. White racism toward black people is “not the kind of racism that circumscribes my life as an American Muslim,” he told me. “It’s the social racism I experience from people of Arab descent, of Southeast Asian descent. This is the racism no one is talking about.”"
The Israeli-Saudi Deal Had Better Be a Good One,2023-08-10,TheAtlantic,['Andrew Exum'],"Over the past several weeks, Israeli and American officials have teased a possibledealto normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such an agreement has the potential to be a diplomatic triumph: Successive U.S. administrations, going back decades and from both parties, have considered the security of both Israel and the Arabian Peninsula to be vital interests that Americans would fight and die for if necessary. A deal that advances both objectives by normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia would be—shouldbe—greeted with much fanfare and near-universal approval in Washington.Precisely because they will come under pressure to celebrate any deal that’s announced, however, U.S. policy makers need to be clear about what is and is not a “win.” Congress in particular should be prepared to ask hard questions about any deal. A deal that commits the United States to an undiminished or even a growing presence in the region, whether in the form of troop numbers or policy attention, is a bad deal. So is one that rests on any Saudi motive other than a genuine desire to normalize relations with Israel."
Top 25 News Photos of 2023,2023-12-04,TheAtlantic,['Alan Taylor'],"Updated at 10:30 AM ET on December 7, 2023As the end of the year approaches, here is a look back at some of the major news events and moments of 2023. Hamas militants launched a surprise attack in southern Israel, followed by thousands of Israeli air strikes in Gaza; a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon was shot down over the U.S.; extreme weather events affected people around the world; a devastating earthquake struck parts of Turkey and Syria; and much more. Here, we present the top 25 news photos of 2023.A Palestinian man mourns as civil-defense teams and residents search for people trapped under the debris of a demolished building following Israeli air strikes that hit the Al-Shati refugee camp, in Gaza City, Gaza, on October 24, 2023. In early October, Israel declared war on Hamas following the surprise attacks by Hamas militants on October 7 that left 1,200 people dead in Israel and more than 200 taken hostage.

The Man Working to Keep the Water On in Gaza,2023-11-02,TheAtlantic,['Hanna Rosin'],"Numbers are one way to make the destruction of war legible: number of hostages, number of children killed, number of buildings destroyed, number of aid trucks that made it across the Egyptian border. For Marwan Bardawil, who lives in Gaza, the unit of peril he tracks is cubic meters per hour. Bardawil is a water engineer with the Palestinian Water Authority overseeing Gaza. And these days he is measuring, in cubic meters per hour, the quantity of water flowing through the pipes that, in prewar time, carried 10 percent of Gazans’ drinking water—pipes that are controlled by Israel. Right now, with other water sources dwindling, those pipes are Gaza’s lifeline. “The people are really in need of each drop of water,” he told me.For the past week, I’ve been checking in with Bardawil every day as he struggles to find clean sources of water. (You can hear our phone conversations onthis week’s episodeofRadio Atlantic). In the best of times, Bardawil’s job is difficult. Gaza sits between a desert and the Mediterranean Sea, so groundwater must be pumped from an aquifer. After years of overuse, even before the war began, 97 percent of the aquifer water didn’t meet quality standards from the World Health Organization. Making it safe to drink requires fuel, which isn’t abundant in Gaza. The other major reliable source of clean water is those pipes, three in total.In other words, the water supply in Gaza was already fragile even before the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Overnight, as Israel’s retaliatory bombing campaign began, the fuel required for water desalination became very scarce. Israel controls the flow of materials in and out of Gaza, and fuel has many potential wartime uses. Bardawil, meanwhile, kept his eye on those pipes. That first day, he called the engineer who was monitoring the central computer. Within two minutes, the cubic meters in all three had dropped down to zero.Sometimes neighbors show up at the apartment he is renting in South Gaza with his wife, children, and grandchildren. They figure that because he is Gaza’s water man, he must have some magic source of water he can tap. But this isn’t true. In fact, over the past couple of weeks, Bardawil himself has gone three stretches with no running water at all—just a couple of water bottles to share between the six adults and two children in his household.“We are not, you know, different from Israelis, Jordanians, Egyptians, Americans. And we deserve a life which is suitable for a human being,” he said. “We deserve a better life.”Listen to the conversation here:The following is a transcript of the episode:Hanna Rosin:Nearly every day this past week, I’ve talked on the phone with a man named Marwan.Rosin:His full name is Marwan Bardawil. He’s 60 and he lives in Gaza, where the phone connection is understandably spotty right now.Rosin:Marwan has a very specific job. He’s not a political or military figure. He’s not a foreign-policy expert or an activist. Marwan is an engineer, specifically a water engineer for the Palestinian Water Authority. And his job is to get water to the 2 million people that live in Gaza, which is hard, even in normal times.[Music]Rosin:Gaza sits between a dry desert and the salty Mediterranean, so they have to pump groundwater up from below. But over 97 percent of that water doesn’t meet the water-quality standards of the World Health Organization.It’s often salty, brackish, or contaminated. The plants needed to clean that water require fuel, which is in very short supply right now. And the only other major reliable source of clean water comes from three pipes controlled by Israel, which, the day the war started, Israel turned off.[Music]Rosin:I’m Hanna Rosin, and for this episode ofRadio Atlantic: my phone calls with Marwan as he tries to keep the water flowing in Gaza.The humanitarian crisis there right now is overwhelming. The Gaza Health Ministry says more than 8,700 people have been killed so far. Food and fuel are running out. And if Marwan can’t get enough water to the right places, it gets much worse.Rosin:Without enough clean water, people get dehydrated, hygiene deteriorates, sewage backs up. Palestinians are already crowded into schools and shelters, seeking refuge from the war. Take away clean water, and soon cholera and other deadly diseases could spike.[Music]Rosin:In the days after Hamas’s terror attack, Israel cut off utilities in Gaza.Rosin:So, when I began talking to Marwan last week, I wanted to know exactly what he saw at that moment.Rosin:With fuel about to be in short supply, these three pipes from Israel are Gaza’s lifeline.Rosin:But then several days later, one of the pipes got turned back on. It was a huge relief for Marwan. How or why they got one back, he’s not thinking about that. He’s just doing the math. Hospitals, houses, stores all need water. Two million people in Gaza need water. And one pipe is better than none.Rosin:At this point, it was Wednesday, October 25. And as we were talking, there was one functioning pipe. How many more days until there wouldn’t be enough clean water to go around?[Music]Rosin:A month ago, Marwan and his wife were empty nesters. Their son and daughter had both moved out, gotten married, and had children. They would visit at least once a week and occasionally take vacations together. Now, they’re all together in a small apartment in South Gaza. The kids are understandably confused.Where did our old rooms go? Why can’t we take a bath every night before bed, like we used to?The answer is not so kid-friendly and runs through Marwan’s head all day: They have a little more than one gallon of water for six adults and two children. And that has to last for two days.[Music]Rosin:Relatively speaking, he and his family are lucky. Marwan is able to pay for a private water company with a solar-powered desalination machine to fill up the building’s water tank once in a while. That is a luxury. When Israel started bombing Gaza, they told civilians in the north to move south, but about two-thirds of Gazans live below the poverty line. So unlike Marwan, many can’t afford to rent a temporary apartment in the south, much less buy private stores of water.Instead, a lot of Gazans are cramped into makeshift shelters in schools and hospitals. The way they get their water is they walk for miles, looking for an open water station, and then carry those gallon jugs back to the shelter. Even before this war, the majority of Gaza’s health problems came from contaminated water. Marwan hears from his engineers in the field that skin diseases are already starting to show up at the shelters. That’s a first sign of worse problems to come.Rosin:So, from the moment he wakes up, Marwan is on the phone to the Red Cross, to contacts in the West Bank, to engineers on the ground, to the UN, asking if there are any desalination plants working, if any pipes burst today. Should the water that day be diverted to the hospital? Or the bakeries? Or the shelters?Now, every once in a while, people show up at his door asking for water. They figure he works in the water authority. He must have access to some magic tap that keeps the water flowing in his apartment at all times.Rosin:Marwan has actually seen his own water run down to zero. A water engineer without running water relying on a couple of ordinary water bottles.Rosin:I call Marwan the next day. The math has accelerated.Rosin:That day started with a whole new problem: A pipe burst near a cluster of apartment buildings. An engineer in the field sent him a picture, which I asked Marwan to describe to me.Rosin:On a normal, non-wartime day, this is an easy problem. You call an emergency technician. They bring in a suction truck to clean up the mess, disinfect the area, and then replace the pipe. I asked him if he could do that now.[Music]Rosin:Marwan sometimes goes to conferences with Israeli water technicians. They share a border, which means they share some other things, like an aquifer, runoff, and pipes. At these conferences, Marwan says the tone is pretty collegial. They speak technical English, trading tips about water management.What’s unspoken is the power dynamic. Israel controls construction materials flowing in and out of Gaza, which are needed to repair and update these water systems.Nothing comes in or out without Israeli approval.Rosin:He’s never taken his grandkids to that beach. It was highly polluted by sewage water and un-swimmable for years. Although, a year ago, after a massive international cleanup effort, Gazans did start swimming there again, and many reported that for the first time in years, the water looked blue.I wanted to hear more about his childhood. But it was, by then, almost midnight Gaza time. Marwan was sounding tired, though he was too polite to say so.[Music]Rosin:I said goodnight and take care to Marwan. I would talk to him the next day. But then when I called, I heard a recording.Rosin:More from Gaza after the break.[Music]Rosin:Marwan explains to me how they felt that weekend, and the word he used wasblind. No calls in or out. No reaching the Red Cross or the UN. No reaching family. No reaching the guy who brings the water tank to their apartment. No way of knowing what was going on outside their walls. But now, with the phones back on, Marwan had work to do. He had to take care of a damaged pipeline.Rosin:This was on Monday. The Israelis had opened up a second pipe, and a spokesperson with the Israeli Defense Forces said that now, these two open pipes should provide enough water to meet basic humanitarian needs.But the second pipe was damaged, so Marwan had to find a technician to fix it. We reconnected later in the day.Rosin:It was a good moment. A quarter million people getting clean water would be a huge relief. But when we spoke the next day, the pipe still wasn’t running.And the first pipe, that one was down too. Marwan told me it was a technical issue. He said both should be running soon.But the reality was that for now, at the moment he and I were talking, they were back to where they’d been at the start of the war: zero pipes working.Rosin:Every time I called him, he seemed more exhausted, which makes complete sense. Gazans are depending on him. His neighbors are depending on him. His family is depending on him. He’s physically tired, but also just thoroughly exhausted.Rosin:“We are not the players of this game.” That evening, we talked some more. He told me about times he traveled to Europe to learn more about water management. And he told me he wasn’t sure his kids would want to raise their families in Gaza.After about 20 minutes, I wanted to let Marwan get some rest. He told me he was the only one still awake in his house. While we were talking, his wife, kids, and grandkids had all gone to sleep.[Music]Rosin:At the time of this recording—Wednesday, November 1—we couldn’t get the latest water update from Marwan. Gaza was under another communications blackout.This episode was produced by Kevin Townsend, edited by Claudine Ebeid, engineered by Rob Smeirciak, and fact-checked by Sam Fentress.

Cancel Culture Cuts Both Ways,2023-11-08,TheAtlantic,['Yascha Mounk'],"On October 13,The Onionsharedon X (formerly Twitter) the headline for a new satirical article: “Dying Gazans Criticized for Not Using Last Words to Condemn Hamas.” The tweet was liked by nearly 100,000 people.Within a couple of hours, Michael Eisen, a genetics professor at UC Berkeley and the editor ofeLife, an influential open-access journal for the life sciences, retweeted the post with thecommentthatTheOnion“speaks with more courage, insight and moral clarity than the leaders of every academic institution put together.” As Eisen told me in a recent phone interview, he did this “on Friday the 13th—I should have known that was a bad idea.”At first, reactions to Eisen’s tweet were muted. On X, a scientist asked Eisen, who is Jewish and has relatives in Israel, whether he condemned Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attack; in response to another post, Eisen wrote, “I condemn Hamas. I condemn the way Israel has treated Palestinians. I condemn the way one abhorrent act is used to justify another.” But then the responses to Eisen’s posts started to get heated. “I haven’t heard anyone criticising dying Gazans for not condemning Hamas,” one posterwrote. “I only heard people criticising smug, condescending American academics for not doing so.” Another poster shared ascreenshotof anold tweetin which Eisen had written “Fuck Israel.”"
Israel Has Already Lost,2023-07-27,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"In March,unprecedented outcrycompelled Israel’s government to pause its attempted overhaul of the country’s judiciary. But the reprieve was only temporary. At the time, the far-right ministersItamar Ben-GvirandBezalel Smotrichassured supporters that the reforms would pass by late July.This did not happen. Instead, on Monday, in the final week of the Israeli Parliament’s summer session, the ruling coalition passed the least significant component of its proposed legislation: curtailing the Supreme Court’s ability to use the “reasonableness standard” when reviewing government decisions. Contrary to the far right’s pledge, the government did not enact its plan to subordinate the appointment of Supreme Court judges to politicians. Nor did it grant the coalition the ability to override judicial decisions.In other words, Israel’s democracy—flawed as it is—remains intact, for now. Far from incapacitated, the country’s highest court is alreadyrushingto convene an unprecedented session to rule on the legality of this week’s effort to curb its powers. But whether or not Israel erodes its democratic guardrails in the months ahead, its people have already lost something similarly essential: basic social trust."
Netanyahu’s Attack on Democracy Left Israel Unprepared,2023-10-21,TheAtlantic,['Anne Applebaum'],"This summer I spent several days in Israel talking with people who were afraid for their country’s future. They were not, at that moment, focused on terrorism, Gaza, or Hamas. They feared something different: the emergence of an undemocratic Israel, a de facto autocracy. In January, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his justice minister had announced a package of judicial “reforms” that, taken together, would have given their coalition government the power to alter Israeli legal institutions to their own political benefit. Their motives were mixed. Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, was eager to stay out of jail. Some of his coalition partners wanted courts to stop hampering their plans to create new Israeli settlements on the West Bank, others to maintain military exemptions for Orthodox religious communities. All of them were interested in doing whatever it would take to stay in power, without the hindrance of an independent judiciary.In response, Israelis created a mass movement capable of organizing long marches and enormous weekly protests, every Saturday night, in cities and towns across the country. Unlike similar protest movements in other countries, this one did not peter out. Thanks to the financial and logistical support of the Israeli tech industry, the most dynamic economic sector in the country, as well as to organized teams of people coming from academia and the army reserves, the protests kept going for many months and successfully blocked some of the proposed legal changes. I was trying to understand why these Israeli protests had succeeded, and so I met tech-industry executives, army reservists, students, and one famous particle physicist, all of whom had participated in organizing and sustaining the demonstrations."
Beware the Language That Erases Reality,2023-10-18,TheAtlantic,['Gal Beckerman'],"George Orwell is forever the patron saint of language and the ways it can become degraded in times of war—when a split occurs between what is being inflicted on human beings, on human bodies, and the words of ideologues who want to keep us from seeing “what is in front of one’s nose,” as Orwell famously put it. His iconic essay on the topic,“Politics and the English Language,”argued that euphemism and jargon and the passive voice can be deployed to hide inconvenient truths. Consider, he wrote, “the comfortable English professor defending Russian totalitarianism.” The professor would not just come out plainly and say, “I believe in killing off your opponents when you can get good results by doing so.” Instead, he would go for something like this: “While freely conceding that the Soviet régime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.”A bullet in the back of the head would be lost in all that mishmash.The world has given us many examples of such disingenuous, vague, and purposely concealing language in the days since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. I could offer a long catalog of phrases that deny the humanity of Israelis and Palestinians—including Senator Tom Cotton’sinsistencethat Israel can “bounce the rubble” in Gaza with its bombs, as if children don’t live there, and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’shorrific descriptionof Palestinians as “human animals” (apparently he may have been referring only to Hamas, though the distinction was lost). But I want to focus on a subtler yet no less insidious example of language that dehumanizes:an open letterpublished inThe New York Review of Bookson Saturday and signed by more than 80 writers who are all past participants of the Palestine Festival of Literature, among them many prominent names, including Ta-Nehisi Coates, Richard Ford, Annie Baker, and Eileen Myles. I focus on this example because these novelists and playwrights and poets can be expected, unlike politicians, to be sensitive to the necessity for precision and clarity—words are their vocation—and because the statement they produced, out of an undoubtedly genuine and deep concern for the population of Gaza, would make Orwell spin in his grave."
Images of the Mass Kidnapping of Israelis by Hamas,2023-10-09,TheAtlantic,[''],"More accounts are emerging of kidnappings, rapes, and torture committed by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians. So far, at least 150 Israelis, most of them apparently civilians, were kidnapped by Hamas gunmen and stolen across Israel’s border with Gaza. Among the kidnapped are elderly women and small children. Human-rights groups are tracking these kidnappings as evidence of war crimes.Within hours of the attacks on Saturday, photos and videos began to circulate showing the mass murder of Israeli civilians—including people killed in their cars, and left dead on the ground in the streets and at a bus stop—as well as the kidnapping of children, young women, and the elderly. Two widely circulated videos have sparked outrage because of the apparent sexual assaults they depict,TheTimes of Israelreports.One video shows a woman who appears to have been beaten, and who seems to be bleeding into her shorts, being forced out of a Jeep in Gaza. The other video shows a woman, lateridentifiedby her family as 22-year-old Shani Louk, stripped down to her underwear and lying face down in a truck, her legs twisted at unnatural angles. Hamas gunmen sit on her body, and bystanders spit on it.According toThe Washington Post, Louk was kidnapped at a music festival where Hamas killed at least 260 people.Tabletmagazinereportsthat many of the women executed at the festival were raped “next to their friends’ bodies, dead bodies” before being killed. Some of those who survived were kidnapped and seen “paraded through the city’s streets” in Gaza by their captors, “blood gushing from between their legs,”Tabletreported."
The Three Myths of the Iran Deal,2019-07-18,TheAtlantic,['Michael Oren'],"The Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action—the nuclear deal with Iran—and its renewal of sanctions, the rise of Iran’s provocations in the Gulf and Iran’s enrichment of uranium have together reignited the debate over how best to meet the multiple threats posed by Iran. Once again, the proponents of using military force against Iran are squaring off against the advocates of diplomacy. Though the debate is primarily an internal American dispute, the people it will most profoundly affect are the Iranians, Arabs, and Israelis who will live with the consequences of any decision made by the United States.The majority of Israelis and Arabs would agree that negotiations are preferable to war with Iran, but only if they put an end to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, its support for terror and construction of intercontinental missiles, and its campaign to dominate or destroy other states in the region. As a former Israeli official, I have a deep interest in avoiding a conflict likely to result in massive civilian casualties on both sides. As a historian who opposed America’s invasion of Iraq, even testifying against it in Congress, I know the hazards of war making in the Middle East. But diplomacy will be fruitless, and war eventually guaranteed, if the illusions surrounding the JCPOA persist."
Steve Scalise Bows Out,2023-10-13,TheAtlantic,['Russell Berman'],"When Representative Steve Scalise emerged yesterday from the private party meeting where House Republicans narrowly nominated him to serve as the next speaker, he sounded anxious to get started. “We need to send a message to people throughout the world that the House is open and doing the people’s business,” Scalisetold reporters.The Louisiana Republican wanted an immediate floor vote so that his members could formally elect him in a party-line tally. He had reason to hurry: The pile of problems—both global and domestic—that Congress must address is growing fast, and the House can do nothing without an elected speaker. The federal government will shut down on November 17 if lawmakers don’t act. Ukraine needs more funding from the U.S., and Israel, suddenly at war with Hamas, could soon as well.Scalise’s Republican foes, however, weren’t giving in. He needed the support of 217 of the House’s 221 GOP members in order to win the speakership, and defections began popping up almost immediately. Today more Republicans came out in opposition to his bid, and this evening Scalise announced that he was withdrawing from the race. His time as the Republican nominee lasted less than a day and a half."
Why Jihadists Loved America in the 1980s,2020-03-06,TheAtlantic,['Thomas Hegghammer'],"It was freezing cold with gusting winds in Indianapolis on New Year’s Day 1978. While much of the city was presumably waking to a hangover, the Islamic Teaching Center was busy hosting prominent preachers from the Middle East. Among them was Abdallah Azzam, a 36-year-old rising star of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood. In Indianapolis, Azzam wouldmeeta young Saudi student with a now-famous name: Osama bin Laden. It was a historic moment, one that marked the rise of an extensive jihadist network in the United States.That Azzam and bin Laden met in America is no coincidence. They came because, unlike other countries in the Middle East, the U.S. allowed them and other Islamists to preach, fundraise, and recruit followers without interference. My newbiographyof Azzam shows that in the 1980s, radical Islamists exploited U.S. territory to an extent not previously recognized. In fact, for more than a decade, America was among the most hospitable jihadist-recruitment grounds in the world."
Israel’s Tectonic Struggle,2023-03-16,TheAtlantic,['Michael Oren'],"Last Thursday night, the sirens started wailing in Tel Aviv, the telltale sign of an attack. My first thought wasPlease, God, let it be a terrorist.Better the familiar trauma of Palestinian terror than the novel horror of Jews shooting at Jews, igniting civil war. Because such a nightmare these days indeed seems conceivable.Hundreds of thousands of Israelis take to the streets on a nightly basis to protest the government’s judicial-reform initiative, which they believe will strip Israel of democracy and permanently install dictatorial, racist, and, in some cases, criminal politicians. But to many of the millions of Israelis remaining at home, the demonstrations represent something else—a last-ditch attempt by an embittered elite to regain the power it lost at the polls.As these resentments mount, and the danger of internecine conflict increases, friends are asking me whether we’re witnessing a replay of the year 70 C.E., when Rome besieged Jerusalem while the Jews inside descended into fratricide.My mother, a former family therapist, was fond of saying that the presenting problem is not the most serious problem, and that is emphatically true about Israel today. Those opposing the reforms, mostly from the political center and the left but with a significant representation from the moderate right, genuinely fear for Israel’s soul. They want to raise their children in this country and are willing to fight for its future. Many are threatening to leave the state entirely if the government destroys its democracy. “Let’s see how long those fascists survive without us,” a business associate of mine declared, pointing to the prominence of high-tech professionals and veterans of elite military units in the protests. “Israel will become Lebanon.”"
India’s Hindu Extremists Are Trolling the Israel Conflict,2023-10-26,TheAtlantic,['Vaibhav Vats'],"Shortly after midnight on October 8, Mohammed Zubair, a fact-checking journalist based in Bangalore, came across a video on X (formerly Twitter). Less than a day had elapsed since the Hamas attacks in Israel, but the caption on the post claimed that Palestinians had shot down four Israeli helicopters in Gaza. Zubair had seen similar footage dozens of times before—from the simulation video gameArma 3, passed off as visuals from the Ukraine war.Zubair lives in close quarters with his parents, wife, and children; his only time for solitary concentration is when his kids are asleep. As part of his daily work routine, he scours the internet for fake news and propaganda for an hour after midnight. To him, October 8 felt different: The deluge of disinformation he spotted on Indian social media left him stunned. “The scale of misinformation this time was horrific and unimaginable,” Zubair told me.A grimvideoof a beheading by a Mexican drug cartel was shared as an attack on Israeli citizens. A nine-year-oldphotographof Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his son, taken before the latter departed for his military service, was portrayed as the leader sending his offspring to war.Footageof a funeral staged in Jordan to evade a pandemic lockdown was misrepresented as Palestinians faking deaths in Gaza. A 2014videoof the Islamic State destroying a mosque in Syria was labeled as the Israeli bombing of a Palestinian mosque."
The Axis of Resistance Has Been Gathering Strength,2023-10-24,TheAtlantic,['Michael Young'],"For the first time since 2006, the Lebanese are again facing the prospect of a devastating war with Israel, on the back of the current conflict in Gaza. Much of the population does not want, and knows it cannot afford, such a war. Lebanon is stillin the throes of an economic collapsethat began in 2019. Yet Hezbollah, which dominates Lebanon’s political scene, seems moved less by what its countrymen want than by the strategic priorities of its sponsor, Iran.The Iranians have worked painstakingly in the past decade to build up a redoubtable deterrence capability on Israel’s borders with Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza. Hezbollah realizes that a full-scale conflict might weaken its hold over Lebanon and will try to avoid such an outcome. But ultimately, the party will follow Iran’s lead.Earlier this year, Hezbollah’s secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, began referring to a“unification of the fronts”strategy. The idea was that Iran-backed armed groups, joined into the so-called Axis of Resistance, would coordinate operations against Israel, especially in defense of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Last May, amid clashes in Gaza between Islamic Jihad and Israel, Nasrallahdescribed what this meant in practical terms: “The real headline for the resistance response in Gaza is [the creation of] a joint operations room for the resistance groups.”"
‘He’ll Ruin Your Life the Way His Daddy Ruined Ours’,2023-09-10,TheAtlantic,['Esau McCaulley'],"My father and mother metin the winter of 1976. I’ve seen photos. There they are, looking as young and untroubled as any two high-school students on a Friday-night date. Not yet parents, not yet weighed down with the responsibility of caring for four children, both are smiling, my father standing behind my mother, who sits on a stool with her head nestled into his chest.My parents were introduced by my father’s cousin Larry, whose easy smile and welcoming personality marked him as a charmer. Larry and my mom attended school at J. O. Johnson High in Huntsville, Alabama, where he was two years ahead of her. Intrigued by the sly older boy, my mother dated him, but after the second outing, she opted to let him down easy by introducing him to her friend Wanda. Larry, in turn, suggested that my mother meet his cousin Esau, who went to school out in the country, at Gurley High.On that first date, my mother was instantly drawn to my father’s tenderness. She would come to know him as outgoing and funny, but that night he acted shy and polite. They spent the evening parked at a drive-in movie. In the front seat, Larry and Wanda were hitting it off. Larry turned to Esau and said, “Go ahead, cousin, lean in and give her a kiss.”"
Iran's Real Enemy in Syria,2018-04-16,TheAtlantic,['Karim Sadjadpour'],"“What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children?” President Trump asked Russia and Iran Friday night after launching air strikes against the Syrian regime. “The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep.”Despite his speechwriters’ best efforts, if there is one thing Donald Trump and Iran share it is an inability to be shamed. Over the last seven years no country has done more, financially and militarily, to back the Bashar al-Assad regime’s mass murder of Syrians than the Islamic Republic of Iran, a theocracy that claims to rule from a moral high ground. Within hours of joint American, French, and British targeted military strikes in Syria, Iranian president Hassan RouhanicalledAssad to pledge his solidarity.At a time of great economic hardship in Iran, Tehran has provided billions of dollars to arm, train, and pay tens of thousands of Arab, Afghan, and Pakistani Shia militants help Assad crush Sunni Islamist rebels. Tehran, the victim of heinous chemical weapons attacks by Saddam Hussein three decades ago, hasprovidedAssad the means to deliver these same weapons, while simultaneously denying that he uses them. The question is why?Distilled to its essence, Tehran’s steadfast support for Assad is not driven by the geopolitical or financial interests of the Iranian nation, nor the religious convictions of the Islamic Republic, but by a visceral and seemingly inextinguishable hatred for the state of Israel. As senior Iranian officials like Ali Akbar Velayati, a close adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have commonlysaid, “The chain of Resistance against Israel by Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, the new Iraqi government and Hamas passes through the Syrian highway. … Syria is the golden ring of the chain of resistance against Israel.” So long as the 78-year-old Khamenei remains in power, this hatred will justify Tehran’s continued commitment of blood and treasure to support Assad’s use of all means necessary—including chemical weapons—to preserve his rule.Though Israel has virtually no direct impact on the daily lives of Iranians, opposition to the Jewish state has been the most enduring pillar of Iranian revolutionary ideology. Whether Khamenei is giving a speech about agriculture or education, he invariably returns to the evils of Zionism. “The Zionist regime is a true cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off,” Khameneisaidin a 2012 speech. “We will support and help any nations, any groups fighting against the Zionist regime across the world.” Given Israel’s military superiority, Khamenei’s stated strategy is not Israel’s short-term annihilation, but its long-term political dissolution. “If Muslims and Palestinians unite and all fight,” he commonly says, “the Zionist regime will not be in existence in 25 years.”"
How Did UNESCO Get So Politicized? ,2017-10-12,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"The United States will formally withdraw from UNESCO, the State Department announced Thursday, citing concerns over the UN cultural agency’s perceived anti-Israel bias. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert also cited the U.S.’s mounting dues owed to UNESCO—now over$500 million—as reason for its departure. Shesaidthe decision “was not taken lightly” and that the U.S. would continue to offer its perspective as a non-member observer state.The decision was met with “profound regret” by UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova, whocalledthe U.S. withdrawal from the agency known for its designation of world heritage sites “a loss to UNESCO. This is a loss to the United Nations family. This is a loss for multilateralism.”The move follows years of tensions between the cultural body and the U.S. over decisions involving Israel and Palestine. In 2011, the Obama administration slashed U.S. funding to UNESCO after it admitted Palestine as a full member. The relationship was further strained last year after Israel suspended its cooperation with UNESCO over its adoption of a resolution the Israeli government saiddeniedJewish ties to Jerusalem’s holy sites. A resolution passed by the agency in Julydeclaringthe West Bank city of Hebron and its Tomb of the Patriarchs a Palestinian World Heritage Site caused similar ire."
Hamas May Not Have a Step Two,2023-10-11,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"A U.S. intelligence officer once told me that his boss would often send back his reports about Iranian terror operations with one crucial question:Why now?Why were the Iranians hatching this particular plot now, instead of last year or five years in the future? This question is good, and the answer is the beginning of any good strategic analysis. But the analyst was frustrated. Even in intelligence, it is possible to overthink things. “Why now?” he said. “Because they are a fucking terrorist group.And all they do, every day, is think of ways to kill Americans and our allies. Sometimes that’s all there is to it.”Hours after Hamas broke through the Gaza barrier, I asked whether we were witnessing Step One of a plan that would perhaps involve Hezbollah and a front in the north—and even further moves that would threaten to break Israeli defenses altogether. Israel rapidly reinforced its northern border to prevent that, and according to reports, Hezbollah was warned that any shenanigans would be answered with the leveling of Damascus. Such phased escalations would have had their most devastating effect if they came when Israel was at its most confused and traumatized, and before it mobilized its reserves. Now that its reservists are in place, escalation seems unlikely to happen, at least not in the coordinated strategic way that could cause Israel’s collapse. (Northern Israel went on alert tonight after reported incursions into its airspace, but this did not amount to Hezbollah’s decisive entry into the war.) As the strategist Edward Luttwak has pointed out, Israel tends to start wars badly and end them well, because its strength lies in its reserves, and activating them and getting them on task takes a few days or weeks."
The Real Dispute Driving the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,2018-05-14,TheAtlantic,['Yossi Klein Halevi'],"As the U.S. moves its embassy to Jerusalem, and the tragedy at the Gaza border escalates, Israelis and Palestinians continue to contest each other’s rights not just to that city, but to legitimacy itself.On April 30, Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian Authority, provoked an international uproar when he delivered a speech before the Palestinian National Council in which he blamed the Holocaust on Jewish “social behavior” like greedy banking practices. The European Union promptly denounced Abbas; former Secretary of State John Kerrytweetedthat there can be “no excuses for antisemitism” [sic]; the dovish Jewish organization J Streetwarnedthat “diatribes like this” undermine legitimate Palestinian aspirations; and aNew York Timeseditorialcalled for his resignation. In fact, Abbas’s contempt for Holocaust historicity was hardly new: His 1982 doctoral thesis trafficked in outright Holocaust denial, questioning the number of victims and claiming that Zionists collaborated with the Nazis.But the international community missed a more consequential affront in Abbas’s speech: the denial of the Jewish people’s rootedness in the land it shares with the Palestinian people. “Their narrative about coming to this country because of their longing for Zion, or whatever—we’re tired of hearing this,” Abbas told the Palestinian National Council. “The truth is that this is a colonialist enterprise, aimed at planting a foreign body in this region.”"
What U.S. Intelligence Thought 2020 Would Look Like,2019-12-31,TheAtlantic,['Uri Friedman'],"In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook. George W. Bush was reelected president of the United States. And American intelligence analysts consulted with hundreds of experts across five continents to try to predict what the world would look like in 2020.The result, a119-page reportby the National Intelligence Council titled “Mapping the Global Future,” is an eerie and illuminating read with 2020 now upon us. The authors, led by Mathew Burrows, then a top official at the council, sensed that the world was approaching an inflection point, even if they didn’t yet know what role the United States would play in it. “At no time since the formation of the Western alliance system in 1949 have the shape and nature of international alignments been in such a state of flux,” they wrote.As with mostexpert predictions, the intelligence officials got plenty wrong about our present era. But they got a lot at least partially right, an indication that not everything about the world today is as unpredictable as it might seem. While the analysts at the National Intelligence Council may not have seen President Donald Trump coming 15 years ago, they anticipated Trumpism. They didn’t expect the United States to voluntarily reduce its presence in the world, but they grasped that its clout was eroding. They missed the Islamic State, but foresaw the conditions in which ISIS arose."
When Anti-Zionism Is Anti-Semitic,2023-11-08,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"On October 7, the terrorist group Hamas perpetrated the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. More than 1,400 Israelis were murdered and kidnapped, overwhelmingly civilians, including babies and Holocaust survivors. Children were shot in front of their parents. Parents were killed in front of their children. Families were incinerated in their homes.Hamas, whichfilmedmany of its atrocities andpostedthem on social media, hasnever been shyabout its motivations. Itscharteruses “Jews” and “Zionists” interchangeably; claims that Jews control “the world media, news agencies, the press, publishing houses, [and] broadcasting stations”; and promises “struggle against the Jews” and the destruction of Israel. Last week, a spokesperson for the groupvowedthat “we will repeat the October 7 attack time and again until Israel is annihilated.” Not all anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism, but the anti-Zionism of Hamas certainly is.The same is true of Hamas’s far more powerful sponsor, Iran. Whether or not Tehran directly ordered the October massacre, no one disputes that the regime is theprimary funder and supplierof Hamas, whose wanton violence it publiclycelebrated. Iran’s theocratic rulers are similarly open about their genocidal ambitions. They havebuilta physical countdown clock to Israel’s destruction, have been accused ofplottingterrorist attacks against Jews around the world, and evenhostedcartoon contests for Holocaust deniers and other anti-Semites. Iran’s military has displayed missilesemblazonedwithDeath to Israelin Hebrew."
‘Be Absolutely Quiet. Not a Word.’,2023-10-11,TheAtlantic,['Hanna Rosin'],"The Israeli journalist Amir Tibon and his family were trapped inside a safe room in their house on the Israel-Gaza border when they heard gunshots outside. Tibon speaks Arabic, so he knew what was happening. Hamas terrorists had somehow made it into their Israeli village. Tibonspoke with me and my colleague Yair Rosenbergabout the experience, and in this episode ofRadio Atlanticwe hear Tibon’s story—hiding out with his two young children, their improbable rescue—and his first, raw thoughts about why this happened to them.Listen to the conversation here:The following is a transcript of the episode:Amir Tibon:Saturday, six in the morning, and we hear a very familiar sound: the sound of a mortar about to explode. It’s like a whistle. It’s almost like this [whistles].Tibon:You wait sometimes an hour. You pack your bags.And when there is a break, a few minutes, you just shove the kids in the car and you go away from the border toward a more secure place. But this time, as we were packing, I heard the most chilling noise I’ve heard in my life: automatic gunfire in the distance.Tibon:So at first I’m hearing this gunfire from the fields. But then I hear it from the road. And then I hear it from the neighborhood. And then I hear it outside my window. And I hear shouting. And I understand Arabic; I understood exactly what was happening. Basically, I understood that Hamas has infiltrated our kibbutz, that there are terrorists outside my window, and I’m locked in my house and inside my safe room with two young girls, and I don’t know if anyone is going to come to save us.That’s how it started.Tibon:And what Amos told me in reply was the scariest thing I heard. He said, “Yes, I know, but it’s not only in your kibbutz. It’s not only in Nachal Oz. It’s all over southern Israel. It’s all over. It’s in cities and in towns and in kibbutzim and in villages. Thousands of armed Hamas fighters have infiltrated the country. They’ve taken over military bases.”And that was scary because I realized, if that’s the situation, it will take a very long time for the military to come and confront these terrorists and save us.That’s where I thought,Okay, we’re going to die here. Nobody’s going to be able to come in time. And if they manage to break into the house, they will then try to break into the safe room. And if they manage to do that, we will be dead or kidnapped.Tibon:“You have to be absolutely quiet, not a word. You can’t cry, can’t talk. It’s dangerous.”Tibon:I have neighbors who are dead. I have neighbors who are injured. I have neighbors that we don’t know where they are, you know—may have been kidnapped, held by Hamas. I’m not thinking right now about, you know, the bigger implications of this in terms of our future.Tibon:My parents said, “We’re coming. We’re coming to get you.” Now, this goes against all logic, but I told myself, okay, right now I’m asking my two young daughters to put complete faith in me and my wife, in their parents. To do what we’re telling them in order to save their lives, which is to be very, very, very quiet and understand that we cannot get out of the room, we cannot go get food, we cannot go to the bathroom, we cannot go out to play.And I’m asking them to put their faith in me completely. And I told myself, I have to do the same thing right now. I have to trust my father, who is a trustworthy man, that if he said he will come here and save us, he will do it.Tibon:They get out of the car. My father has a pistol. And he and this other soldier join the soldiers who are fighting the Hamas cell. They help kill them. And now they’re very close to my kibbutz. They’re like five minutes from the entrance to my kibbutz. But two of the soldiers are wounded.Tibon:So these two guys, over the age of 60, are driving in a regular car. It’s not even a jeep or something. It’s not an armored vehicle. It’s just a car. Like They’re driving now on the road where half an hour earlier there was a deadly ambush of soldiers. And they reach the entrance to the kibbutz and when they get there they meet a group of soldiers from special forces who are about to begin the very dangerous process of going from house to house in our community, to try to engage the terrorists and release the people who are barricaded.And by that point, I have no idea that all of this is happening. We are in the safe room. The terrorists are still outside. And we have no cell reception. We’re just waiting in the dark. But we start hearing gunfire again. And this time, it’s—we hear it’s two kinds of guns. And we realize there is a battle. We realize that there is an exchange of fire. And I tell my wife, “He’s coming. My father is coming. They’re fighting. He’s with the soldiers.”They didn’t come immediately to our house. They went from house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood, inside our community. I don’t remember how long it took, I have to say. We were just hearing that the gunfire were getting closer and closer. And the girls had fallen asleep, but now they woke up. It’s, I think, maybe 2 p.m. They haven’t had anything to eat since last night. They don’t see us at this point. There’s no light and we don’t have cellphones anymore.And there’s one sentence that is keeping them from falling apart and starting to cry. I’m telling them, “Grandfather is coming.” I tell them, “If we stay quiet, your grandfather will come and get us out of here.” And at 4 p.m., after 10 hours like this, we hear a large bang on the window. And we hear the voice of my father and Galia, my oldest daughter, says, “Saba Hegia.”Grandfather arrived.And that’s when we all just start crying. And that’s when we knew that we were safe.Tibon:You live in a place like Nachal Oz, you wake up every morning, and you know there are people on the other side of the border who want to kill you and your children, basically. And so we were there all these years. And the contract was, again, we protect the border and the state protects us. And this government, which is the worst government in the history of the state of Israel, led by a corrupt, dysfunctional, and egoistic man who sees only himself, Benjamin Netanyahu, failed us.The way that the events of the day unfolded are the worst failure in the history of the state of Israel. I mean, people like my father, like other retired officers, coming down to save citizens, to try to save their own families and others, and meanwhile, the military is falling apart. And all the civilian infrastructure that is supposed to support the military and the society in such an event is also not functioning.Listen, right now we have to win this war. We have to destroy Hamas. We have to make it impossible for them to ever, ever again conduct anything that is even close to what happened on Saturday. No country in the world can allow something like this to happen to its citizens and just go to business as usual. And I feel bad for the people of Gaza, I have to say. I feel very, very bad for the people of Gaza. I’m sad; I’m heartbroken. But the response Israel will have to take will be completely disproportionate to anything we’ve seen in the past because this was a disproportionate event. This was our 9/11.And after we win the war and we, you know, eradicate Hamas, there will be time also to throw into the dustbin of history any politician, starting with the prime minister, who had anything to do with this failure.And there is a new reality between Israel and Gaza. That reality, it can be, you know, the result of a disastrous military operation. It can be a result of some diplomatic maneuvers as well, but it cannot remain the same situation.Tibon:It cannot include Hamas. I don’t know what it will be, but Hamas, which in the past people considered as perhaps, you know, maybe we can talk to them, maybe we can do—it cannot include Hamas. I don’t know what it looks like but Hamas lost any shred of possibility of ever becoming a normal partner for anything.It’s true that Gaza is also home to more than 2 million people, and they’re going to stay there. And we’re going to have to think about what that means, and how in the long run there could be a better future for them as well and a future that will also make it better for us.But that’s a conversation for tomorrow. It’s not the conversation for today.Rosin:This episode ofRadio Atlanticwas produced by Kevin Townsend and edited by Claudina Ebeid. Claudine is also the executive producer ofAtlanticAudio.

My Message of Peace,2023-11-04,TheAtlantic,['Ziad Asali'],"This is the time to address Israelis in the spirit of mutual respect, hope, and truthfulness; to move beyond the dismissive, derogatory, and threatening words and deeds that define the relationship between Palestinians and Israelis, and between Arabs and Jews.I was born and raised in Jerusalem. I started out as a Palestinian, then became a Palestinian Jordanian, then an immigrant to America, and then an American, now for more than half a century. But nothing—not time, not distance—has diluted my empathy with the Palestinians and Palestine, and nothing has altered my view that all people have rights and deserve to be treated with respect. During my medical residency in the U.S., I met American Jewish doctors who shared my interests and curiosity, if not necessarily my views. Some of them remain my good friends to this day. I have been fortunate in my work, at the American Task Force on Palestine, to develop treasured and enduring friendships with many Jewish people of different nationalities, including Israelis. It is in this very American spirit that I address Israelis today.I must start by noting that our family lost everything in Jerusalem in 1948. We survived and even thrived, but this loss is a core truth of my family’s history. Yet even as I have lived Palestinian pain, I have made an effort to study and understand Jewish pain, which is primordial and deep."
The U.S. Is Sidelining Itself in the Middle East,2018-08-31,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"The Trump administration isreportedlyending all funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and calling for a dramatic change in how Palestinian refugees are counted, effectively reducing the number of Palestinians the United States considers refugeesfrom around 5 million to fewer than 500,000,TheWashington Postreported.What this effectively does is end for most Palestinians the UN-backed “right of return” to land they or their ancestors fled in 1948, when the state of Israel was created, and 1967, when Israel defeated a combined Arab military force in the Six-Day War. (Neither Israel nor the U.S. recognizes the “right of return,” which remains a key sticking point in the peace process.)Just who counts as a Palestinian refugee is a matter of controversy for the Trump administration and some Israelis. UNRWA counts those Palestinians who were displaced from the region in the 1948 and 1967 wars, as well as their descendants—even if they possess the citizenship of the Arab country to which their ancestors fled—as refugees. This policy has resulted in 5 million Palestinians with refugee status. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN refugee agency, on the other hand, counts the world’s other refugees differently: A refugee’s descendant with the citizenship of another country is not considered a refugee. As Jay Sekulow, the president’s counsel,wrote inForeign Policy, Palestinians are the only class of refugees in the world accorded that status purely because of their descent, adding: “There is no provision for refugee status based on descent in the 1951 refugee convention or in internationally accepted practices for refugees who are not Palestinian refugees.” Some Israelis point out that the potential return of 5 million refugees to Israel would dramatically alter their country’s demographics. Palestinians want the issue to be resolved as part of a final negotiation with Israel on a two-state solution."
Elon Musk’s Latest Target Hits Back,2023-09-08,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"Over the past few days, hundreds of thousands of posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, have lambasted a Jewish organization that many people are only vaguely aware of: the Anti-Defamation League. The #BanTheADL campaign, started by overtwhitenationalistsand later boosted by Elon Musk himself, accuses the Jewish civil-rights group of seeking to censor the site’s users, intimidate its advertisers, and generally abrogate American freedoms in service of a sinister liberal agenda.I’m pretty familiar with the ADL. Like many reporters and subject-matter experts on anti-Semitism, I’ve spoken at some of the organization’s events. I haven’t always agreed with its approach, whether on social-media moderation or Israel. But though the ADL doesn’t get everything right, it has abetter batting averagethan most organizations in this difficult space. In any case, as Iwroteearlier this week, none of what is happening to the group today has much to do with the specific policies it advocates, whatever their merits. Rather, the ADL is being scapegoated on Twitter for the platform’s own failings, and attacked as a stand-in for supposed Jewish power.In an effort to disentangle criticism from conspiracy, I spoke last night with the ADL’s CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, about his organization’s approach to free speech, how he attempts to represent a Jewish consensus in such a polarized time, and whether the ADL is secretly trying to strangle Twitter.This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity."

For support and resources, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text 741-741 for the Crisis Text Line.After Anthony Bourdain’s death, a particular kind of tribute proliferated in my social media feeds. Post after post eulogized the chef, who through his writing and globetrotting TV shows became an ambassador of the world to the United States, for his unflinching honesty and political conviction. Bourdain used his tremendous platform to explain to his audience how their own lives were entangled with those of other people.In Laos for an episode of his CNN show,Parts Unknown, he excoriated theCIA-waged “secret war”that left the country strewn with unexploded ordnance, which still kill dozens of Laotians every year. He insisted on the humanity of people in Gaza and Iran, places rarely humanized in the American imagination. He always stressed his solidarity with undocumented workers after working for years in the restaurant industry. From Henry Kissinger to Donald Trump, Pol Pot to Mobutu, he never minced words in damning the powerful."
The Roots of the Latest Palestinian Uprising ,2015-10-16,TheAtlantic,['Jeffrey Goldberg'],"In September of 1928, a group of Jewish residents of Jerusalemplaced a benchin front of the Western Wall of the Temple Mount, for the comfort of elderly worshipers. They also brought with them a wooden partition, to separate the sexes during prayer. Jerusalem’s Muslim leaders treated the introduction of furniture into the alleyway in front of the Wall as a provocation, part of a Jewish conspiracy to slowly take control of the entire Temple Mount.Many of the leaders of Palestine’s Muslims believed—or claimed to believe—that Jews had manufactured a set of historical and theological connections to the Western Wall and to the Mount, the site of the al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock, in order to advance the Zionist project. This belief defied Muslim history—the Dome of the Rock was built by Jerusalem’s Arab conquerors on the site of the Second Jewish Temple in order tovenerate its memory(the site had previously been defiled by Jerusalem’s Christian rulers as a kind of rebuke to Judaism, the despised mother religion of Christianity). Jews themselves consider the Mount itself to be the holiest site in their faith. The Western Wall, a large retaining wall from the Second Temple period, is sacred only by proxy.The spiritual leader of Palestine’s Muslims, the mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, incited Arabs in Palestine against their Jewish neighbors by arguing that Islam itself was under threat. (Husseini would later becomeone of Hitler’smost important Muslim allies.) Jews in British-occupied Palestine responded to Muslim invective by demanding more access to the Wall, sometimes holding demonstrations at the holy site. By the next year,violencedirected against Jews by their neighbors had become more common: Arab rioters took the lives of 133 Jews that summer; British forces killed 116 Arabs in their attempt to subdue the riots. In Hebron, adevastating pogromwas launched against the city’s ancient Jewish community after Muslim officialsdistributedfabricated photographs of a damaged Dome of the Rock, and spread the rumor that Jews had attacked the shrine.The current “stabbing Intifada” now taking place in Israel—a quasi-uprising in which young Palestinians have been trying, and occasionally succeeding, to kill Jews with knives—is prompted in good part by the same set of manipulated emotions that sparked the anti-Jewish riots of the 1920s: a deeply felt desire on the part of Palestinians to “protect” the Temple Mount from Jews.When Israel captured the Old City of Jerusalem in June of 1967 in response to a Jordanian attack, the first impulse of some Israelis was to assert Jewish rights atop the Mount. Between 1948, the year Israel achieved independence, and 1967, Jordan, then the occupying power in Jerusalem, banned Jews not only from the 35-acre Mount—which is known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif, the noble sanctuary—but also from the Western Wall below. When paratroopers took the Old City, they raised the Israeli flag atop the Dome of the Rock, but the Israeli defense minister, Moshe Dayan, ordered it taken down, and soon after promised leaders of the Muslim Waqf, the trust that controlled the mosque and the shrine, that Israel would not interfere in its activities. Since then, successive Israeli governments have maintained the status quo established by Dayan."
"Yes, the U.S. Can Afford to Help Its Allies",2023-10-20,TheAtlantic,['David Frum'],"As his addressto the nation from the Oval Office last nightunderlined, President Joe Biden is expected to send a defense-appropriations request to Congress for perhaps as much as $100 billion to support Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, and to improve U.S. border security. It’s a big request—and it will galvanize a debate about whether the United States is doing too much.Existing critics of Ukraine aid are already complaining that to add an effort to resupply Israel will prove too crushing. Is that true?Let’s carefully tally American resources and American commitments.Thanks to its remarkable rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, the American economywill this year produce$27 trillion in goods and services. In the fiscal year that ended on September 30, the U.S.spent about$850 billion of that $27 trillion on national defense. That rounds out at a little more than 3 percent of GDP. That’s only about half of the burden of defense spending that the U.S.shoulderedduring the final decade of the Cold War."
A Country Shaped by Love and Fear,2023-08-31,TheAtlantic,['Robert Zaretsky'],"Popular sentiment has a rolein the political life of all nations, but the Jewish state, born after two millennia of persecution and yearning, offers a particularly strong case study in how emotion can affect politics—underlying everything from ideology to the drawing of lines on a map. The last six months alone has seen a surge of strong sentiment, ironically, over the question of who gets to decide whether a particular law is“reasonable.”The streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem have filled with passionate protesters, their faces distorted by crying or yelling, waving giant flags as water cannons force them off their feet. And the debate has been colored as much by argument as by resentment, anxiety, pride, and a plethora of other potent feelings.Two new books, Eva Illouz’sThe Emotional Life of Populismand Derek Penslar’sZionism: An Emotional State, zero in on those emotions, like love and fear, which are so seldom acknowledged for what they are but play an outsize role in shaping politics.Though written from different angles—Illouz is a prominent sociologist, and Penslar is a distinguished historian—both echo the brilliantUpheavals of Thought: The Intelligence of Emotions, by the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, that “emotions are not just the fuel that powers the psychological mechanism of a reasoning creature, they are parts, highly complex and messy parts, of this creature’s reasoning itself.”"
The Rare Sight of a Political Reckoning,2020-10-30,TheAtlantic,['Helen Lewis'],"These days, it is rare that a piece of political news can make your jaw drop. But the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn from Britain’s Labour Party lit up social media—and my phone—like a fireworks display.Until April, Corbyn was the leader of Britain’s main opposition party. (He stood down less than four months after leading Labour to athumping general-election defeatlast year.) The man who replaced him, former lawyer Keir Starmer, supported the punishment.The immediate cause of Corbyn’s suspension was his reaction toan independent report, published this week by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, a British watchdog group, on anti-Semitism within the Labour Party. The report found that his office had interfered with complaints about anti-Semitic postings and comments, objected to an investigation into Corbyn himself, and contributed to a hostile environment for Jews in the party. Significantly, it found that the offenses amounted to three breaches of equalities law. One section was entitled “A Failure of Leadership.”"
Palestinian High Court Rules Elections to Be Held in West Bank Only ,2016-10-03,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"Updated on October 3 at 1:00 p.m. ESTNEWS BRIEFThe Palestinian Supreme Court announced Monday municipal elections will be held exclusively in the West Bank, reversing expectations the election would take place throughout the Palestinian territories.Last month the high court suspended the October 8 municipal elections, citing concerns with voting irregularities in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, as well as theexclusionof East Jerusalemfrom the electoral process,according toWafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency.Israel permitted limited voting in East Jerusalem in 2006, the last time elections were held,but in July said it wouldn’tallow elections to take place in areas of Jerusalem deemed under its sovereignty. Israel annexed East Jerusalem, which Palestinians claim as their future capital, following the war of 1967, a move that has not been recognized under international law.Hamas, which Israel and the U.S. regard as a terrorist group,rejected the court’s decision,calling it discriminatory and politically motivated."
‘There Will Probably Be a Cease-Fire. And Then They Will Just Be Names.’,2023-11-04,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"Earlier this week, while walking through central Jerusalem, I heard a chant in the distance. War has driven away tourists, and in a tourist city without tourists, sounds carry far. The discernible portion of the chant was a single word in Hebrew,akshav—“now.” I followed the sound to Safra Square, where a crowd had gathered, yelling in sorrow and fury, to protest the kidnapping of more than 240 people, most of them Israelis, by Hamas.Survivors from Kibbutz Nir Oz (which lost a quarter of its population in the October 7 pogrom) had taken over Safra Square and installed an exhibit consisting of beds, neatly made, for each of the hostages currently in Gaza. They were arranged in a grid. Some were queen beds. Others were singles. Some had books on nightstands nearby. Several were IKEA cribs, for the dozens of children among the captives. One didn’t need to know even that one word of Hebrew to figure out what the crowd was demanding—the return of the hostages, without delay—and what it was promising: the creation of a civic movement that will continue screaming at the Israeli government, in anger and recrimination, until the hostages are back.I spoke with relatives of six of the Nir Oz hostages whose kidnappings were captured on video that spread within hours of the attack. The abductees are Shiri Silberman-Bibas, 32, who was kidnapped with her husband, Yarden, and two young children; Tamir Adar, 38, a young father last seen sealing his family into their safe room; and Yaffa Adar, 85. If you saw images of the kidnappings on the day of the attack, these were probably the people you saw. Silberman-Bibas is the distraught mom with two redheaded kids clutched to her chest. Yaffa Adar is the white-haired woman being taken to Gaza by golf cart."
Kids Need Dirt and Danger,2021-06-16,TheAtlantic,['Matti Friedman'],"When you passthe kindergarten at Sde Eliyahu, a kibbutz near the Jordan River in northern Israel, you might not recognize it. Instead, you’ll see a yard for castaway objects: rusty tractor parts, old computers, and orphaned bike wheels. It takes a few moments to realize that some person, or many people, has devoted thought to arranging the parts into strange structures and machines.What seems at first like a haphazard jumble in the yard at this kibbutz, and in hundreds of similar yards across Israel, is in fact the expression of a theory about how children should learn and a sharp critique of the way they’re usually taught. The kindergarten junkyard is countercultural at a moment preoccupied with safety and litigation—but may have something to teach parents who’ve just been through a yearlong education on the limits of education itself. The junkyard is one answer to a pressing question: When we teach kids, should we prepare them to climb an orderly ladder of tests that lead to other tests, grades, and degrees—or should we prepare them for chaos?I found Malka Haas at Sde Eliyahu in the spring, in a knitted winter hat and sweater, sitting in a wheelchair pushed by her son, Elisha. She recently turned 100, has been blind for several years, and is now too frail to walk or be interviewed. But she was a dominant figure in the Israeli world of early-childhood education well into her 90s. My wife is from this kibbutz, a product of the kindergarten junkyard, and she—like everyone else who grew up here—speaks of Haas with great reverence and a little fear. Haas was never a teacher of the bubbly variety. She’s a tough woman who learned some tough lessons, and came up with tough ideas."
Poland Shows That Autocracy Is Not Inevitable,2023-10-16,TheAtlantic,['Anne Applebaum'],"Thirty-four years ago, in June 1989, Poland woke up to a surprise. Despite a voting process rigged to favor the Communist Party, despite decades of propaganda supporting Communists and smearing anti-Communists, despite the regime’s control of the army, the police, and the secret police, the democratic opposition won, taking all of the seats that it was allowed to contest. A team of former dissidents took control of the government two months later—the first non-Communist government in Soviet-occupied Europe. In the decade that followed, Poland slowly decentralized the state and built a democracy.This morning, Poland woke up to a similar surprise. Since first winning power democratically in 2015, the nationalist-conservative party Law and Justice, or PiS, has turned state television into a propaganda tube, used state companies to fund its political campaigns, and politicized state administration. In the run-up to this election, italtered electoral lawsand evenleaked top-secret military documents, manipulating their contents for electoral gain. Even so, the party appears to have won only just over a third of the vote. Three opposition parties will likely have a parliamentary majority. Barring unexpected surprises, and perhaps some attempts to block their victory, they will form a center-right/center-left coalition. Once again, Poles will have to slowly decentralize the state and rebuild their democracy."
The Patron Saint of Inner Lives,2016-03-14,TheAtlantic,['Adam Kirsch'],"G“reat geniuses havethe shortest biographies,” Emerson wrote. “Their cousins can tell you nothing about them. They lived in their writings, and so their house and street life was trivial and commonplace.” This may not always be true—there is, after all, a genius of action as well as a genius of contemplation—but for poets in particular, it is a good rule of thumb. As Keats put it, “A poet is the most unpoetical of anything in existence.” The recipe for poetry involves taking an ounce of experience and subjecting it to a lifetime of distillation; think of the cosmos Emily Dickinson spun out of no more life than would fit in an upstairs bedroom. It is a mistake to think that a person becomes a poet because she undergoes exceptional experiences—because she lives more wildly, intensely, or colorfully than other people. The poet doesn’t feel unique emotions any more than the painter sees unique colors; it is what she does with ordinary emotions that turns them into poetry.For the modernist poets who revolutionized American literature in the early 20th century, impersonality was a kind of mania—and a sign of how seriously they took their artistic project. The 1910s and ’20s were the palmy days of Greenwich Village, an era of free love and radical politics. But the greatest poets of that era, the ones who actually created modernism, kept this kind of bohemian playacting at arm’s length. Indeed, for most of the modernists, the more revolutionary their poetics, the more carefully they concealed themselves behind the manners and professions of the bourgeoisie. T. S. Eliot was a banker when he wrote “The Waste Land”; William Carlos Williams was a family doctor; Marianne Moore, an editor, was a devout churchgoer who lived with her mother."

The Masterpiece No One Wanted to Save,2023-02-09,TheAtlantic,['George Packer'],"“There is nopossible way of responding to Belsen and Buchenwald,” Lionel Trilling wrote in 1948. “The activity of mind fails before the incommunicability of man’s suffering.” The crimes of both the Nazi and Soviet regimes in the 1930s and ’40s defied all precedents of analysis and feeling. No ism could account for them; no wisdom could make them bearable. Though inside the stream of history, they seemed to belong to a realm of occult, pure evil. Today we’re drowning in art and scholarship about Europe’s terrible 20th century, but for contemporaries of the events, there was no language.This silence—fear, shame, denial, simple inarticulateness—was broken soon after the war by the emergence of a new prose genre: the literature of witness. If the crimes could not be comprehended, they could at least be told—by victims and survivors, in subjective first-person voices, all the more authoritative for their lack of rhetorical flourishes and theological frames: Primo Levi’sSurvival in Auschwitzand its sequel,The Reawakening; Anne Frank’s diary; Elie Wiesel’sNight; Charlotte Delbo’s trilogy,Auschwitz and After; Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’sTheGulag Archipelago; and, in the 1990s,I Will Bear Witness, the Dresden diaries of the German Jewish scholar Victor Klemperer. These and a few other books now comprise a European canon of the worst that human beings have done and suffered.ThatBabi Yar, by the Russian Ukrainian writer Anatoly Kuznetsov, never joined the list is a strange omission with a story of its own. The book’s subject, the Nazi occupation of Kyiv, and its literary qualities makeBabi Yarevery bit the peer of the canonical works of witness. Its fraught journey to publication half a century ago, and now to a reissue (with an introduction by Masha Gessen) amid the Russian assault on Ukraine, only adds to its power as enduring testimony. The book’s very typography carries the scars of its struggle to tell the truth."
"From This Hill, You Can See the Next Intifada",2023-02-06,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"It’s a little after 8 p.m. on a frigid hill in the West Bank village of Beita, and Sa’ed Hamayyel is sitting in front of a crackling outdoor fire, his face framed by smoke, telling me how his son was killed. “He was 16 years old,” the Palestinian father says. “He was a student.” On June 11, 2021, Israeli soldiers “shot him from afar … He couldn’t have posed any threat to them.”Hamayyel is intimately familiar with the violence and loss that pervades this part of the world. Decades ago, his father, brother, and sister were all killed in combat with Israeli forces. Along with them, Hamayyel isclaimedas a member by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an internationally designated terrorist groupresponsiblefor numerous attacks on civilians. But when his son Mohammed was killed, the teenager was not engaged in armed conflict. He was protesting an Israeli outpost called Evyatar, which overlooks Beita.Although few Israelis could pinpoint Evyatar on a map, and although its existence is illegal under Israel’s own law, this tiny settlement is set to play a large role in the new Israeli government’s plans and the future of Israel and the West Bank. The reason for this is math.The country’s new governing coalition is composed of six parties that together received just48.4 percentof the vote. But rather than moderate the coalition’s ambitions, the fragility of this arrangement hasempoweredits most extreme elements, because they have become essential to the government’s continued existence. Just as U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy must now rely on the backing of radicals such as Marjorie Taylor Greene to maintain his perilous perch atop a narrow Republican majority, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depends on his coalition’s far-right flank to maintain his precarious position atop Israeli politics."
There Is No Right to Bully and Harass,2023-12-06,TheAtlantic,['David Frum'],"Yesterday, the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, and MIT were caught in a trap in front of a House committee. Each wasaskedwhether calling for the genocide of Jews violated rules at their university. Each president refused to answer directly, insisting that everything depends on context.So here’s the context: On university campuses and in many other places, anti-Semitic speech regularly crosses the line into threats, intimidation, and outright violence against Jews. University rules and local laws are intentionally violated because everybody knows that the rules and laws are selectively enforced.Liberals in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson and John Stuart Mill like to compare speech and debate to a marketplace. Let all offer their ideas in peaceful competition; let all have equal opportunity to listen and judge. But there’s another tradition consolidating around us. In this tradition, speech is not like a market. It’s like a battle. The goal is not to enlighten, but to dominate. Adversaries must be overawed, intimidated, and silenced."

The Danger Ahead,2023-12-04,TheAtlantic,['David Frum'],"For all itsmarvelous creativity, the human imagination often fails when turned to the future. It is blunted, perhaps, by a craving for the familiar. We all appreciate that the past includes many moments of severe instability, crisis, even radical revolutionary upheaval. We know that such things happened years or decades or centuries ago. We cannot believe they might happen tomorrow.When Donald Trump is the subject, imagination falters further. Trump operates so far outside the normal bounds of human behavior—never mind normal political behavior—that it is difficult to accept what he may actually do, even when he declares his intentions openly. What’s more, we have experienced one Trump presidency already. We can take false comfort from that previous experience: We’ve lived through it once. American democracy survived. Maybe the danger is less than feared?In his first term, Trump’s corruption and brutality were mitigated by his ignorance and laziness. In a second, Trump would arrive with a much better understanding of the system’s vulnerabilities, more willing enablers in tow, and a much more focused agenda of retaliation against his adversaries and impunity for himself. When people wonder what another Trump term might hold, their minds underestimate the chaos that would lie ahead.By Election Day 2024, Donald Trump will be in the thick of multiple criminal trials. It’s not impossible that he may already have been convicted in at least one of them. If he wins the election, Trump will commit the first crime of his second term at noon on Inauguration Day: His oath to defend the Constitution of the United States will be a perjury.A second Trump term would instantly plunge the country into a constitutional crisis more terrible than anything seen since the Civil War. Even in the turmoil of the 1960s, even during the Great Depression, the country had a functional government with the president as its head. But the government cannot function with an indicted or convicted criminal as its head. The president would be an outlaw, or on his way to becoming an outlaw. For his own survival, he would have to destroy the rule of law."

How Lebanon Transformed Anthony Bourdain,2018-06-09,TheAtlantic,['Kim Ghattas'],"If you are having thoughts of suicide, please know that you are not alone. If you are in danger of acting on suicidal thoughts, call 911. For support and resources, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text 741-741 for the Crisis Text Line.Growing up in Beirut during Lebanon’s 15–year civil war, I wished for someone like Anthony Bourdain to tell the story of my country: a place ripped apart by violence, yes, but also a country where people still drove through militia checkpoints just to gather for big Sunday family lunches, or dodged sniper fire to get to their favorite butcher across town to sample some fresh, raw liver for breakfast. Bourdain, the legendary roving chef and master storyteller who committed suicide on Friday in France at the age of 61, would have approved of such excursions in search of the perfect morsel—he probably would have come along.Coming of age during conflict made me want to become a journalist. I hoped to tell the story of my country and the Middle East—a place rife with conflicts, sure, but also layered with complexities, a place of diverse peoples full of humanity. In the summer of 2006, I was the BBC’s Beirut correspondent when war erupted between Israel and Hezbollah, the pro-Iran Shia militant group. Hezbollah had kidnapped three Israeli soldiers, triggering the month-long conflict. Within a day, the Israelis had bombed Beirut’s airport out of action. I worked 34 days in a row, 20 hours a day, reporting live on television and radio, alongside dozens of colleagues who’d flown in to help cover the conflict."
This Debacle Will Transform Israel,2023-10-09,TheAtlantic,['Eliot A. Cohen'],"The history of the Israel Defense Forces is a history of failure followed by exceptionally rapid recovery. Israel’s elite paratrooper units were born from organizations created after a series of botched retaliation raids in the early 1950s. Its armored corps became one of the world’s best after a dismal performance in 1956. Other units were created after a failed attempt in 1974 to rescue hostages held in the town of Ma’alot. Israel’s brilliant suppression of Syrian air defenses in 1982 resulted from staggering aircraft losses in 1973’s Yom Kippur War, and so on.Each time, after failure, the IDF adapts, as it will today. It is helped in doing so by a tradition of brutal self-scrutiny. Almost all of the documentation of the Agranat Commission after the 1973 war has been declassified; eventually that of the Winograd Commission, which delved into the failures of the 2006 Lebanon War, will be as well. In each case, heads rolled—ministers of defense, chiefs of staff, and even prime ministers. Following the current debacle on the Gaza border, the same is likely to occur. What hundreds of thousands of Israeli protesters alarmed by a proposed judicial reform could not do to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, five or six grim-faced retired judges, generals, and civil servants probably will."
Four Misconceptions About the War in Gaza,2023-10-18,TheAtlantic,['Andrew Exum'],"The past week in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been horrific, and the next few weeks promise only more misery and pain.Every shooting war is also a war between competing narratives—each side has its preferred way of framing the conflict—and few have been as fiercely contested in this regard as the war between Israel and the Palestinians. A week in, we should pause to interrogate some of what we have heard combatants and pundits say.In the aftermath of the attacks on Israel, which included atrocities such as the murder of children and the elderly, Israel and its defenders have likened Hamas to the Islamic State, the violent Islamist movement that briefly took over large swaths of Iraq and Syria before its defeat by local forces."
What Exactly Is Saudi Arabia's Relationship to Terrorism?,2016-09-30,TheAtlantic,"['Daniel Byman, The Brookings Institution']","Congress’soverride of President Obama’s vetoto allow Americans to sue Saudi Arabia for links to the 9/11 plot raises many questions, not the least of which concern the relationship between Saudi Arabia and terrorist groups today. As Itestified earlier this year, Saudi Arabia has made considerable progress on counterterrorism in the last 15 years, but still has a long way to go.Before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and really until al-Qaeda began to attack the kingdom directly in May 2003, Saudi Arabia was often uncooperative on counterterrorism, and more part of the problem than part of the solution. Since 2003, the Saudi regime has emerged as a vital counterterrorism partner, and several important successes against al-Qaeda in particular are due in large part to its cooperation. Yet it’s not a simple story of progress: The kingdom engages in many troubling behaviors today that make the terrorism problem worse. In the end, policymakers would do well to remember that Saudi Arabia is a key partner but not a friend: The United States and Saudi Arabia share many common interests, but they do not share common values or a common worldview.What's the link, exactly?Understanding Saudi Arabia’s relationship with terrorists, however, is far more difficult than assessingIran’s open, extensive sponsorship of terrorism. Much of Saudi support is done by non-state actors. Yet that does not absolve the Saudi government of responsibility. These non-state actors enjoy a range of relationships with the Saudi regime. Some receive or did receive official patronage. Others, particularly those tied to leading clerics in the kingdom, are embraced indirectly by the regime’s self-proclaimed role as defender of the faithful. And still others are truly private, acting independently of the government and in times in opposition to it."
Nikki Haley Offers an Alternate Reality,2023-11-06,TheAtlantic,['Elaine Godfrey'],"For some Republican voters, to attend a Nikki Haley campaign rally is to dive headfirst into the warm waters of an alternate reality—a reality in which Donald J. Trump is very old news.Last Thursday, this comfortable refuge could be found at the Poor Boy’s Diner in Londonderry, New Hampshire, where a few dozen white retirees wedged into booths adorned with vintage license plates and travel posters suggesting a visit to sunny Waikiki. The crowd, mostly Republican and “undeclared” voters wearing sundry combinations of flannel and cable-knit, clapped along as Haley—a youthful 51-year-old—outlined her presidential priorities: securing the border, supporting veterans, promoting small business, and “removing thekick mesign from America’s back.” Haley’s voice was steady; her words were studied; and the attendees beamed from their tables as though they couldn’t believe their luck:Finally, their relieved smiles seemed to say, here was a conservative candidate who didn’t sound completely unhinged.The voters I met had had it up to here with the former president, they told me: the insults, the drama, the interminable parade of indictments and gag orders. They’ve been yearning for a standard-issue Republican with governing experience and foreign-policy chops, and Haley, the former accountant turned South Carolina governor turned ambassador to the United Nations fits their bill and then some. When Haley finished speaking, voters scrambled to secure a campaign button readingNH ♥ NH. Some of them waited in line for half an hour to shake her hand."

What Hamas Wants,2023-10-16,TheAtlantic,['Yair Rosenberg'],"“Did Israel Avert a Hamas Massacre?” That was the question posed by the headline ofaVanity Fairexposépublished in October 2014. The investigative report laid out a sophisticated plot by the Islamist terror group to kill and kidnap Israelis on the Gaza border. The plan: to use underground tunnels to infiltrate nearby civilian enclaves on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, when the communities would be at their most vulnerable. As one intelligence source put it, the operation had two goals: “First, get in and massacre people in a village. Pull off something they could show on television. Second, the ability to kidnap soldiers and civilians using the tunnels would give them a great bargaining chip.” The Israel Defense Forces subsequentlyconfirmedthis reporting to other media outlets, but not the specific date.The tunnels were real. But at the time the massacre-that-wasn’t received little additional media coverage. It seemed too cinematic and convenient. Maybe it was a Hamas pipe dream that was never operational. Or maybe it was a worst-case scenario concocted by the Israeli security services and leaked to the media to justify their own ever-expanding countermeasures. Years passed without a mass border incursion, the tunnels were gradually detected and blocked, and I came to the conclusion that the skeptics were right about the plot being too lurid even for Hamas."
The Iranian Hedgehog vs. the American Fox,2019-06-21,TheAtlantic,['Karim Sadjadpour'],"Though few citizens of the United States or Iran seek conflict, the two countries are on a dangerous trajectory that has less and less to do with the diverging interest of two nation-states. More and more, the escalation is being driven by theclashing temperamentsof two cynical elderly men. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the 80-year-old Iranian supreme leader, has been steadfast, even monomaniacal, in opposing the United States. In contrast, the 73-year-old Donald Trump has employed a flurry of strategies—from flattering Iran to coming within minutes of military strikes—to bring Tehran to heel.The Oxford University philosopher Isaiah Berlin’sseminal 1953 essay, “The Hedgehog and the Fox,”offers a simple dichotomy to explain recent dynamics between the United States and Iran—or, rather, between Trump and Khamenei.Borrowing a line from the ancient Greek poet Archilochus, Berlin divided human beings into two different categories: “The fox knows many things,” he wrote, “but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” Hedgehogs have a grand theory of the world, while foxes employ a different cunning for every circumstance. He cites Shakespeare and Aristotle as examples of foxes, while “Karl Marx was the most implacable hedgehog of them all.”"
Stop Alleging Anti-Semitism Just to Score Political Points,2019-02-15,TheAtlantic,['Jeremy Ben-Ami'],"There’s little doubt that Israel is shaping up to be one of the hottest of hot-button issues in the 2020 presidential-election cycle. While one might hope that a presidential campaign could feature a productive discussion about policy toward a region vital to U.S. interests, what we’re likely to have instead is a toxic political firefight, rife with partisan attacks and recrimination, bereft of insight or vision.Republicans are already attacking critics of Israeli government policy as “anti-Israel,” or even “anti-Semitic.” They have set out to drive a wedge between the progressive and more centrist wings of the Democratic Party, focusing in particular on people of color, women, and, most cynically, the two newly elected Muslim women in Congress.The first order of business in the Republican-controlled Senate was taking up legislation to suppress the free-speech rights of pro-Palestinian activists and extend U.S. legal protection to Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.When many senators—including almost every declared Democratic 2020 presidential candidate in the chamber—objected to the legislation on First Amendment grounds, Republicans such as Senator Marco Rubio accused them of secretly supporting the problematic Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which does not recognize the right of the Jewish people to a state."
Jerusalem’s Ramadan Is Different This Year,2018-05-18,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"JERUSALEM—It’s holiday season here in the Holy Land. Parts of the Old City are decked out for Ramadan in paper lanterns of yellow, red, and green. On the first Friday of the holiday, the often quiet streets of the Muslim Quarter were packed. Tiny boys screamed the price of sweets to hungry passersby, many of whom are fasting from sunrise to sunset every day this month. Palestinians from all over Israel and the Palestinian territories pile into buses and cars and travel here forjummah, the weekly communal prayers, at Al-Aqsa Mosque, the holy site where Muslims believe Muhammad prayed. “We can enter Al-Aqsa just on Friday, just in this holy month in Ramadan. In other months, we can’t enter here,” said Fatima Bader, a 19-year-old Muslim woman who was headed into the mosque with her mom and a couple of other women. “So it’s really emotional.”The mundane ins and outs of permits and politics pervade life for Palestinians here, but especially so as Ramadan begins this week. On Monday, the U.S.embassy opened in Jerusalem. On Tuesday, Palestinians observed what they call Nakba Day—nakbais the Arabic word for “catastrophe”—commemorating the Arab defeat in the 1948 warto prevent the formation of the Jewish state, and the subsequent displacement of Palestinians from their villages and land. Throughout all of this,violence raged in Gaza, as protesters massed along the border fence with Israel. As some protesters rushed the barrier, Israeli forces released tear gas and fired on those who approached, fearing a massive breach. Hamas, the militant group–cum–political party that runs Gaza, organized the so-called March of Return with the goal that Palestinians would be able to reclaim their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. The grouplater claimedthat 50 of the 62 Gazans who were killed during the riots on Monday and Tuesday were their members, although that claim is nearly impossible to verify, and the group may have been purposefully overstating its influence.As the Gaza protests wind down, at least for now, and the television crews pack up, this will be the story that continues: a daily existence of permits and politics, of special sweets and prayerful seasons, with constant reminders of the underlying tensions that blew up this week but will soon settle back into an uneasy status quo before blowing up again.While the cloudy arcs of tear gas and towering plumes of smoke from burning tires in Gaza captivated the Western media, the quieter story—of what it’s been like this week for other Palestinians, who haven’t been part of massive, chaotic protests—is just as important."
The War in Gaza Is Getting Remixed in Real Time,2023-10-21,TheAtlantic,['Kaitlyn Tiffany'],"In any war, onlookers from far outside the conflict zone have to decide what to believe about what is happening. This sounds difficult in theory, and it’s even more so in practice.This week, after adeadly explosionat the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, anybody checking social media for news would have immediately seen conflicting stories about what had happened. Initial news reportscitedGaza’s health ministry in asserting that the blast had come from an Israeli air strike. Almost instantly, counter-stories blaming the Palestinians went viral. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden said that data from the U.S. Defense Department had convinced him that the blast wascausedby a malfunctioning Islamic Jihad rocket, and some open-source intelligence researcherscautiously agreedwith that version of events. More detailed analyses are still pending, but a broader meaning of the hospital story has already been well established: It is “misformation”oneway oranother, circulated cynically to slanderIsraelorPalestine, depending on your worldview.Some facts about the war are, of course, clear. In Hamas’sattack on Israelon October 7, terrorists killed some 1,400 people and took about 200 hostages. They then hijacked hostages’ social-media accounts to livestream their confinement and taunt their friends and family, producing images that shocked and horrified the world. Gaza health officials say that in the past two weeks,more than 3,500 Palestinians, including hundreds of children, have been killed by Israeli air strikes."
How to Make Sense of Russia’s War on Ukraine Right Now,2022-04-01,TheAtlantic,[''],"Putin wants democracy to fail, not only in Ukraine but across the West too,Anne Applebaum writes. “He wants to put so much strain on Western and democratic institutions, especially the European Union and NATO, that they break up. He wants to keep dictators in power wherever he can, in Syria, Venezuela, and Iran. He wants to undermine America, to shrink American influence, to remove the power of the democracy rhetoric that so many people in his part of the world still associate with America. He wants America itself to fail.”Not likely, but itmight be practice, writes Tom Nichols.

Israel’s Dangerous Delusion,2023-11-01,TheAtlantic,['Hussein Ibish'],"This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read fromThe Atlantic, Monday through Friday.Sign up for it here.Israel has launched what appears to be the first phase of a massive ground incursion into Gaza, vowing that Hamas must be eliminated or somehow rendered irrelevant, even at the expense of smashing Gaza to pieces.But what then? Israeli officials have reportedly told the Biden administration that they haven’t engaged in any serious postconflict planning. That’s probably because none of their options is good and, despite a plethora of fantastical proposals, nobody is going to step in to bear the burden of Israel’s impossible dilemma or, put more simply, clean up its mess.Israelis may feel that it doesn’t have any responsibility for realities in Gaza, given that Hamas has controlled the territory since 2007. But the rest of the world understands that the occupation has continued, albeit from beyond the borders of the Strip. Israel has all the while kept tight control over Gaza’s coastal waters, its airspace, its airwaves, and all of the crossings into the Strip except for a small one maintained by Egypt. Israel has made almost all of the major decisions regarding Gaza since 1967—including the reckless and self-destructive decision to bolster Hamas in order to split the Palestinian national movement between Islamists based in Gaza and secular nationalists in the West Bank."
Stop Demonizing Stock Buybacks,2023-02-27,TheAtlantic,['James Surowiecki'],"President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address earlier this monthfeatureda hefty dose of good old-fashioned economic populism. Biden called out the rich for cheating on taxes, and big companies for not paying any taxes at all. He attacked Big Pharma for jacking up drug prices. And he took aim at one of progressives’ bêtes noires: stock buybacks.Biden attacked companies for spending money on buybacks rather than investing in their operations, and called on Congress to quadruple the tax on such stock repurchases—a tax first put in place by last year’s Inflation Reduction Act. And on February 14, Senate Democrats Sherrod Brown and Ron Wydenintroduceda bill that would do exactly that.The proposed tax would raise some revenue, and make more similar the taxation treatment of buybacks and dividends. But that’s not really the point of the tax. Its goal is to discourage corporations from doing something that many Democrats now see as useless at best and downright harmful at worst.Buybacks, according to their critics, are a form of stock-market manipulation designed purely to make corporate executives rich. Such self-dealing, critics say, is responsible for wage stagnation, corporate underinvestment, and sluggish economic growth. When Southwest Airlines’ scheduling softwarecrashed recently, leading to a flood of cancellations, buybackswere citedas one of the culprits. And after the Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, buybackswere again blamed—in this case, for the company stinting on safety upgrades. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer captured the prevailing sentiment last August, when hecalledbuybacks “despicable.”"
A Message From Iran,2023-10-08,TheAtlantic,['Kim Ghattas'],"The Hamas attack against Israel is not only a massive Israeli intelligence and military (as well as a U.S. intelligence) failure, but also a dramatic success for Iran’s axis of resistance from Yemen to Gaza. The highly choreographed, multipronged, day-long operation and incursion into Israel itself, involving the use of motorized paragliders and drones and the taking of hostages, required months of planning and training that only Iran and Hezbollah could have provided. Late yesterday, a Hamas spokespersontoldthe BBC that Iranian support for the assault was a point of pride.In Tehran yesterday, members of Parliament chanted, “Death toIsrael.” The Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh made a televised speechwarningArab countries that Israel could not protect them—an apparent threat against countries that had signed the Abraham Accords, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which has been considering normalizing ties with Israel. Mohammed Deif, the commander of Hamas’s armed wing, said that his group’s action would at last put an end to Israeli air raids against Iranian and Hezbollah assets in Syria."
The Word ‘Genocide’ Has An Actual Meaning,2023-11-15,TheAtlantic,['Noah Feldman'],"The present Gaza war,initiated by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, poses important questions about both the morality and laws of war and the language of conflict. People everywhere are having heated conversations involving concepts such as targeting civilians, terrorism, proportionality, and genocide. They deploy these concepts when arguing about broad questions, like whether Hamas’s attacks on civilians are justified resistance, and about narrower ones, like whether a specific Israeli bombing of a refugee camp is justified to kill Hamas leaders and destroy underground tunnels.To a trained international lawyer, these terms have concrete definitions. At the same time, the terms are also moral concepts, and most people who aren’t trained lawyers use them colloquially rather than legally. The trouble is that the general rhetorical meanings of many of the words don’t match the legal meaning. That leads to the confusion of people talking (or yelling) past one another. It also obscures the primary moral message that underlies the law of armed conflict."

Trump’s New Attempt to Push Palestinians to Negotiate With Israel,2018-09-10,TheAtlantic,['Krishnadev Calamur'],"The Trump administrationannouncedMonday the closure of the Palestine Liberation Organization office, which serves as the de facto Palestinian Embassy, in Washington. It was the latest in a series of punitive measures the administration says is designed to force the Palestinians to return to negotiations with Israel. And the announcement from the U.S. State Department came the same day that John Bolton, the national-security adviser, railed against the International Criminal Court for going after Israel and the United States, declaring the international judicial body “dead to us.”What it added up to was another effort to turn up the pressure on Palestinians, who a Palestinian diplomat said are “immune” to it, in the context of the administration’s broader skepticism of international institutions and their role in the world.“We have permitted the PLO office to conduct operations that support the objective of achieving a lasting, comprehensive peace between Israelis and the Palestinians since the expiration of a previous waiver in November 2017,” Heather Nauert, the U.S. State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. “However, the PLO has not taken steps to advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.”"
 America Keeps Accidentally Helping Iran,2018-05-09,TheAtlantic,['Dominic Tierney'],"For decades, since the Iranian Revolution, the United States has engaged in a quasi-war with Tehran. Washington backed Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq War, described Iran as being part of an “axis of evil” alongside Iraq and North Korea, launched the Stuxnet cyberattack on Iranian nuclear facilities in 2009, and provided weapons for Saudi Arabia to fight a proxy war against Iran in Yemen. Today, the United States and Iran still lack formal diplomatic relations. President Donald TrumpdescribedIran as “the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism,” with a “sinister vision of the future.” Meanwhile, Iranian propaganda pushes a narrative of resistance against the United States—the “great Satan”—as well as Israel.It’s striking, then, that since 9/11, major U.S. foreign-policy gambits in the Middle East have consistently aided Iranian interests. America is not so much Iran’sfrenemyas itsfremesis: a supposedly mortal adversary that unintentionally gives critical support. By scrapping the Iran nuclear deal, Trump is following an established U.S. playbook of helping Tehran.America’s puzzling tendency to further Iranian interests began in 2001 with the removal of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. Of course, Washington’s goal was not to help Iran, but instead to fight al-Qaeda and its state sponsors. Nevertheless, the effect of the intervention was to topple one of Iran’s major opponents. At the time, Iran backed rebel groups fighting the Taliban, and almost launched a full-scale war against the Islamist group in 1998 following the killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan. Today, as Washington looks to exit Afghanistan, Tehran hasperformeda diplomatic pirouette by providing backing to the Taliban, in order to speed up the American departure and maximize Iranian influence."

The Decolonization Narrative Is Dangerous and False,2023-10-27,TheAtlantic,['Simon Sebag Montefiore'],"Peace in the Israel-Palestine conflicthad already been difficult to achieve before Hamas’s barbarous October 7 attack and Israel’s military response. Now it seems almost impossible, but its essence is clearer than ever: Ultimately, a negotiation to establish a safe Israel beside a safe Palestinian state.Whatever the enormous complexities and challenges of bringing about this future, one truth should be obvious among decent people: killing 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200, including scores of civilians, was deeply wrong. The Hamas attack resembled a medieval Mongol raid for slaughter and human trophies—except it was recorded in real time and published to social media. Yet since October 7, Western academics, students, artists, and activists have denied, excused, or even celebrated the murders by a terrorist sect that proclaims an anti-Jewish genocidal program. Some of this is happening out in the open, some behind the masks of humanitarianism and justice, and some in code, most famously “from the river to the sea,” a chilling phrase that implicitly endorses the killing or deportation of the 9 million Israelis. It seems odd that one has to say: Killing civilians, old people, even babies, is always wrong. But today say it one must.How can educated people justify such callousness and embrace such inhumanity? All sorts of things are at play here, but much of the justification for killing civilians is based on a fashionable ideology, “decolonization,” which, taken at face value, rules out the negotiation of two states—the only real solution to this century of conflict—and is as dangerous as it is false.Ialways wonderedabout the leftist intellectuals who supported Stalin, and those aristocratic sympathizers and peace activists who excused Hitler. Today’s Hamas apologists and atrocity-deniers, with their robotic denunciations of “settler-colonialism,” belong to the same tradition but worse: They have abundant evidence of the slaughter of old people, teenagers, and children, but unlike those fools of the 1930s, who slowly came around to the truth, they have not changed their views an iota. The lack of decency and respect for human life is astonishing: Almost instantly after the Hamas attack, a legion of people emerged who downplayed the slaughter, or denied actual atrocities had even happened, as if Hamas had just carried out a traditional military operation against soldiers. October 7 deniers, like Holocaust deniers, exist in an especially dark place.The decolonization narrative has dehumanized Israelis to the extent that otherwise rational people excuse, deny, or support barbarity. It holds that Israel is an “imperialist-colonialist” force, that Israelis are “settler-colonialists,” and that Palestinians have a right to eliminate their oppressors. (On October 7, we all learned what that meant.) It casts Israelis as “white” or “white-adjacent” and Palestinians as “people of color.”"
An Unusually Tricky Campus Free-Speech Fight,2023-11-09,TheAtlantic,['Conor Friedersdorf'],"Late last month, the chancellor of Florida’s university system, acting in consultation with Governor Ron DeSantis, ordered state universitiesto deactivate all local chaptersof Students for Justice in Palestine.How could dissolving student groups be lawful, given constitutional protections for free speech and freedom of association? Although multiple local SJP chaptersacted as apologistsfor the murders of Israeli civilians or stood in solidarity with the Hamas militants who killed and kidnapped children, even viewpoints that deplorable are entitled to First Amendment protection.But Florida says it is not targeting the protected speech of these groups. It is acting, instead, because the national SJP has run afoul of a state law against providing “material support” to a terrorist organization. Many people associate such laws with providing money, weapons, a safe house, or fake passports to terrorists. But material-support statutes can also render speech and advocacy that would otherwise be protected by the First Amendment unlawful. For example, Americans are free to post “Hurray for Hamas!” on social media. Yet an American could not coordinate with Hamas to draft and post “Hurray for Hamas!” as part of a marketing strategy."
The War in Ukraine Is Just Beginning,2022-03-12,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"If conflicts in places such as Ethiopia, Palestine, Kashmir, Syria, and Yemen have proved anything, it’s that wars are easy to start, but are also brutal, intractable, and difficult to end. The fickle nature of the international media means that protracted conflicts quickly lose the world’s attention, if they ever had it to begin with.At the moment,Russia’s invasion of Ukrainehas riveted the world, drawing more attention than the ongoing slaughters in other nations—adouble standardthat has been widely noted. But that gap in coverage is likely to become even more striking the longer the conflict continues, because the factors that make a long war in Ukraine seemingly inevitable are the same ones that make it unlikely to slip from the world’s collective radar.In some ways, Ukraine was already in the midst of a long-running crisis. The country has been engaged in armed conflict with Russia since Moscow’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, which even before Russia’s invasion last month had resulted in the deaths of more than14,000 people, many of them civilians. That the war has now escalated beyond the two countries’ de facto border has raised the stakes of the conflict, threatening both Ukraine’s sovereignty and that of its neighbors, many of which are nowjustifiably askingwhether they could be next."
Israel’s Problems Are Not Like America’s,2021-05-24,TheAtlantic,['Matti Friedman'],"RereadingExodus, theschmaltzy 1958 best seller about Israel that became a Hollywood movie starring Paul Newman, I was surprised by something I hadn’t noticed as a teenager. The author, Leon Uris, describes a utopia of brave young pioneers in khaki shorts, farming when possible and fighting when necessary, quoting Bible verses as they hook up in ancient ruins, and so forth. But the novel isn’t just a fantasy about Israel, as I’d remembered, or even primarily that: It’s about America.Exodussays less about the country where it’s set than about an American tendency, one very much in evidence this month, to imagine people here in Israel as a reflection of themselves.“She was one of those great American traditions like Mom’s apple pie, hot dogs, and the Brooklyn Dodgers” is how Uris describes his main female character, Kitty Fremont, a nurse who isn’t Jewish but finds herself embroiled in Israel’s War of Independence. The male lead, Ari Ben Canaan, is a blond frontiersman, tough yet sensitive, who knows his way around good cognac, the foxtrot, and an automatic rifle. He’s a Jew worthy of the great American tradition embodied by Kitty, andExodusends with them together. That seems, in fact, like the point of the book."
We Can't Predict Whether Trump Will Succeed in the Middle East,2017-05-25,TheAtlantic,['Hussein Ibish'],"President Trump’s visit to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories was long on rhetoric and optics but short on substance, particularly regarding the peace process. Trump is clearly determined to prioritize the Israeli-Palestinian issue and link it with broader regional concerns. But it’s impossible to judge whether we are headed in the right direction or charging headlong down the same old dead end. That’s because at this stage, a great start that ultimately produces tangible results and a false start that produces quixotic flailing at best or real harm at worst would both look much the same—and much like what we’ve been seeing.On the positive side, Trump has salvaged the Israeli-Palestinian issue from the diplomatic dumpster of recent years. He’s owning the project, designating his son-in-law and chief adviser, Jared Kushner, as the nominal point-person, and his longtime attorney, Jason Greenblatt, as negotiator. Because this is now a White House undertaking closely associated with his own reputation, when the time comes, he might well be willing to leverage his personal and institutional credibility to pressure parties. That can’t be overestimated. Barack Obama’s second term shows what can happen when an American president walks away."

AIPAC Is Losing Control of the Narrative on Israel,2019-03-26,TheAtlantic,['Emma Green'],"It was the final day of AIPAC’s annual policy conference in Washington, D.C., and the star of the gathering had finally appeared: Benjamin Netanyahu. An estimated 18,000 attendees sat in rows in a large downtown convention center, watching the Israeli prime minister address them through a patchy satellite feed on gigantic blue screens; although Netanyahu met with President Donald Trump in Washington this week, he cut short his trip after rockets fired from Gaza struck a home outside Tel Aviv.It was difficult to hear what Netanyahu was saying at times, but the audience didn’t care: The staunch Israel supporters who filled the room gave him standing ovations. The only other speaker who won nearly as much applause on Tuesday morning was David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel. He brought greetings from Trump, “Israel’s greatest ally ever to reside in the White House,” as Friedman put it. The whole event underscored the enthusiastic Trump-Netanyahu alliance, even by the standard of the traditionally strong U.S.-Israel relationship. In his meeting with Trump at the White House on Monday, Netanyahu compared him to Cyrus the Great, the Persian king, and Harry Truman, the U.S. president who recognized Israel.Anxiety was a consistent theme throughout the conference: American and Israeli leaders condemned rising anti-Semitism and consistently took shots at Representative Ilhan Omar, the freshman Democrat from Minnesota whocaused an uproarover her use of anti-Semitic tropes and criticisms of Israel. Many speakers wrung their hands over the way Israel is allegedly becoming a so-called wedge issue in American politics, lamenting partisan divisions over support for the Jewish state."
Religious Bias Is Distorting American Foreign Policy,2017-12-13,TheAtlantic,['Kori Schake'],"Among the many odd elements of President Donald Trump’s announcement that the U.S. Embassy in Israel will move to Jerusalem is that it comes precipitously in advance of Vice President Mike Pence’s trip to region. The purpose of the trip was toshow solidaritywith the plight of Christians in the Middle East, yet Christian leaders—including the Coptic Pope—are refusing to meet with Pence. What those leaders understand, which the Trump administration seems not to, is that Christians in the Middle East have lived and will continue to live in societies where Muslim majorities determine political and social outcomes, and those outcomes become less tolerant when religious minorities are perceived to be the exclusive beneficiaries of U.S. policy.In October, speaking at an annual solidarity dinner for the advocacy organization In Defense of Christians, Pencecommittedthe Trump administration to “work hand in hand from this day forward with faith-based groups and private [organizations] to help those who are persecuted for their faith.” This was wonderful news. Faith-based organizations are some of the best and most active means by which Americans reach out into the world."
"A Record of Pure, Predatory Sadism",2023-10-23,TheAtlantic,['Graeme Wood'],"This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read fromThe Atlantic, Monday through Friday.Sign up for it here.This afternoon, at a military base north of Tel Aviv, the Israel Defense Forces held a grisly matinee screening of 43 minutes of raw footage from Hamas’s October 7 attack. Members of the press were invited, but cameras were not allowed. Hamas had the opposite policy on cameras during the attack, which it documented gleefully with its fighters’ body cams and mobile phones. Some of the clips had been circulating already on social media in truncated or expurgated form, with the footage decorously stopped just before beheadings and moments of death. After having seen them both in raw and trimmed forms, I can endorse the decision to trim those clips. I certainly hope I never see any of the extra footage again.It was, as IDF Major General Mickey Edelstein told the press afterward, “a very sad movie.” Men, women, and children are shot, blown up, hunted, tortured, burned, and generally murdered in any horrible manner you could predict, and some that you might not. The terrorists surround a Thai man they have shot in the gut, then bicker about what to do next. (About 30,000 Thais live in Israel, many of them farmworkers.) “Give me a knife!” one Hamas terrorist shouts. Instead he finds a garden hoe, and he swings at the man’s throat, taking thwack after thwack.The audience gasped. I heard someone heave a little at another scene, this one showing a father and his young sons, surprised in their pajamas. A terrorist throws a grenade into their hiding place, and the father is killed. The boys are covered in blood, and one appears to have lost an eye. They go to their kitchen and cry for their mother. One of the boys howls, “Why am I alive?” and “Daddy, Daddy.” One says, “I think we are going to die.” The terrorist who killed their father comes in, and while they weep, he raids their fridge. “Water, water,” he says. The spokesman was unable to say whether the children survived.The videos show pure, predatory sadism; no effort to spare those who pose no threat; and an eagerness to kill nearly matched by eagerness to disfigure the bodies of the victims. In several clips, the Hamas killers fire shots into the heads of people who are already dead. They count corpses, taking their time, and then shoot them again. Some of the clips I had not previously seen simply show the victims in a state of terror as they wait to be murdered, or covered with bits of their friends and loved ones as they are loaded into trucks and brought to Gaza as hostages. There was no footage of rape, although there was footage of young women huddling in fear and then being executed in a leisurely manner.Edelstein said that the IDF chose to show the footage out of necessity. It is not every day that snuff films of Jews are shown at an IDF screening hall. (The original site of the screening was a commercial theater, which would have been even worse.) “What we shared with you,” Edelstein said, searching for words, “you should know it.” And he said he struggled to understand how some journalists could present the IDF and Hamas as comparable. This footage would refute that false equivalence.“We are not looking for kids to kill them,” he said. “We have to share it with you so no one will have an idea that someone is equal to another.”To me the most disturbing section was not visual at all. Like the clip of the father and his boys hunted in their pajamas, it was upsetting in part because it showed a relationship between parent and child. The clip is just a phone call—placed by a terrorist to his family back in Gaza. He tells his father that he is calling from a Jewish woman’s phone. (The phone recorded the call.) He tells his father that his son is now a “hero” and that “I killed 10 Jews with my own hands.” And he tells his family, about a dozen times, that they should open up WhatsApp on his phone, because he has sent photographs to prove what he has done. “Put on Mom!” he says. “Your son is a hero!”His parents, I noticed, are not nearly as enthusiastic as he is. I believe that the mom says “praise be to God” at one point, which could be gratitude for her son’s crimes or pure reflex, indicating her loss for words to match her son’s unspeakable acts. They do not question what their son has done; they do not scold him. They tell him to come back to Gaza. They fear for his safety. He says, amid rounds of “Allahu akbar,” that he intends “victory or martyrdom”—which the parents must understand means that he will never come home. From their muted replies I wonder whether they also understand that even if he did come home, he would do so as a disgusting and degraded creature, and that it might be better for him not to.A ground invasion of Gaza seems almost certain.

Trump Isn’t Merely Unhinged,2023-11-13,TheAtlantic,['David A. Graham'],"With apologies to acertain newspaper’s slogan, many of Donald Trump’s most dangerous statements hide in the plain light of day.The problem is not that they don’t get reported on—they do—but even so, they are easy to tune out, perhaps because he’s been saying outlandish things for so long that people simply can’t bring themselves to parse the new ones; or perhaps because they’ve become accustomed, or at least numb, to his utterances; or perhaps because they don’t want to let him occupy their headspace; or perhaps because he got kicked off Twitter (now X) and they had no interest in joining Truth Social. Or maybe it’s because the more sinister material gets mixed up with his strange elocutions (“We’re gonna have a great country—it’s gonna be called the United States of America”), contrarian hot takes (“You know, Hezbollah is very smart. They’re all very smart”), and gibberish (“All of these indictments that you see—I was never indicted. Practically never heard the word. It wasn’t a word that registered”).Whatever the case may be, Trump has continued to make plainly dangerous and stunning remarks. Notwithstanding his rival Governor Ron DeSantis’srecent claimthat Trump has “lost the zip on his fastball,” the former president continues to produce substantive ideas—which is not to say they are wise or prudent, but they are certainly more than gibberish. In fact, much of what Trump is discussing is un-American, not merely in the sense of being antithetical to some imagined national set of mores, but in that his ideas contravene basic principles of the Constitution or other bedrock bases of American government."
Watching Israeli TV’s Fauda as a Palestinian,2018-06-08,TheAtlantic,['Yasmeen Serhan'],"It’s the third week of Ramadan, a month of fasting, charity, and prayer for the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims. In the Arab world, it’s also a month for an influx of new TV specials, which families gather to watch after breaking their fast. Because I’ve spent most of my Ramadans outside the Arab world—often without access to the region’s popular TV channels—I’ve never been able to enjoy these shows the way my family members in the region might. Which show I watch depends on whatever Netflix has on offer at the time. My last couple of Ramadans have involved reruns ofThe OfficeandFrasier.But this year, one week into Ramadan, I noticed the release of the second season of the Israeli political thrillerFauda(the word means “chaos” in Arabic). The show follows an undercover unit of the Israeli army called the Mista’aravim. Arabic-speaking soldiers pose as Palestinian civilians to apprehend suspected terrorists in the West Bank. First broadcast in Israel in 2015, the show gained international acclaim when it made its Netflix debut a year later."
Iran’s Leaders Have a Problem They Can’t Fix,2020-01-19,TheAtlantic,['Suzanne Maloney'],"When Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers at Tehran’s Grand Mosque for the first time in eight years on Friday, Iran’s supreme leader described the downing of Ukrainian Airlines Fight 752 by his military as a “bitter accident”—one that enemies abroad were exploiting as an excuse to discredit the Islamic Republic. But the real threat to the regime, which has spent decades trying to cement its rule, is the discontent of the Iranian public. Both the plane crash on January 8 and the cover-up that followed struck at the heart of the grievances that shape Iranians’ anger toward and alienation from their government. And if the demise of Flight 752 revealed the government’s malign disregard for its own citizens, its relentless suppression of the subsequent protests has only underscored its imperviousness to any meaningful accountability.After decades of international sanctions that hamper Iran’s ability to buy new aircraft and spare parts, the country’s plane fleet is notoriously old andprone to catastrophe—so much so that the early reports citing engine problems sounded plausible to people grimly inured to aviation risks. But the early explanations for the downing of Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 quickly crumbled under the weight of obvious falsehoods. In reality, Flight 752 had been downed by Iran’s own air defenses. In the course of retaliating against the United States for the drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani, Iranian military commanders apparently mistook the jetliner for an incoming American cruise missile. But this tragedy never would have occurred had Tehran taken the obvious precaution of halting civilian air traffic as it began missile strikes against U.S. forces in Iraq. Iranian leaders declined to take this step. Citing unnamed sources, the London-based Persian-language news channel Iran International, which is frequently critical of the Iranian government,reportedthat officials believed the presence of civilian aircraft in the skies would deter any possible U.S. counterattacks."
"Shimon Peres, 1923-2016",2016-09-28,TheAtlantic,"['Krishnadev Calamur, Matt Ford']","Shimon Peres, an enduring figure of Israeli life and politics who in more than six decades in politics served as both prime minister and president of the Jewish state and, along the way, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace, has died. He was 93, and had been hospitalizedsince suffering a strokeon September 14.“Shimon devoted his life to our people and the pursuit of peace,”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “He set his gaze on the future. He did so much to protect our people.”Born Shimon Persky in what was then Poland, in 1923, Peres immigrated with his family in 1932 to what was then Palestine. Those members of his family who remained behind, including his grandfather, who had urged him to “Be a Jew, forever,” were killed in the Holocaust. During Israel’s war of independence, Peres was put in charge of weapons purchases and military recruitment by David Ben-Gurion, who would later become prime minister. In 1953, when he was 30, Peres was running the Ministry of Defense, where he laid the groundwork for Israel’s nuclear program and is widely regarded as its father."
The Coming Storm in Israel,2018-05-11,TheAtlantic,['Neri Zilber'],"TEL AVIV—While predictions of doom in Israeli-Palestinian relations tend to come easy, the worst doesn’t always come to pass. But thanks to a pair of major upcoming anniversaries, the vagaries of the Jewish and Muslim calendars, and the whimsy of President Donald Trump, the coming week could be different. The confluence of numerous events set to take place over a few days in May has felt, as it approaches, like a perfect storm gathering.In truth it has already begun, encouraged by a decision made far away in Washington, when President Trump on Tuesday withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement. That night Israeli jets struck inside Syria against what Israel said were Iranian militiamen preparing to launch rockets against Israel. The following evening, Iranian proxies under the command of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fired a barrage of rockets against Israeli positions on the Golan Heights, an Israeli-controlled sliver of land on the Syrian frontier, drawing a massive Israeli retaliation strike against over 50 Iranian targets.It was a new spike in the steadily increasing directclashesthat have taken place in recent months between Israel and Iran in Syria. In an effort to stop Tehran from establishing a permanent military foothold in the country, Israel had already struck at least three Iranian bases inside Syria since February, reportedly killing over 20 Iranian military officers. Given, too, the public reveal last week of a daring Mossad operation deep in the heart of Tehran, it seemed that an Iranianresponsewas just a matter of time—although, according to Israeli security officials, not before Trump’s deadline to withdraw from or keep the Iran deal (originally set for May 12). The thinking was that the Iranians wouldn’t want to provide apretextfor a U.S. withdrawal from the deal. Developments over the last few days have vindicated this assessment. Still, neither Israel nor Iran seem all that inclined to back down, and further confrontations are likely."
Quit Harping on U.S. Aid to Israel,2019-03-29,TheAtlantic,['James Kirchick'],"Some 18,000 people descended on the Walter E. Washington Convention Center this week in the nation’s capital for the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. One of the country’s most influential lobbies, AIPAC has long been the subject of avid (and conspiratorial) condemnation by those who dislike the role it plays in sustaining bipartisan support for the Jewish state. In recent weeks, the famously press-shy organization unwittingly became the subject of a fiercenational debate over anti-Semitismafter Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar suggested that American elected officials support the Jewish state because they are paid to do so.Contrary to popular belief (an impression abetted by its confusing acronym), AIPAC does not donate money directly to candidates; it is not a political-action committee. What AIPAC does do, like any interest group, is encourage its politically active membership to back candidates who pledge support for its agenda. Foremost among the group’s policy priorities is upholding the annual U.S. military-aid package to Israel, which—at $3.8 billion a year—constitutes the largest direct American military subvention to any single country. And it is this subvention that critics most frequently cite to justify singling out Israel for opprobrium."
The Question the Iran Hawks Haven’t Answered,2019-06-24,TheAtlantic,['Peter Beinart'],"Since September 11, 2001, the United States has waged wars to unseat the rulers of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, wreaking chaos and destruction in the process. The consequences—for American power and prestige, for the American troops killed and wounded, and for the people whose countries disintegrated into civil war—have been catastrophic. Given this dismal track record, one might think no policy maker, politician, or pundit would advocate attacking yet another government in the greater Middle East without answering a simple question: What happens after the bombing starts?Most of the commentary advocating war with Iran fails this test.Start with National Security Adviser John Bolton, the Trump administration’s most influential proponent of war. Last September, Boltonwarnedthe Iranian regime, “If you cross us, our allies, or our partners, if you harm our citizens, if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay … we will come after you.”We will come after you… and then what? What if—after America comes after Iran—Iran comes after America? Bolton doesn’t say."
