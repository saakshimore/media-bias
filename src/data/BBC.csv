What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?,2023-12-07,BBC,,"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.
The Israeli military responded with air strikes on Gaza, and launched a ground offensive. More than 16,200 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run government.
Fighting has resumed after a seven-day temporary truce, during which Hamas released more than 100 hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinians who were held in Israeli jails.
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warplanes have been carrying out strikes across Gaza while its troops move through the territory.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has a ""clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities"", as well as freeing the hostages.
He also declared that Israel would have ""overall security responsibility"" for the Gaza Strip ""for an indefinite period"" after the conflict. Israel later said it has no plans to reoccupy the territory.
Israel has drafted 300,000 reservists for the operation, to boost its standing force of 160,000.
The IDF says it has struck thousands of targets belonging to Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation.
It also says it has destroyed hundreds of tunnel shafts built underneath Gaza. Hamas has claimed that its tunnel network stretches for 500km (310 miles).
A number of hospitals in the north were caught up in intense fighting.
Since the temporary ceasefire ended, Israeli troops have pushed into southern Gaza, and have taken ""aggressive"" action against Hamas and other armed groups in and around the city of Khan Younis.
There has also been sustained fighting around the Jabalia refugee camp and Shejaiya in the north, where hundreds of thousands of civilians remain.
Israel claims to have killed thousands of Hamas fighters during the war, including many commanders.
The IDF says 411 of its soldiers have been killed since 7 October, the vast majority in the attacks that day by Hamas.
During the 7 October attacks, Hamas tookabout 240 hostages- who, it said, were hidden in ""safe places and tunnels"" within Gaza.
Israel said more than 30 of the hostages were children, and that at least 10 were aged over 60. It also said about half of the hostages had foreign passports from 25 different countries.
Under a deal brokered by Qatar, a pause in the fighting began on 24 November.
During the seven-day truce, which ended on 1 December, 105 hostages were freed, in return for 240 Palestinians who had been held in Israeli jails.
The hostages included:
Hamas released four Israeli hostages before the truce agreement was made, and another wasfreed by Israeli forces.
Israel says 138 people are still in captivity, but ""there is no possibility right now of bringing everyone home,"" according to Mr Netanyahu.
Hamas has said other armed groups in Gaza are holding hostages, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which could complicate any future releases.
UN secretary general Antonio Guterres has urged the UN Security Council to push for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, warning that the humanitarian system may collapse, and public order could completely break down.
More than 16,200 people have been killed and more than 36,000 have been injured since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run government. It says three quarters of the wounded are children and women.
Mr Netanyahu has admitted that Israel has been""not successful""in minimising civilian casualties, but insisted this is because Hamas uses Gaza's population as human shields.
Few of Gaza's hospitals are still operational due to damage caused by attacks and the lack of electricity and fuel.
Some 800,000 residents in northern Gaza are without any access to health services, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Without fuel, water pumps and desalination plants, waste and sanitation services, and bakeries have been unable to function.
Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said that 1.9 million Gaza's residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced and that1.1 million of them have been sheltering in its facilities.
This includes the hundreds of thousands of people who fled the fighting in the north after an Israeli ultimatum to move south of a river known as Wadi Gaza for their own safety.
Unrwa saidthe 600,000 people in southern Gazawho have been ordered to leave their neighbourhoodshave nowhere to go, as shelters are already beyond capacity.
Israel's military published an online map with Gaza split into more than 600 blocks, showing areas where people should evacuate for their own safety.
But the BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen said the map is complicated, contains conflicting information, and requires a smartphone for access.
Unicef, the UN charity for children, warned that some of the ""safe"" zones are ""tiny patches of barren land"" with no water, sanitation or shelter.
After the 7 October attack, Israel shut its border crossings with Gaza, preventing the usual supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine from entering the territory.
The heads of major UN agencies saidcutting off essential supplies to 2.2 million Palestinians was an ""outrage"", and UN secretary general António Guterres repeatedly called for a sustained ceasefire on humanitarian grounds.
Israel obstructed all fuel deliveries until late November, arguing it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes.
Almost 1,400 lorry loads of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza via Egypt's Rafah border crossing between 21 October and 21 November, compared with a monthly average of 10,000 before the war.
During the seven-day pause in fighting, hundreds of lorries carrying aid and fuel crossed at Rafah, which is the only functioning passage in and out of Gaza. But it has been very difficult to get goods into the north.
The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said it managed to help about 250,000 people during the truce, but the resumption of fighting had made the distribution of aid ""almost impossible"".
According to Unrwa, humanitarian assistance has been ""reduced virtually to nothing"", raising fears of widespread hunger and disease amongst the population.
Hundreds of foreign passport holders - including some British and US citizens - and seriously wounded and sick Palestinians have also been allowed to leave, but many remain. The Rafah crossing remains tightly controlled by Egypt.
On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, breaking through the heavily guarded perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders.
It wasthe most serious cross-border attack against Israel in more than a generation.
The gunmen killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.
The BBC has also seen and heardevidence of rape, sexual violence and mutilation of women during the Hamas attacks, Victims included children, teenagers and pensioners.
The attack came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions: 2023 has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Hamas is a Palestinian group which has run Gaza since 2007.
The name is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means Islamic Resistance Movement.
The group wants to destroy Israel and replace it with an Islamic state.
Its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, is thought to have about 30,000 members.
Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, firing thousands of rockets into Israel and carrying out other deadly attacks.
In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes, sending in troops in 2008 and 2014.
Hamas - or in some cases the al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU and the UK, as well as other powers.
Iran backs the group, providing funding, weapons and training.
The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.
Previously occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israelduring the 1967 Six-Day War.
Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.
Home to2.2 million people, the narrow strip is one of the most densely-populated areas in the world.
Just over three-quarters of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN.
Before the latest conflict, more than 500,000 people lived in eight refugee camps located across the Strip.
Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and strictly limits the movement of people and goods.
The West Bank and Gaza are known as the Palestinian territories. Along with East Jerusalem and Israel, they formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.
In 1948, part of Palestine became Israel, which was recognised by the United Nations the following year. The West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Gaza are recognised as Palestine by many countries and bodies, although it does not have member status at the UN.
Those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist also still refer to all of the land as Palestine.
The Palestinian president isMahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation.
He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party - a bitter rival of Hamas.

Gaza: Children screamed in street as we fled 2am air strike,,BBC,By Rushdi Abu Alouf,"Gaza's only power plant has run out of fuel, and medical and food supplies are dwindling, after another night which saw hundreds scramble onto the streets to flee relentless air strikes.
At 02:00 on Wednesday, a neighbour banged on my door and told me to leave now as my flat was being targeted.
Air strikes from Israeli warplanes have continued into their fifth day.
The situation for 2.3 million people in Gaza is increasingly desperate, with no way of leaving the tiny territory.
The only power station in Gaza stopped operating completely on Wednesday at 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), authorities say.
Israel cut essential supplies, including fuel, to the sealed-off territory on Monday following a violent incursion by Hamas militants.
The lack of mains power means residents of Gaza have to rely on generators for electricity. But there is no way to import fuel for generators either.
There is now little hope of leaving the territory, after Israeli crossings were shut and Egypt was forced to close its only crossing point with Gaza due to nearby air strikes.
I tried to get my family out, because it is unclear what might happen here in the future - but that was impossible.
In the early hours of Tuesday morning, I woke up my three children, we grabbed our emergency kit and headed to the hospital.
But when we got there, hundreds of people were blocking the entrance - they too were looking for a place to shelter overnight.
Half-asleep children screamed as they stumbled through the streets with rockets flying overhead.
On Wednesday morning, Hamas said 30 people were killed in overnight strikes. In total, more than 1,000 Gazans have died in the retaliatory air strikes.
Israel's military said they had hit 450 targets in the Gaza strip in the past 24 hours.
The air strikes began after Hamas militants crossed into Israel and launched a wave of attacks on communities across the south of the country, killing at least 1,200 Israelis. An estimated 150 people have been taken hostage by Hamas.
Israel declared a ""complete siege"" on Gaza on Monday, declaring electricity, food, fuel and water would be cut off. The impacts of that siege can now be seen.
On Tuesday, I met a woman in a supermarket scouring the shelves looking for milk for her baby. She only had half a bottle left, but the supermarket was bare.
About 80% of people in Gaza relied on humanitarian aid even before the latest war began - and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said atleast a million people had not been able to get their food rations since Saturday.
The World Health Organisation has called for a humanitarian corridor to be opened into the territory. But here, civilians don't hold out hope that will happen.
A leading British-Palestinian doctor, Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, told the BBC the health system in Gaza would collapse within a week unless aid was allowed.
""All of the beds are full. Patients who need surgery are unable to go into surgery because the operating rooms are operating at maximum capacity,"" he said, adding that this was the bloodiest assault he had seen since he started working in Gaza over 40 years ago.
""Because people are being injured in their homes, around 30-40% of the injuries are children. Whole families are being brought in wounded... In war you try to discharge cases early so you can free up beds, but these patients are all coming from houses that have been destroyed and so you cannot send them back to the street,"" he said.
Hamas's leader said he would not negotiate prisoner swaps for food and medicine, and he would not negotiate with Israel while the territory was under fire.
The UN human rights chief has said sieges are illegal under international law. UN agencies have also condemned the mass killings by Hamas and called on them to release the hostages they have taken.
And while Israel insists it is not targeting the civilian population in Gaza, the people here feel a decision to cut water, food, medical and electrical supplies to 2.3 million people is a collective punishment.
People in Gaza know what war looks like, but this one feels different.

Israel's military says it fully controls communities on Gaza border,,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israel's military says troops are in full control of all communities along the border with Gaza, two days after Hamas's unprecedented assault.
Fighting between troops and Palestinian militants in several areas on Monday morning had become ""isolated"", a spokesman told reporters. But he warned that militants might still be at large.
At least 700 people in Israel are reported to have been killed.
Another 560 people have been killed in Gaza in retaliatory Israeli strikes.
A Hamas spokesman claimed that four Israelis taken hostage during Saturday's attack were among those killed in the latest strikes, but there was no independent confirmation.
Israel's defence minister meanwhile ordered a ""complete siege"" of Gaza.
The two million Palestinians in the Hamas-ruled territory are also bracing themselves for a possible ground operation, with Israeli forces massing nearby.
At the start of Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there were seven or eight areas in southern Israel where troops were still fighting gunmen.
The included Be'eri, a kibbutz that was infiltrated by about 70 militants overnight, possibly using a cross-border tunnel, it added.
A tunnel exit was also reportedly found near Kfar Aza, another kibbutz where a family was being held hostage.
But a few hours later, the IDF's chief spokesman, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, declared that security forces had regained control of border communities and killed a number of militants.
""We are now carrying out searches in all of the communities and clearing the area,"" he said, adding that ""it is possible there are still terrorists"".
Adm Hagari said the IDF planned to secure breaches in the Gaza perimeter fence with tanks and aircraft and that it had mobilised a record 300,000 reservists.
He also said that about 4,400 rockets had been fired from Gaza towards Israel since Saturday morning, when hundreds of Hamas militants used them as cover to infiltrate Israel.
Not long after the briefing, rocket sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as fresh barrages were launched. Several people were reportedly injured in the southern cities of Ashkelon and Ashdod.
For Israelis collectively traumatised by the assault from Gaza, the scale of the number of casualties continues to shock.
Israel's health ministry has not confirmed how many people have been killed, but Israeli TV channels report that the death toll exceeds 700. Almost 2,400 people have been wounded.
The BBC has learnt that ""more than 10"" British citizens are feared dead or missing in Israel, according to an official UK source.
A volunteer group called Zaka, which helps to recover human remains, said more than 250 bodies had been taken from the scene of an all-night rave party and that more were still to be recovered.
The IDF is also focused on rescuing the dozens of Israeli soldiers and civilians, including women and children, being held as hostages by Hamas in Gaza.
""The hostages and their possible locations are being taken into account as we decide what our next step is. Israel is a state that holds human life sacred and we will do everything in our power to ensure that they're coming back home safe,"" spokeswoman Masha Michelson told the BBC.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked mayors of border towns to ""stand steadfast because we are going to change the Middle East"".
""What Hamas will experience will be difficult and terrible,"" he said. ""We are already in the campaign and we are just getting started.""
Israeli warplanes, helicopters and artillery struck more than 500 targets in Gaza overnight that the IDF said belonged to Hamas and the smaller militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
They included eight command centres, several multi-storey buildings, including the home of senior Hamas official Ruhi Mashtaa, and three ""terror tunnels"", it added.
At least 560 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and 2,900 injured since Israel began its retaliatory strikes, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
On Monday, health officials said at least 15 people were killed in an attack in the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp, north of Gaza City.
Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif claimed that Israel was ""still in a state of shock, losing its mind, and committing crimes against humanity by targeting and killing dozens of innocent civilians"".
The United Nations said more than 123,000 people had been displaced in Gaza, mostly because of fear or the destruction of their homes. The majority are seeking shelter in schools.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, meanwhile, said he had ""ordered a full siege on the Gaza Strip. No power, no food, no gas, everything is closed.""
""We are fighting human animals and we act accordingly,"" he declared.
Israel's infrastructure minister later said the water supply would also be cut.
Palestinian officials warned that Gaza would run out of fuel, food and medicine within 24 to 72 hours. Its power station and water and sewerage systems would have to shut down without fuel.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli-Egyptian blockade since the Hamas takeover 16 years ago. The two countries say it is for security reasons.
Tensions are also running high in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinian health officials say 16 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces since Saturday.
Also on Monday, the IDF said its soldiers had killed a number of armed suspects who had crossed the frontier from Lebanon into Israeli territory.
Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed it was behind the attack and that seven Israeli soldiers were injured.
It comes a day after Lebanon's Hezbollah movement fired rockets at Israeli positions in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area and Israeli forces responded with artillery fire and a drone strike.

Israel-Gaza war: Hamas hostage's family not expecting release,,BBC,,"The family of Irish-Israeli girl Emily Hand do not expect her to be among the first group of Israeli hostages to be released by Hamas.
Emily Hand’s Dublin-born father Tom was initially informed that his daughter was among a group of people killed in an attack on a kibbutz on 7 October.
Israel began attacking Gaza after Hamas fighters crossed the border on 7 October, killing 1,200 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostages.

Israel Gaza: How missiles and destruction quickly returned after ceasefire,,BBC,,"A temporary pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas has ended, resulting in missile strikes and destruction once again.
The two sides have blamed each other for the returning violence. Israel said that Hamas violated the ceasefire by failing to release women and children who are being held hostage in Gaza. Hamas said that Israel was responsible as it prevented fuel supplies from reaching the north of Gaza.
The BBC's Anna Foster reports from southern Israel, near the border with Gaza, and the BBC's Middle East correspondent Hugo Bachega reports from Jerusalem.

Israel-Gaza: Palestinian family left homeless after strikes,,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"Kamal Nabhan was screaming as he thrust the phone into his cousin's hands, unable to believe what the anonymous caller was telling him.
The men had just got ready to go to afternoon prayers in Jabalia refugee camp. But the routine patterns of life were about to give way to violent destruction, wrought from above with a warning call.
Kamal's cousin Ataf reached out to his relative.
""I took the phone from him and talked to the person on the line,"" says Ataf. ""He said he was from Israeli intelligence, and you have five minutes to evacuate the house.""
They began to rush back, telling the Israeli caller he must be mistaken because the building ""was full"" of disabled people. ""[The intelligence officer] said: 'No, immediately evacuate the house,'"" says Ataf.
It was day five of the fiercest Israeli air strikes on Gaza in nine months. The campaign of so-called targeted assassinations killed at least six leading figures in Islamic Jihad, the Palestinian territory's second most powerful militant organisation.
But the attacks also killed 10 civilians on the first night alone - including wives and children of some of the men targeted as they slept. The group retaliated with waves of rocket attacks on Israeli cities, forcing tens of thousands to take cover in bomb shelters.
Israel said it was acting after repeated rounds of rocket fire by Islamic Jihad, which in turn said it had fired because of police raids against Palestinians at al-Aqsa mosque in occupied east Jerusalem, and the recent death in Israeli jail of hunger striker Khader Adnan.
Last week's fighting killed 33 Palestinians in Gaza and two people in Israel - an Israeli and a Palestinian. It left more than 1,200 Palestinians displaced, according to the UN.
At the Nabhan family's building, Israel delivered on its warning. A single missile blew the block apart.
Just before a ceasefire deal was agreed late on Saturday, Israel destroyed several other residential blocks in similar circumstances - giving warnings to evacuate residents before bombing the buildings. These strikes that bring down whole apartment blocks are a well-worn tactic in its attacks on Gaza.
Israel says the buildings it hit were used as ""command and control centres"" by Islamic Jihad to direct rocket launches. It said its warning calls were meant to prevent harm to uninvolved civilians.
Local sources believe a militant lived in the building but not that it was an operational centre. Human rights groups condemn such attacks destroying entire residential blocks as a violation of international law. Another resident who received a warning call was filmed pleading with Israeli forces to limit any attack ""to the apartment of the guilty"".
The building in Jabalia has collapsed into its own foundations. An entire staircase that provided the escape route for several families lies horizontally, jutting into a smashed wall section. The remains of the roof are a few metres above the earth, providing the only shade for the former residents. Neighbours managed to get everyone out - nearly 50 people from eight families.
There were five people in the building with disabilities including muscular dystrophy, say support groups. Some had wheelchairs, specially modified beds and medicines destroyed in the air strike, they add.
Jamal al-Rozzi, executive director of the Gaza-based Society for Rehabilitation, who came to help the families, says his group will provide aid including food and medical devices.
""I feel angry and I feel pain because this should not happen, at least not for the civilians, especially not disabled people,"" he says.
Also sheltering among the rubble is another of Kamal Nabhan's relatives. Rahma Nabhan and her husband Yasser are sitting under a fractured roof slab, passing their baby daughter Jori to each other to soothe her cries.
""My sisters-in-law are disabled - they were not able even to cover their heads [when they were rescued], their wheelchairs were buried under the house,"" says Rahma.
""Everyone saw the disabled people fleeing. They were asking: 'Why did the house have to be destroyed? Have these disabled people fired rockets?' We have nothing to do with what's going on,"" she says.
Rahma walks me around the remnants, still clutching Jori as we navigate the rubble.
Her flat was on the top floor. Now there are only cardboard signs the residents have hoisted over the concrete remains, showing the names of each former inhabitant.
""We are not going anywhere, we will stay in the sun, sleep in the sun, we are not leaving the house,"" says Rahma.
""We call on the international organisations and [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas] to stand with us and rebuild this house because we have no place to go,"" she says.
The ceasefire reached on Saturday night, mediated by Egypt, has largely held. But tensions remain extremely high, after months of spiralling violence in the occupied West Bank which has spilt over into Gaza on three major occasions since an all-out war between Israel and Hamas in May 2021.
Last week's attacks have left Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu politically emboldened. They could easily have ignited a far bigger confrontation - in fact they still could despite the truce. But he has used the fighting to burnish his reputation for security in the face of unprecedented domestic unrest and growing pressure from religious-ultranationalist extremists in his coalition.
Despite its losses, Islamic Jihad has used the escalation to promote its appeal as the current face of armed resistance against Israel while Hamas - the dominant militant group in Gaza - stayed on the sidelines in terms of military action.
It publicly backed the rocket fire as part of a ""unified"" position by Palestinian factions but effectively restrained itself, thereby limiting the round of fighting. It also has to keep services running for Gaza's population under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade. A larger war could swing popular opinion further against it.
Since 2021, the Israeli government has given permits to thousands of workers to cross into Israel, boosting Gaza's economy and bolstering tax revenues for Hamas. However, the group has warned against annual plans for an ultranationalist Israeli flag march through Muslim areas of occupied east Jerusalem on Thursday, keeping tensions boiling.
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are listed by Israel and the West as terrorist organisations.
However, many Palestinians here feel abandoned by an international community that still talks about a political future for the region - a two-state solution - which is outright rejected by both Israel's nationalist government and the Palestinian armed groups.
At the Nabhans' house, neighbours and other Gaza-based charities arrive for a gathering in solidarity with the residents. It comes on the same day Palestinians mark the 75th anniversary of the Nakba, when 700,000 people fled or were forced from their homes in the conflicts surrounding Israel's creation.
The homeless residents hold up signs saying ""Protect us"" and ""We call for help"".
Ataf Nabhan, who took the warning call from the Israeli intelligence officer, gestures to the rubble and tells me his plea is simple.
""This family needs a shelter,"" he says. ""We just ask the human rights organisations - take care of this family.""

London mayor meets multi-faith leaders as hate crimes rise,2023-10-20,BBC,By Yasmin Rufo,"The mayor of London has held a roundtable meeting with Jewish and Muslim faith leaders following a rise in hate crimes in the capital.
Mr Khan hosted the Community Security Trust (CST) and Tell MAMA to discuss measures to keep Londoners safe.
It comes after Met Police figures showed ahuge increase in both antisemitic and Islamophobic attacksduring October.
The mayor said it was ""important to come together to stop hate crimes"".
He added that police would ""take a zero tolerance approach"".
Speaking to the BBC after the event, Iman Atta, director of Tell MAMA, an organisation that supports victims of anti-Muslim attacks, said Palestinian Muslim families had ""reported graffiti on their door stating killer, terrorist and murder, and Nazi symbols"".
She added that other Muslim women have ""had death threats on the London Underground where a woman gestured to them that she will cut their heads"".
Jonny Newton, director of communications at CST, a group that helps to protect the Jewish community, said they were all ""feeling very vulnerable at this time"".
He said the attacks had ""dredged up inter-generational trauma and pain"".
According to Scotland Yard there were 218 antisemitic incidents across London between 1 and 18 October, up from 15 during the same period last year.
The number of Islamophobic incidents also rose to 101, from 42 in the same time period.
So far, 21 people have been arrested and officers have been working through 1,400 reports of potentially illegal content online.
Jewish organisation Campaign Against Antisemitism has questioned the Met's handling of protests in the capital.
It said the force had stopped the group from displaying images of Israeli children kidnapped by Hamas on van billboard screens in Parliament Square on Wednesday due to a pro-Palestinian vigil taking place nearby.
The organisation also accused police of ""physically restraining"" its chief executive Gideon Falter.
The Met said it had ""no wish to limit freedom of expression"", but had a ""responsibility for public safety"" and therefore ""officers were keen to avoid the billboard vans becoming a point of tension or conflict"".
""There will be occasions where we try to avoid groups with strongly opposing views coming into immediate contact with each other,"" it added.
""We took similar actions on Saturday where we prevented pro-Palestinian demonstrators from reaching the area around the Israeli Embassy given their doing so would likely have led to an escalation in tension and a possible risk to public safety.""
Meanwhile, three Labour councillors in London have resigned over the party leadership's stance on what is happening in the Middle East.
On Wednesday Kensington councillor Mona Ahmed and Hounslow councillor Lara Parizotto resigned.
Ms Ahmed said she ""condemned the killing of innocent civilians"" and ""expected the same"" from her party.
On Thursday, another councillor, Lotte Collett, who represents a ward in Haringey, resigned having said it was ""shocking"" that Sir Keir Starmer and his leadership team were not calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and accused it of failing to ""condemn Israeli aggression as mounting breaches of international law are occurring"".
In an interview onLBC radiolast week, Sir Keir was asked whether cutting off water and power supplies into Gaza would be appropriate as part of an Israeli response, to which he replied: ""I think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation.
""Obviously, everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself.""
Pro-Palestinian demonstrations took place outside the party's HQ on Friday morning, with people chanting ""Labour Party shame on you"" and ""no more money for Israel's crimes"".

March reaches Jerusalem calling for release of Israeli hostages,,BBC,By Oliver Slow,"Thousands of Israelis have joined the families of hostages held in Gaza to call on the government to prioritise securing their release.
Protesters walked from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem before holding a demonstration outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence.
He has been criticised for not doing more to free those held by Hamas.
It comes as US President Joe Biden reiterated calls for a two-state solution.
Of the estimated 240 people taken hostage by Hamas during their deadly 7 October attacks, only four have been freed so far and another, a soldier, was rescued in an Israeli operation.
This week Israel's military said it had found the bodies of two hostages -65-year-old Yehudit Weissand 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the Gaza Strip.
The protest calling for the hostages' release started in Tel Aviv on Tuesday before heading to Jerusalem. Near the end of their march protesters stopped briefly to release hundreds of yellow helium balloons.
""We want answers,"" said Ari Levi, who had two family members - including his 12-year-old son - taken by Hamas from kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October.
""It's not normal to have children kidnapped for 43 days. We don't know what the government is doing, we don't have any information,"" Mr Levi told the AFP news agency.
""I want the government to bring them home to us,"" said Dvora Cohen, 43, whose brother-in-law and 12-year-old nephew are both believed to be held by Hamas.
In a press conference on Saturday night Mr Netanyahu said that ""until now there has not been a hostage release deal"", adding that ""when we have something to say, we will update you"".
He said that the first goal of the war is to destroy Hamas, the second is to return the hostages and the third is to eliminate the threat from Gaza.
On Saturday, about 400 people protested in Caesarea, north of Tel Aviv, calling on Mr Netanyahu to resign, according to local media reports.
One sign read: ""He who blames only the army does not deserve to command it.""
Last month Mr Netanyahu swiftly deleted a social media post blaming military and security chiefs for allowing the Hamas attacks to take place. He later apologised.
Separately, in anarticle published in the Washington Poston Saturday, Mr Biden said the two-state solution is ""the only way to ensure the long-term security of both the Israeli and Palestinian people"".
The president was referring to a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent state of Palestine living peacefully alongside Israel.
""A two-state solution - two peoples living side-by-side with equal measures of freedom, opportunity and dignity - is where the road to peace must lead,"" Mr Biden wrote, adding that achieving it would require ""commitments from Israelis and Palestinians"".
The article - which also accused Hamas of having an ""ideology of destruction"" - appeared to be aimed at Mr Netanyahu, who has opposed the two-state solution throughout his political career.
His survival as prime minister depends in part on support from Israeli hardliners who believe the entire territory between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea was given to the Jewish people by God.
Mr Netanyahu has previously said that Israel must maintain ""overall military responsibility"" in Gaza ""for the foreseeable future"".
Mr Biden also said the Palestinian Authority should govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank after the Israel-Hamas war, adding that his government is prepared to issue visa bans against ""extremists"" attacking civilians in the occupied West Bank.

Jabalia: Israel air strike reportedly kills dozens at Gaza refugee camp,2023-10-31,BBC,By David Gritten,"An Israeli air strike is reported to have killed dozens of people at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 50 people were killed and 150 wounded. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead.
Pictures showed several large craters, surrounded by shattered buildings.
The Israeli military said the strike killed a senior Hamas commander and ""underground terror infrastructure"" beneath buildings collapsed afterwards.
It added that a ""large number of terrorists"" from Hamas's Central Jabalia Battalion who had been with the commander at the time were also killed.
Israeli tanks and troops, meanwhile, continued to advance towards some of northern Gaza's most populated areas, including Jabalia.
Israel has said it is the ""second phase"" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage.
Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.
Tuesday's air strike in Jabalia caused a huge explosion that destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the refugee camp, where before the war 116,000 people were living in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).
Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was ""an earthquake"".
""I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,"" he told AFP news agency.
Video footage and photos showed hundreds of people searching the wreckage afterwards. ""We're filling bags with children,"" cried one man, holding up a small white cloth bag covered in blood.
AFP reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.
A long line of body bags were laid outside the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia. Its surgical director told the BBC's International editor Jeremy Bowen that it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead, and that the majority were children and women.
Dr Mohamed el-Ron also said there were severely wounded people needing complex surgery who had to be transferred ""under fire"" to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
Médecins Sans Frontières quoted one of its nurses at Al-Shifa, Mohammed Hawajreh, as saying: ""Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families. Many were screaming and asking for their parents.""
Later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had a carried out a ""wide-scale strike on terrorists and terror infrastructure belonging to the Central Jabaliya Battalion"" and killed its commander, Ibrahim Biari.
""The strike damaged Hamas's command and control in the area, as well as its ability to direct military activity against IDF soldiers operating throughout the Gaza Strip,"" it added.
""A large number of terrorists who were with Biari were killed. Underground terror infrastructure embedded beneath the buildings, used by the terrorists, also collapsed after the strike.""
IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari did not directly address the reported civilian casualties at a briefing, but he said: ""The Hamas terrorists continue to use civilian population as protective armour. This is intentional and devastatingly barbaric.""
A Hamas spokesman was quoted by Al Arabiya TV as denying that a commander had been in Jabalia, accusing the IDF of ""false and unfounded talk"" intended to ""justify its heinous crime"".
The IDF also said that its ground forces had killed about 50 Hamas fighters during an operation to secure a military stronghold in western Jabalia that served as a training centre for the 7 October attack and contained tunnels used as a passageway to the Mediterranean coast.
Two Israeli soldiers were killed during the battle, according to Adm Hagari.
Hamas's military wing said its fighters had hit four Israeli military vehicles within southern Gaza, fired at tanks and bulldozers in north-west Gaza, and ambushed an Israeli unit in the north-east.
Hamas and other Palestinian groups also continued to fire rockets into Israel. Four people in the coastal city of Ashdod were wounded in two attacks.
Following Tuesday's strike in Jabalia, Adm Hagari once again called on all civilians in the camp and elsewhere in northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.
Hundreds of thousands of people have not heeded the order, which the IDF first issued on 13 October.
The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients and medical staff. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools and other public buildings.
On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said it was extremely concerned by reports of air strikes in the vicinity of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital over the last two days. The hospital, which is located south of Gaza City, is the main cancer centre in the Gaza Strip.
The BBC verified a video circulated on social media on Monday in which smoke can be seen outside the hospital and an explosion can be heard.
The Israeli military told the BBC that it had not stuck the hospital, but it did not deny that there may have been strikes in the area.
Dr Richard Brennan, the WHO's regional emergency director, also warned that the wider health situation in Gaza was ""essentially catastrophic"", with 8,525 deaths from trauma reported by the health ministry, over a third of hospitals not functioning, and the rest overwhelmed by patients.
""Anaesthetics and painkillers are running short, so doctors are doing procedures without the right medicine and equipment, and patients are suffering incredible because of that,"" he told the BBC.
Dr Brennan also said the UN had already started to see infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections among the 1.4 million displaced people living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions.
The US said on Monday night that it was confident there would be an increase in humanitarian aid entering southern Gaza via Egypt's Rafah border crossing in the coming days.
In recent days, there has been a small rise in the deliveries of food, water and medicine being allowed in, but UN agencies said the promised 100 lorryloads a day were a fraction of what was needed.
Israel is not permitting deliveries of fuel - crucial to run hospitals and bakeries, and for purifying and pumping water - because it says it could be used by Hamas for military purposes.
The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf said he saw hundreds of people queuing for a small bottle of clean drinking water from a UN tanker outside a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis on Tuesday.
A father who had to queue for six hours to get five Arabic flatbreads to feed his family told him: ""This is not enough.""

Israeli forces fight to drive out Hamas militants as death toll passes 600,,BBC,"By Yolande Knell, Rushi Abu Alouf & David Gritten","Israeli security forces are carrying out operations to rescue hostages taken by Palestinian militants from Gaza and clear areas they seized on Saturday.
The military said troops had secured 22 locations by Sunday morning but were still sweeping through another eight.
The surprise attack by hundreds of gunmen from Hamas, under the cover of intense rocket fire, has reportedly killed at least 600 people in Israel.
More than 370 people in Gaza have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes.
And 400 Palestinian gunmen have been killed and dozens arrested during the fighting in Israel, according to the Israeli military.
Saturday saw Israel's deadliest day of violence since the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday night that Israel was going into a ""long and difficult war"". He also warned Hamas, which governs Gaza, that its hideouts would be reduced to ""rubble"".
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said it was on the ""verge of a great victory"".
The attack began just after dawn on Saturday, which was the Jewish Sabbath and festival of Simchat Torah.
Hamas gunmen cut through the heavily fortified fence that lines Gaza's perimeter and crossed into southern Israel on motorbikes, paragliders and by sea.
An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said the militants numbered in the high hundreds, while more than 3,000 rockets were fired towards cities and towns across Israel throughout the day.
""They attacked dozens of Israeli communities and IDF bases and went door to door,"" Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said Saturday night. ""They executed Israeli civilians in cold blood in their homes and then continued to drag into Gaza Israeli civilians and military personnel.""
Israel's health ministry has not officially confirmed how many people have been killed, but Israeli TV channels reported that the death toll had passed 600 andthe same figure was included in a Facebook post from the Government Press Office.
Overnight, Israeli security forces rescued many people who had been held hostage - almost 50 were in the dining area of one small community.
At least 10 militants who had taken over the police station in the town of Sderot were killed.
Through Sunday morning shootings continued in communities close to Gaza.
Near the city of Ashkelon, Israeli forces chased several Palestinian gunmen in a stolen car, killing them in a dramatic shootout on a main road.
The IDF earlier told reporters that security forces had secured 22 locations but that there were still eight ""points of engagement"" where troops were going from house to house to confirm that they were ""clean or terrorism"".
They included Sderot and the nearby kibbutz (community) of Kfar Aza, where soldiers were said to be fighting to free another group of hostages.
Residents who live near the Gaza frontier are also being evacuated.
Concerns are also growing for the dozens of Israeli soldiers and civilians, including women and children, who it is believed are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.
Relatives of those missing have been asked to hand their belongings to police stations so that DNA samples can be taken.
Noa Argamani, 25, and her boyfriend Avinatan Or were among hundreds of people partying at a rave in the fields next to Gaza when the attack began. A video posted on social media showed Ms Argamani screaming in panic as she was taken by militants into Gaza on a motorbike.
A friend, Amit Parpara, told the BBC that she sent him several messages as the attack unfolded.
""My first contact with Noa was around 06:30, when the [rockets] started,"" he said. ""She sent me her live location, asking for someone to save her and her boyfriend. She was hiding in a hole.""
""Around 08:30 was the last message that I got from her,"" he added. ""I tried to tell her to stay low. I tried to contact the police and the military so that they would know their location and might find them.""
""About half an hour later, I found that video... You can see clearly her terror.""
Mr Netanyahu warned Hamas that Israel held it responsible for the hostages' well-being and would ""settle accounts with anyone who harms one hair on their heads"".
He also said the IDF would ""immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities,"" and told Gazans to leave their homes and take shelter.
In Gaza, the atmosphere has changed completely from Saturday morning, when many Palestinians were celebrating on the streets. People are now staying indoors, as the territory is rocked by explosions and clouds of black smoke engulf buildings.
The IDF said it had struck 426 targets belonging to Hamas by Sunday morning, including a compound belonging to the head of the group's intelligence department.
Hamas said 12 houses belonging to senior leaders of the group were hit, as well as branches of its bank.
The multi-storey Watan Tower in Gaza City, where internet service providers that served half of the population were based, was also destroyed.
Palestinian health ministry officials said more than 300 people, including children, had been killed in Gaza and that another 1,990 had been injured.
About 20,000 people have taken shelter in UN schools and hospitals after being told by the IDF to leave their homes immediately, suggesting that they would be attacked by air soon. The Israeli warnings covered Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, and the Daraj area of Gaza City.
Dr Khamis Elessi, a neuro-rehabilitation and pain medicine consultant based in Gaza City, told the BBC that the situation was unbearable.
""Everywhere you are going in Gaza you see funerals, you see death. You see buildings collapsing. It's like you are watching a movie about the end of life on this Earth,"" he said.
""The kids are crying and screaming, there is no electricity, there's no internet and so you feel you could be next.""
Israel's security cabinet cut off Gaza's electricity and fuel supplies and the entry of goods in retaliation for the Hamas attack.
In a separate development on Sunday, the IDF said its artillery had struck targets in southern Lebanon and carried out a drone strike on ""terrorist infrastructure"" in response to a rocket attack by the militant Hezbollah movement in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area.
Hezbollah said it had fired at three Israeli positions ""in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance"", despite a warning from Israel and the US for other parties not to engage and risk a regional war.
The Lebanese army said the Israeli retaliatory fire wounded several people, while the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon said it was working with authorities in both countries to avoid a more serious escalation.

Jenin: Palestinian boy killed during Israeli assault was unarmed - family,2023-07-10,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"Eyewitnesses and the family of a 16-year-old Palestinian shot dead during Israel's military assault in Jenin have told the BBC he was unarmed and killed ""for no reason"", after videos emerged of the moment of his death.
Twelve Palestinians, including four teenage children, and one Israeli soldier were killed during the two-day incursion in the occupied West Bank last week.
Israel said all the Palestinians who were killed were combatants.
But the videos show Abdul Rahman Hassan Ahmad Hardan, 16, was unarmed when he was shot.
The teenager was shot in the head outside al-Amal hospital on the second day of the military incursion, which Israel said was intended to root out a ""safe haven of terrorism"" in Jenin refugee camp.
It follows over a year of rising numbers of Palestinian armed attacks targeting Israelis, while Israel has intensified its deadly military raids in the West Bank. At least 160 Palestinians and more than 30 Israelis have been killed since January.
Israel's government said its military operation last week was to stop the camp being a ""refuge"" for armed groups. It said it seized ""hundreds"" of guns and other weapons, including ""advanced"" improvised explosives.
It was its biggest assault in the West Bank in two decades, involving drone strikes into a packed urban area and armoured diggers causing massive destruction.
The United Nations accused Israel of using excessive force, while the Palestinian leadership called it a ""war crime"".
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht, asked by the BBC last week about the casualties, said: ""There were 12 people killed, every one that was killed was involved directly with terrorism.""
""A 17-year-old may be regarded as a minor but he's holding weapons and firing... We can show that evidence. We have pictures of all of them, and intel that they were involved.""
After his death, Abdul Rahman Hardan was claimed as a member by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. However, his family has distanced itself from the claim, and Israel has yet to show evidence he posed a threat at the time he was fatally shot.
Under international law, the use of firearms by security forces against civilians is defined as a measure of last resort, and can only take place to stop an ""imminent threat of death or serious injury"".
Children are also given added protections under international humanitarian law.
Sixteen-year-old Abdul Rahman was killed at 13:00 (10:00 GMT) on Tuesday, as confrontations had continued in the city. Some involved gunmen firing towards Israeli forces.
Others involved Palestinian youths throwing rocks at Israeli jeeps and armoured troop carriers - a frequent occurrence as young men try to repel Israel's military raids into Palestinian cities.
In one video, first verified by the Times newspaper, the teenager can be seen standing in the street next to al-Amal hospital, close to a group of boys or young men. Rocks or other debris appear on the ground in the vicinity. No weapons are visible and Abdul Rahman appears unarmed.
Around 13 seconds into the footage, which has no sound, he leans forward to look down a street next to the hospital. He is then seen falling to the ground, having been shot in the head.
The original source of the video is not known to the BBC, but the boy's family and the eyewitnesses verified it as showing Abdul Rahman being shot.
A second video filmed by a journalist outside the hospital shows the following moments, in which a paramedic rushes to Abdul Rahman and picks him up before carrying him along the street. The boy is suffering a catastrophic bleed from the head as he is carried towards the hospital entrance.
No weapons are visible in the area where the teenager fell nor elsewhere in the footage.
The IDF said it was inconclusive as to whether the footage documented the killing of Abdul Rahman by its forces.
Islamic Jihad - listed by Israel and the West as a terrorist organisation - claimed the 16-year-old as a fighter. Social media pictures later emerged in which he had posed with assault rifles at unknown dates. Such pictures are not uncommon among young men and teenagers in Jenin and surrounding villages.
The refugee camp is a highly militarised environment where the official Palestinian leadership has lost control, and armed groups see themselves as a core of resistance to Israel's military occupation - now into its 57th year. Human rights groups have frequently condemned militant groups putting weapons in the hands of minors.
The teenager's father, Hassan Ahmad Hardan, told the BBC that his son was on his way to the hospital to donate blood when an Israeli military vehicle entered the street.
""He was standing in the street to cross it when they shot him in the head from the back,"" said Mr Hardan.
""He did not carry anything with him - no stone, no weapon, nothing,"" he added.
In an interview with the Times, his family also said Abdul Rahman was not a militant and did not belong to any armed group.
Two eyewitnesses also told the BBC the teenager was unarmed.
""We were standing in one of the streets near the presence of occupation [Israeli] forces. After that, the occupation sniper shot the martyr Abdul Rahman without any reason or justification,"" said one eyewitness, who asked that his name was not published.
""The martyr was unarmed and did not carry anything,"" he added.
Of the 12 Palestinians killed in Jenin last week, two were aged 16 and two were 17 years old. Ten of the total were claimed as members by militant groups.
The IDF said it continued to examine the video, asking to receive it in its ""unedited entirety"".
In a statement, a spokesman said: ""As of this time, it is not possible to say with certainty that the video does indeed document the neutralization of Abdul Rahman Hassan by IDF forces.""
The spokesman said it was ""unfortunate"" that earlier reports ""discounted the Islamic Jihad's claim of responsibility for the neutralized terrorist and his association with the terrorist organization"".
He went on: ""The IDF operated in a densely populated and complex combat zone, where hundreds of armed gunmen fired indiscriminately in the area. The IDF does everything in its power to avoid harming uninvolved individuals and operates precisely against terrorist organisations.""

Israeli troops will not face criminal charges over Palestinian-American's death,2023-06-14,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"Israel's military has said no criminal charges will be filed against soldiers who gagged and bound an elderly Palestinian-American man who then died of heart failure.
Omar Asad, 80, was detained at a temporary checkpoint in the occupied West Bank overnight in January 2022.
The soldiers left him unresponsive on the ground of a construction site and said they assumed he had fallen asleep.
Palestinian leaders say this case shows the near impunity of Israeli soldiers.
They have called for those involved to be prosecuted in an international court.
Mr Asad had been out drinking coffee and playing cardsbeforedriving to his home in the village of Jiljilya, near Ramallah, his family said, when his car was stopped at a temporary checkpoint in the early hours of the morning.
Israeli soldiers are said to have been in the area ""to thwart terrorist activity and locate illegal weapons"".
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Mr Asad ""loudly and persistently"" resisted attempts to lead him away from his car.
It added that he was briefly gagged with a strip of cloth and his hands were tied with a cable tie ""due to the concern that Asad's behaviour would lead to the soldiers being exposed and in view of his aggressive resistance"".
He was taken to a nearby building where three other Palestinians were later detained too.
""The soldiers believed Asad was under the influence of alcohol or drugs and assumed he fell asleep on the ground, where he was laid,"" the IDF statement said.
Before the Israeli soldiers left the area, they found Mr Asad lying face upwards andunresponsive but ""did not identify any indications that Asad was in distress"", according to the IDF. ""Therefore, they assumed he was asleep, did not attempt to wake him up, and left the location.""
His body was later found there.
Palestinian doctors said Mr Asad, who had previously undergone heart surgery, suffered sudden cardiac arrest caused by the stress of physical violence. A post-mortem exam found abrasions on his wrists and bleeding on the insides of his eyelids.
After an initial investigation, the IDF dismissed two officers and reprimanded a battalion commander over the death, saying it resulted from ""a moral failure and poor decision-making"".
But now the Military Advocate General has said there will be no criminal prosecution because a military medic found it impossible to determine that Mr Asad's death was caused specifically by the soldiers' conduct, and that the soldiers could not have been aware of his medical condition. They will face further disciplinary and command measures.
""The IDF laments Assad's death and works to prevent the recurrence of such incidents,"" the Military Advocate General said.
At the time of Mr Asad's death, the US said it was ""deeply concerned"" and expected ""a thorough criminal investigation and full accountability"". Mr Asad had spent years living in the US and his children and grandchildren continueto live there.
Mr Asad had been waiting for years for Israel to reinstate his Palestinian ID card so that he could travel to the US to visit his relatives and then return home to the West Bank.
The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Israeli military prosecutor's decision to close the case, describing what happened to Mr Asad as a crime and calling on the US to investigate.
In a statement, the ministry said there was ""an official Israeli policy"", which was meant ""to give the impression that there are Israeli investigations into the ongoing crimes committed by the occupation army"" and ""to mislead countries, the international community, and global public opinion"".
A report by the Israeli rights group Yesh Din, based on military data from 2017 to 2021, found that Israeli forces were prosecuted for less than 1% of the hundreds of complaints filed against them on alleged offences against Palestinians.
In the rare cases where soldiers were convicted of harming Palestinians, military courts handed down ""extremely lenient sentences"", according to the report.
""All of this speaks to a reluctance on the part of the military law enforcement system to take appropriate action concerning crimes committed by soldiers against Palestinians,"" it said.

Bringing broken survivors of the Israel Nova festival attack back from darkness,2023-12-07,BBC,By Anna Foster,"""You can cry here,"" the sign reads in pale blue lettering on a clean white background.
Beyond it, comfortable sofas piled with cushions are screened off from the rest of the room. It's a safe, private corner where survivors of the Nova music festival can be with others who went through the same ordeal on 7 October, and get the mental health support many of them desperately need.
More than 360 young partygoers were shot, beaten or burnt to death by Hamas attackers, who stormed the festival site near the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence early that morning. Another 40 were taken hostage.
First, social media posts showed panicked crowds fleeing from rockets fired from Gaza and gunmen on the ground. Later, distressing videos from first responders began to confirm the scale of the massacre, as they filmed scores of murdered partygoers.
In the following days, Dr Lia Naor realised that - unlike those who'd been evacuated from their nearby kibbutzim - the young people from the festival who lived through the ordeal didn't have a community already around them to give support.
So she built one.
""I just wanted them to be held,"" Dr Naor explains.
""They were so fragmented and so frozen. Then there was the brokenness of faith that they that had felt - there'd been nobody there for them, not their parents, not the army, not the police. Nobody was there to save them. So the first thing was just getting them to feel secure and in a healing space.""
The outdoor setting in Rishpon, north of Tel Aviv, is sheltered and peaceful. The early December days have been warm in Israel, and people sit on colourful beanbags scattered across the grass. A timetable is propped up showing the range of workshops that day, from mosaic making to sound baths. There's massage, group music, and singing sessions.
A few placid dogs roam through the group, waiting to be stroked or begging for food. One tiny, black-haired crossbreed chihuahua has a pair of silver wings on its back, drawing coos of appreciation. It's a different scene from the early days.
""Even though their bodies were whole, we saw how broken they were and that their eyes were hollow,"" Lia remembers. ""They didn't look alive. They couldn't look at us. They would shake, they couldn't eat, they couldn't drink. The evil that these people met is incomprehensible.
""I told them early on, 'As dark the darkness is that you saw, we're going to bring the light. We're going to help you believe in yourselves and in others again.'""
This place is a huge collective effort, but it hasn't been driven by the state.
Everybody here is a volunteer giving their time for free and hoping to heal themselves too. The homemade food spread out on low tables is donated by charities and businesses. Everyone wants to do something to help in the aftermath of one of Israel's darkest moments.
Lior Gelbaum is a Nova survivor. I compliment her on the tiny jewels she's stuck under each eye, sparkling in the light, and she tells me they make her feel festive again. The 24-year-old from the city of Petah Tikva is coming here regularly to get support and give out handmade silver necklaces to others who were there that day.
She remembers it well.
""At 06:30 in the morning, we started hearing rockets flying above our heads,"" she tells me. ""We know the drill, so we got into our car and started driving away, but there was a traffic jam. We started hearing gunshots above our heads, so we got out and just started running towards the open field. We didn't know where we were going or what was happening, we just heard automatic gunshots all around us. Two people, Yehuda and Galit, had a big car and got us inside it and away. They saved us.""
Lior also talks about the importance of music to her healing process.
""Everyone that was at the Nova festival, we love to dance, we love to be together. After the massacre happened, it was important for the community to get back together and to strengthen each other, to be with each other and talk and feel our emotions.""
But she says she's been struggling to enjoy something which is a huge part of her identity.
""It's been hard for me to listen to music since the Nova festival, and still I only feel comfortable listening to music at concerts with the artists that come to this place,"" Lia says.
Above the seating area, a huge garden stretches up a low hill. It's framed with trees laden with citrus fruits and row after row of bushy herbs, the rosemary and sage scenting the air.
The survivors often walk through it and pick the leaves to turn into herbal teas. Nature is a big part of this place. The need for space is so great that new rustic tents are being built to make room for the hundreds of people who are now coming here.
Each day, professional clinical psychologists mix with the survivors who arrive. They're there to talk as much or as little as needed.
Dr Itamar Cohen is one of them. He flew in from London as soon as he could after 7 October.
I ask about the stories he's heard. He breathes deeply, then answers.
""People here have seen a tremendous amount of pain. Some of them were extremely close to not being here any more. Some were chased and had to run for their lives. There wasn't much time to process that, just running away from a massacre. And now they still need to function, and they still need to go and push through.""
There's another element too.
""A lot of people are experiencing some sort of grief, they lost tens of their friends at one time. And there's guilt. 'Why am I the one who survived and not my friend? I should have picked up more survivors inside my car to drive them to safety.' So a lot of thoughts around, 'I am not really worthy of being saved and I could have done better.'""
Dr Cohen tells me that being around other therapists at a dark time helps them all.
""We have time to see together, to process and to speak about the challenges and our vulnerabilities, and our fears and sense of guilt. It means we have a space to work that through and to strengthen each other, and it helps me as well, tremendously.""

Gaza: Sixth militant commander killed in Israeli air strike,,BBC,By David Gritten & Raffi Berg,"Israel has killed a sixth senior leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in an air strike in the Gaza Strip, as fighting between them escalated.
It said Iyad al-Hassani had directed the militant group's operations since his predecessor was killed on Tuesday.
Friday's strike, which medics said also killed another person, followed a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza, some of which reached near Jerusalem.
The chances of an imminent ceasefire appeared slim after the exchange.
However, a Palestinian official familiar with the talks taking place in Egypt told the BBC that Egyptian officials ""presented this evening a new proposal for a ceasefire, which is being studied now"". Egypt was also waiting for Israel's response, they added.
At least 33 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed - about half of them civilians - since Israel carried out a series of air strikes early on Tuesday that killed three top PIJ commanders, the Palestinian health ministry there says. Another 147 people have been wounded.
One Israeli civilian has been killed and five wounded by Palestinian rocket fire in the same period, Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service says.
The fighting which resumed on Friday came after 12 hours of relative calm, during which there were several Israeli air strikes but no Palestinian rocket attacks.
Around midday PIJ militants launched dozens of rockets. Some were aimed towards the Jerusalem area, about 65km (40 miles) from Gaza.
The Israeli military said two rockets heading to Jerusalem were intercepted, but another rocket reportedly landed in an open field near the Jewish settlement of Bat Ayin in the occupied West Bank, about 16km south of the city.
PIJ said ""the firing of rockets at Jerusalem is a message, and everyone should understand its aim"".
Targeting Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital, is meant to signal to Israel that the group is prepared to connect events in the city to those in Gaza.
It is the first time rockets have landed near there since a 10-day conflict between Israel and militants in Gaza in May 2021.
Israel responded to Friday's rocket fire with intensive air strikes.
Warplanes hit a multi-storey residential building in the northern Nasser area of Gaza City, killing two people. Five others were wounded, including a child, according to rescuers.
A PIJ spokesman confirmed the death of Iyad al-Hassani, according to AFP news agency.
Sources said Hassani was deputy head of Islamic Jihad's armed wing and the most senior figure in the group to be targeted by Israel so far in the fighting.
Israel's air force said Hassani had replaced Khalil al-Bahtini, who was killed on Tuesday, as PIJ's ""commanding officer of the operation in the Gaza Strip"" and described him as a ""significant figure"".
The identity of the second person was not immediately clear, but the air force described them as a PIJ ""operative"".
An Israeli official told the BBC hitting the senior chain of command was also meant as a warning to Hamas, the dominant armed group in Gaza, which so far is thought to have stayed on the sidelines of the current escalation.
More rockets were fired at southern Israeli communities following the strike and Israel said there was likely to be more long-range fire in response to what it called the ""targeted killing"" of Hassani.
On Thursday, another two top PIJ commanders - the head of its rocket launching force and his deputy - were killed in Israeli strikes in southern Gaza.
This week's fighting is the heaviest since three days of hostilities between Israel and PIJ last August, in which 49 Palestinians were killed in Gaza.
At least 973 rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza over the past four days, with 761 crossing into Israeli territory, according to the military. Most have been intercepted or have landed in open areas.
The military says 181 of the rockets fell short inside Gaza and that they have killed four people there, including three children. Islamic Jihad denies the allegation.
The military also says its strikes have hit 254 PIJ targets in Gaza. According to Gaza's housing ministry, 28 homes have been destroyed, 37 damaged so badly that they are uninhabitable, and 495 partly damaged.
Meanwhile, a British surgeon stranded in Gaza has told the BBC that more than 140 ""desperately sick"" patients there, most of whom have cancer, are being denied urgently-needed treatment while the crossing to Israel remains shut for a fourth day.
""The doctors I work with here have got multiple examples of people who are in desperate need of cancer treatment,"" Professor Nick Maynard said.
""These treatments are undoubtedly being delayed and potentially leading to deaths because of the delays now,"" he added.

How Hamas built a force to attack Israel on 7 October,,BBC,"By Abdelali Ragad, Richard Irvine-Brown, Benedict Garman and Sean Seddon","Five armed Palestinian groups joined Hamas in the deadly 7 October attack on Israel after training together in military-style exercises from 2020 onwards, BBC News analysis shows.
The groups carried out joint drills in Gaza which closely resembled the tactics used during the deadly assault - including at a site less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the barrier with Israel - and posted them on social media.
They practised hostage-taking, raiding compounds and breaching Israel's defences during these exercises, the last of which was held just 25 days before the attack.
BBC Arabic and BBC Verify have collated evidence which shows how Hamas brought together Gaza's factions to hone their combat methods - and ultimately execute a raid into Israel which has plunged the region into war.
On 29 December 2020, Hamas's overall leader Ismail Haniyeh declared the first of four drills codenamed Strong Pillar a ""strong message and a sign of unity"" between Gaza's various armed factions.
As the most powerful of Gaza's armed groups, Hamas was the dominant force in a coalition which brought together 10 other Palestinian factions in a war games-style exercise overseen by a ""joint operation room"".
The structure was set up in 2018 to coordinate Gaza's armed factions under a central command.
Prior to 2018, Hamas had formally coordinated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Gaza's second largest armed faction and - like Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries.
Hamas had also fought alongside other groups in previous conflicts, but the 2020 drill was billed in propaganda as evidence a wider array of groups were being unified.
Hamas's leader said the first drill reflected the ""permanent readiness"" of the armed factions.
The 2020 exercise was the first of four joint drills held over three years, each of which was documented in polished videos posted on public social media channels.
The BBC has visually identified 10 groups, including PIJ, by their distinctive headbands and emblems training alongside Hamas during the Strong Pillar drills in footage posted on the messaging app Telegram.
Following the 7 October attack, five of the groups went on to post videos claiming to show them taking part in the assault. Three others issued written statements on Telegram claiming to have participated.
The role of these groups has come into sharp focus as pressure builds on Hamas to find dozens of women and children believed to have been taken as captives from Israel into Gaza by other factions on 7 October.
Three groups - PIJ, the Mujahideen Brigades and Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades - claim to have seized Israeli hostages, alongside Hamas, on that day.
Efforts to extend the temporary truce in Gaza were said to be hinging on Hamas locating those hostages.
While these groups are drawn from a broad ideological spectrum ranging from hard-line Islamist to relatively secular, all shared a willingness to use violence against Israel.
Hamas statements repeatedly stressed the theme of unity between Gaza's disparate armed groups. The group suggested they were equal partners in the joint drills, whilst it continued to play a leading role in the plans to attack Israel.
Footage from the first drill shows masked commanders in a bunker appearing to conduct the exercise, and begins with a volley of rocket fire.
It cuts to heavily armed fighters overrunning a mocked-up tank marked with an Israeli flag, detaining a crew member and dragging him away as a prisoner, as well as raiding buildings.
We know from videos and harrowing witness statements that both tactics were used to capture soldiers and target civilians on 7 October, when around 1,200 people were killed and an estimated 240 hostages were taken.
The second Strong Pillar drill was held almost exactly one year later.
Ayman Nofal, a commander in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - the official name for Hamas's armed wing - said the aim of the exercise on 26 December 2021 was to ""affirm the unity of the resistance factions"".
He said the drills would ""tell the enemy that the walls and engineering measures on the borders of Gaza will not protect them"".
Another Hamas statement said the ""joint military manoeuvres"" were designed to ""simulate the liberation of settlements near Gaza"" - which is how the group refers to Israeli communities.
The exercise was repeated on 28 December 2022, and propaganda images of fighters practising clearing buildings and overrunning tanks in what appears to be a replica of a military base were published to mark the event.
The exercises were reported on in Israel, so it's inconceivable they were not being closely monitored by the country's extensive intelligence agencies.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously carried out air strikes to disrupt Hamas's training activities. In April 2023, they bombed the site used for the first Strong Pillar drill.
Weeks before the attacks, female surveillance soldiers near the Gaza border reportedly warned of unusually high drone activity and that Hamas was training to take over observation posts with replicas of their positions.
But,according to reports in the Israeli media, they say they were ignored.
Brigadier General Amir Avivi, a former IDF deputy commander in Gaza, told the BBC:  ""There was a lot of intelligence that they were doing this training - after all, the videos are public, and this was happening just hundreds of metres from the fence (with Israel).""
But he said while the military knew about the drills, they ""didn't see what they were training for"".
The IDF said they ""eliminated"" Nofal on 17 October 2023, the first senior Hamas military leader to be killed during the conflict.
Hamas went to great lengths to make sure the drills were realistic.
In 2022, fighters practised storming a mock Israeli military base built just 2.6km (1.6 miles) from the Erez crossing, a route between Gaza and Israel controlled by the IDF.
BBC Verify has pinpointed the site in the far north of Gaza, just 800m (0.5 miles) from the barrier, by matching geographic features seen in the training footage to aerial images of the area. As of November 2023, the site was still visible on Bing Maps.
The training camp was within 1.6km (1 mile) of an Israeli observation tower and an elevated observation box, elements in a security barrier Israel has spent hundreds of millions of dollars constructing.
The mock base is on land dug several metres below ground level, so it may not have been immediately visible to any nearby Israeli patrols - but the smoke rising from the explosions surely would have been, and the IDF is known to use aerial surveillance.
Hamas used this site to practise storming buildings, taking hostages at gunpoint and destroying security barriers.
BBC Verify has used publicly available information - including satellite imagery - to locate 14 training sites at nine different locations across Gaza.
They even trained twice at a site less than 1.6 km (1 mile) from the United Nations' aid agency distribution centre, and which was visible in the background of an official video published by the agency in December 2022.
On 10 September 2023, the so-called joint committee room published images on its dedicated Telegram channel of men in military uniforms carrying out surveillance of military installations along the Gaza barrier.
Two days later, the fourth Strong Pillar military exercise was staged, and by 7 October, all the tactics that would be deployed in the unprecedented attack had been rehearsed.
Fighters were filmed riding in the same type of white Toyota pickup trucks which were seen roaming through southern Israel the following month.
The propaganda video shows gunmen raiding mock buildings and firing at dummy targets inside, as well as training to storm a beach using a boat and underwater divers. Israel has said it repelled attempted Hamas boat landings on its shores on 7 October.
However, Hamas did not publicise its training with motorcycles and paragliders as part of the Strong Pillar propaganda.
A training video posted by Hamas three days after 7 October shows fences and barriers being demolished to allow motorcycles to pass through, a tactic they used to reach communities in southern Israel. We have not identified similar earlier videos.
Footage of fighters using paragliding equipment was also not published until the 7 October attack was under way.
In a training video shared on the day of the attack, gunmen are seen landing in a mock kibbutz at an airstrip we have located to a site north of Rafah in southern Gaza.
BBC Verify established it was recorded some time before 25 August 2022, and was stored in a computer file titled Eagle Squadron, the name Hamas uses for its aerial division - suggesting the paragliders plan was in the works for over a year.
Before 7 October, Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in the Gaza Strip, according to reports quoting IDF commanders. It was also thought that Hamas could draw on several thousands of fighters from smaller groups.
Hamas is by far the most powerful of the Palestinian armed groups, even without the support of other factions - suggesting its interest in galvanising the factions was driven by an attempt to secure broad support within Gaza at least as much as bolstering its own numbers.
The IDF has previously estimated 1,500 fighters joined the 7 October raids. TheTimes of Israelreported earlier this month the IDF now believes the number was closer to 3,000.
Whatever the true number, it means only a relatively small fraction of the total number of armed operatives in Gaza took part. It is not possible to verify precise numbers for how many fighters from smaller groups took part in the attack or the Strong Pillar drills.
While Hamas was building cross-faction support in the build-up to the attack, Hisham Jaber, a former Brigadier General in the Lebanese army who is now a security analyst at the Middle East Centre for Studies and Research, said he believed only Hamas was aware of the ultimate plan, and it was ""probable [they] asked other factions to join on the day"".
Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at Kings College London, told the BBC: ""While there was centralised planning, execution was de-centralised, with each squad operationalising the plan as they saw fit.""
He said people inside Hamas were said to be surprised by the weakness of Israel's defences, and assessed militants had likely bypassed Israel's surveillance technology by communicating offline.
Hugh Lovatt, a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel would have been aware of the joint training drills but ""reached the wrong conclusion"", assessing they amounted to the ""standard"" activity of paramilitary groups in the Palestinian territories, rather than being ""indicative of a looming large-scale attack"".
Asked about the issues raised in this article, the Israel Defense Forces said it was ""currently focused on eliminating the threat from the terrorist organisation Hamas"" and questions about any potential failures ""will be looked into in a later stage"".
It could be several years until Israel formally reckons with whether it missed opportunities to prevent the 7 October massacre.
The ramifications for its military, intelligence services and government could be seismic.

Israel-Lebanon border: The Irish troops watching Israel’s hidden conflict,,BBC,"By Nafiseh Kohnavard, Middle East correspondent","""If you hear an alarm sounding it means you need to run to the nearest bunker,"" says Captain Aódhan McGuinness as we arrive at Camp Shamrock.
He is the tactical operations director for the Irish troops who run this UN peacekeeping base close to the Lebanon-Israel border.
We can hear the buzz of Israeli drones hovering overhead. They sound like hair dryers or electric razors, and are now a constant presence day and night above towns and villages in southern Lebanon.
A loud explosion nearby interrupts Captain McGuinness' safety briefing.
""Ok, today's round has started,"" he says.
The blast is yet another sign of escalating tensions in the area since Hamas launched its unprecedented assault on Israel back in October.
The UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, is responsible for monitoring the Blue Line, the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel.
During the last four decades the area has witnessed on and off clashes between the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group, Hezbollah, and the Israeli army.
While Hezbollah is labelled a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and others, it is a mainstream political party in Lebanon, leading an alliance which fell just short of a majority in the national parliament in elections last year.
Wearing body armour and helmets we join a group of heavily armed peacekeepers in a convoy of armoured vehicles for a 20-minute drive to another base that is just 500m (1,600ft) from the Blue Line.
With Israeli military installations visible across the frontier, the commander of the outpost, Lieutenant Dylan Cadogan, says they often have to take shelter in bunkers during strikes, sometimes for hours.
""We have seen houses destroyed and we have seen civilians caught in crossfire that needed our help.""
From the base's watchtower he points at a pink house in the distance: ""There was a mother and a child in that building only 400m (1,300ft) from us.
""Their house was shelled, and they had to run here to take refuge and we provided them with medical support and took them to safety.""
The Unifil troops have recovered the bodies of people killed in the fighting but cannot say how many were Hezbollah fighters due to the sensitivity of their mission and the need to remain neutral between the warring parties.
""It is not our job to comment on these, just observe, monitor and report what we see to our headquarters,"" Lieutenant Cadogan says.
Since Israel launched its offensive on Gaza following Hamas's attack on 7 October, Hezbollah has regularly carried out rocket and drone attacks from southern Lebanon, some aimed at military targets, others fired more indiscriminately into northern Israel.
Israeli forces have retaliated with heavy air strikes and artillery fire.
Due to the fighting 60,000 people have been displaced from the border area on the Lebanese side, while thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from northern Israel.
Monitoring groups say that in the first week following Hamas's attack in October there were around 70 reported incidents near the Blue Line, and by mid-November it had risen to about 250 attacks a week.
The peacekeeping force was first deployed in 1978 after Israel invaded southern Lebanon in response to cross border attacks from there by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).
Since then, more than 300 peacekeepers have been killed, 48 of them Irish, something which is on the minds of the troops' families.
Captain Tony Smith, 27, on his second deployment, regularly reassures his relatives back home in Wexford, in south east Ireland.
""Of course my mother wants me to go home now, which eventually I will, but she knows why we are here and despite her concerns she supports that.""
Approaching the nearby town of Tebnine, posters of Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah and fallen Hezbollah fighters line the road.
It's 10km (6.2 miles) from the Blue Line and has been heavily damaged in previous conflicts.
Like most of the towns and villages in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is very influential here and controls security in the area.
One of the local residents, 57-year-old Ali Saad, says he grew up with the Irish Unifil soldiers.
Speaking with a distinctive Irish accent, Ali says one peacekeeper helped teach him English when he was a young boy.
That soldier was one of three generations of the same Irish family to serve with Unifil. His father also served several decades ago, and his son is currently stationed in Lebanon.
Ali credits the Irish troops with helping to save his life when they picked him up from school and took him to one of their bunkers during an air strike.
In the years since, he has worked as a translator for Unifil and a group of Irish soldiers even attended his wedding to his wife, Bassima, who also helps the peacekeepers with language services.
But while Ali values the troops' presence, he is sad that the conflict they are there to monitor has dragged on so long.
""To be honest we never thought this mission would last for over 44 years,"" he says.
For Bassima the current fighting has brought back painful memories of earlier conflicts, like the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.
""I was putting my younger son inside an empty washing machine because I was hoping that it could project him,"" she says.
""Now, we keep hearing all these sounds of explosions and I just can't take it.""
She believes that growing up surrounded by conflict has affected her son, who is now 23. He still gets nervous when Unifil helicopters fly overhead.
""We can't go back to where we were,"" she adds. ""We are wasting our life from one conflict to another, I just cannot go through another war.""
Back at the base, Unifil commander Lieutenant Colonel Cathal Keohane is concerned that the level of violence in the area has been increasing.
""We have seen an expansion and more attacks deeper inside to Lebanon, we have seen a wider range of weapons being used,"" he says, worrying that the situation could escalate.
""Whether it arises deliberately from one side, or some inadvertent circumstances precipitate the outbreak of all-out war, that is a serious concern for us.""
He hopes that the ceasefire in Gaza will lead to an easing of tensions around the Blue Line, but says it could take displaced people some time to return to their homes, even if the cross border fire ends.

"The world is losing its humanity, UNRWA chief says",,BBC,By Jeremy Bowen in Jerusalem and Toby Luckhurst in London,"The Middle East is on the ""edge of an abyss"" as a result of the war between Israel and Hamas, UN agency chief Philippe Lazzarini has told the BBC.
The commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA said violence could spill over across the region.
And he warned about the dire situation for civilians inside Gaza, calling again for humanitarian aid corridors into the territory.
Mr Lazzarini said he fears ""the world is now losing its humanity"".
In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Lazzarini reiterated calls for humanitarian aid corridors, saying help ""needs to be uninterrupted... predictable [and] meaningful"" to help the people of Gaza.
Speaking in Jerusalem, the head of UNRWA condemned Hamas's attack on Israel, calling it a ""horrific and barbaric massacre"" that had created a ""national trauma, a collective trauma in Israel"".
""But this event still does not justify that the war is conducted without any restraint,"" he said. ""And I do not believe that killing even more civilians is in the interest of the future security and peace here in the region.""
Asked if Israelis were respecting international humanitarian law, Mr Lazzarini said: ""Listen, we are now in a situation where there is a total siege being imposed in the Gaza Strip.
""We are in a situation where more than a million people have been asked to be displaced. So this amounts to collective punishment, and collective punishment is a violation of international humanitarian law.""
He added: ""We call to the Israelis and to anyone relevant in this conflict to respect international humanitarian law. There is no exception for anyone.""
Speaking about the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Mr Lazzarini said 2.2 million Palestinians, half of whom have been displaced, are ""basically lacking everything"".
""There is no water. You have four toilets for 4,000 people. They are living on the floor,"" he said. ""We are on the brink.""
""If there is no water anymore in the Gaza Strip, things will accelerate. And the disaster which is already unfolding under our eyes, will become even worse,"" Mr Lazzarini said.
The UN has previously warned of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" unless aid can get into Gaza.
Mr Lazzarini said that before Hamas's attack on 7 October, around 500 trucks a day would carry aid, fuel and other goods into the Strip.
Now, he said, it is unclear how much aid they need to send or what they will even be allowed to take in - but estimated the agency would need ""at least 100 trucks a day"" for Gazans.
On Wednesday,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmedthat his country would ""not thwart"" supplies going from Egypt to the civilian population in southern Gaza.
However, no aid has yet has crossed into the territory via the Rafah crossing from Egypt.
World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Thursday: ""Our trucks are loaded and ready to go."" He said supplies would be delivered as soon as the Rafah crossing opened - ""hopefully tomorrow"", he added.
Mr Lazzarini ended by saying that Palestinians are now feeling ""a deep sense and feeling of abandonment from the international community"" amid the ongoing violence.
""They feel completely empty. They all have families member who have been killed on a daily basis. They hear about the relatives. And at the same time, they have to care of their own survival.""
""But the feeling of abandonment should not be underestimated.""

Six Palestinians killed in Israeli military raid in Jenin,2023-06-20,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"Six Palestinians, including a 15-year-old boy, have been killed by Israeli forces during a raid into Jenin refugee camp, Palestinian health officials say.
An Israeli helicopter fired missiles after Palestinian militants targeted troop carriers with explosives.
It marks a sharp escalation of fighting as frequent raids in the city in the occupied West Bank continue.
The Israeli army said it had to mount a ""logistical operation under fire"" to remove several stranded vehicles.
Seven Israeli soldiers and border police officers were wounded, three of them ""moderately"", according to the army.
It is the first time in years - possibly since the height of the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, two decades ago - that the Israeli military has used attack helicopters in the West Bank. The helicopter reportedly fired at militants on the ground while Israeli forces tried to extract soldiers.
One resident told local media: ""We are unable to leave the house, it's a real war here. Apache helicopters are flying over our heads.""
""The helicopter bombed a field in our neighbourhood. Some people were injured and a water pipe was damaged, causing water outages in large parts of Jenin camp.""
The Palestinian Authority described the raid as ""Israeli aggression on Jenin [which] is a serious, dangerous escalation and must stop immediately"".
Over the past 18 months, Israel has intensified its military search, arrest and home demolition raids into Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank, amid a sharp rise in Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis - with casualty rates on both sides reaching levels not seen in many years.
Since the start of this year, at least 162 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while 21 Israelis have been killed.
Before dawn on Monday, undercover Israeli troops entered a neighbourhood on the edge of Jenin's packed urban refugee camp, targeting the family home of a militant jailed by Israel, eyewitnesses said.
""I looked out the window and saw masked soldiers storming the house of our neighbour, Assem Abu al-Haija. After about a quarter of an hour, I heard several explosions and heavy gunfire,"" Somaya Abu Samaan told Palestine TV.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described a ""massive exchange of fire"" between its forces and Palestinian gunmen.
Videos showed an explosion hitting armoured troop transport as shots rang out.
An Israeli military spokesman said a Panther troop carrier was hit by an ""unusual and dramatic"" improvised explosive device (IED), after which an Israeli Apache helicopter fired on an open area to repel the gunmen as forces extracted soldiers from the troop transport.
""We don't know the nature of the IED, it was pretty intense,"" Lt Col Richard Hecht said.
He said the IDF were now bringing in heavy machinery to try to extract the vehicles, while exchanges of fire with militants continued. He added that soldiers who were previously inside the carrier had been moved to other protected vehicles.
The Palestinian health ministry said five men and a 15-year-old boy, whom it named as Ahmed Yousef Saqr, were killed during the raid. The fifth man died of his wounds on Tuesday morning.
The ministry added that more than 90 Palestinians were wounded, including a 15-year-old girl who local reports said was hit by a bullet which came through the wall of her home.
A Palestinian photojournalist covering the raid, Hazem Imad Nasser, was also among those wounded. Palestinian medics said he underwent surgery after being shot in his side.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society, meanwhile, accused the Israeli army of stopping medical teams reaching casualties.
The society's director in Jenin, Dr Mahmoud al-Saadi, told the BBC: ""We are working in very difficult conditions. The occupation [Israeli] forces impeded the movement of ambulances and prevented medical staff from performing their duties.""
The raid is a further sign that US-led attempts to de-escalate tensions in the West Bank are failing.
Officials had hoped to reduce the intensity of Israeli military raids and impel the Palestinian Authority to regain its grip in the cities of Jenin and Nablus, where they have lost control to a new generation of militants.
Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority's civil affairs minister, said a ""fierce and open war is being waged against the Palestinian people... by the occupation forces"".
He called for the Palestinian leadership to take ""unprecedented decisions"" without elaborating.
Israel's use of aircraft would ""push our fighters to use tools that will surprise the enemy"", an official with the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said. It claimed two of the dead men as members.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: ""We will use all the tools at our disposal and strike terrorists wherever they may be. Terrorists will not find a safe haven - not in Jenin, not in Nablus, and not in Gaza.""
In a separate development, the United States said it was ""deeply troubled"" by new Israeli plans to expand Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and make changes that will see a hard-line pro-settler minister, Bezalel Smotrich, take authority over future planning there.
Mr Smotrich heads a far-right, religious ultranationalist bloc that has espoused racist, anti-Palestinian policies.
A senior Israeli official played down the move, saying it was part of measures to cut ""unnecessary administrative red tape in the construction authorisation process"".
The US state department said Israel's actions violated previous commitments it had made to the Biden administration, while Palestinian leaders condemned the new steps and called on the international community to intervene.
Settlements are seen as illegal under international law, but Israel disputes that.

Hamas blindsides Israel with most serious attack in a generation - Jeremy Bowen,2023-10-07,BBC,By Jeremy Bowen,"Israel was taken by surprise by the most ambitious operation Hamas has ever launched from Gaza.
The scale of what's been happening is unprecedented. Hamas breached the wire that separates Gaza from Israel in multiple places in the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.
It came a day after the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria in 1973 that started a major Middle East war. The significance of the date will not have been lost on the Hamas leadership.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is at war and will exact a heavy price from its enemies.
Videos and photos of dead Israelis, civilians as well as soldiers, are all over social media.
Other videos of armed men from Hamas hauling soldiers and civilians into captivity in Gaza have enraged and alarmed Israelis.
Within hours Israel was responding with air strikes into Gaza, killing many Palestinians. Its generals will be planning a ground operation next.
The presence of Israeli hostages there means it will be even more complicated than previous incursions.
For months, it has been clear that there was a deepening risk of an explosion between Palestinian armed groups and Israel. How and where it happened was a total surprise, outside the armed wing of Hamas.
Israelis and Palestinians have been focusing on the West Bank, the territory between Jerusalem and the Jordanian border that Israel has occupied since 1967, where there has been almost continuous confrontation and violence throughout the year.
Armed Palestinians, especially those operating out of the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus, have attacked Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers.
The Israeli army has mounted dozens of raids. Armed settlers have taken the law into their own hands, with reprisals against Palestinian villages.
Extreme religious nationalists inside Israel's right-wing government have repeated their claim that the occupied territories, in their entirety, are Jewish land.
No one expected Hamas to conceive and meticulously plan such a complex and coordinated operation out of Gaza.
Recriminations have already started in Israel about the failure of its intelligence services to see what was coming. Israelis expect that an extensive network of informers, agents and high-tech surveillance will do its job.
In the end, Israeli intelligence was blindsided by the Hamas operation, which came when Israelis were relaxing or praying during the weekend of a religious holiday.
Hamas has said it acted because of threats to Jerusalem's mosques. During the last week, some Jews have prayed inside the Aqsa Mosque compound, the third holiest place for Muslims after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
The same precinct is also venerated by Jews, as it was the site of the biblical Jewish temple. Prayer by religious Jews on what they call the Temple Mount might not sound like much, but it is prohibited by Israel as Palestinians consider it highly provocative.
Even so, by the standards of Jerusalem, always a tinderbox of national and religious conflict, it was not exceptionally tense.
The complexity of the Hamas operation shows that it had been planned over months. It was not a hasty response to events in Jerusalem in the last week or so.
The reasons why Hamas and Israel are once again at war run much deeper. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has been heating up even when it is far from the headlines of international news organisations.
Even so, it has been largely ignored by countries that still officially call for peace via a two-state solution, shorthand for an independent Palestine alongside Israel. For a while, during the Oslo peace process of the 1990s, the prospect of two states was a real hope. Now it is an empty slogan.
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has not been a priority for President Joe Biden's administration in Washington DC. It has been trying to find a way to offer security guarantees to Saudi Arabia in return for a rapprochement with Israel.
The last American attempt to relaunch a peace process failed a decade ago, during the administration of President Barack Obama.
At the heart of the trouble is the intractable and unresolved century-long conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the river Jordan. These rapidly-escalating events prove once again that the conflict cannot simply be managed. When it is left to fester, violence and bloodshed are guaranteed.

Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi freed by Israel,,BBC,By Sam Hancock &  Lou Newton,"Activist Ahed Tamimi was one of 30 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel on Wednesday, as part of the truce deal with Hamas.
Israel's prison service said a mixture of men and women had been freed ""from a number of [its] facilities"".
Ms Tamimi, 22, was arrested earlier this month over an Instagram post, which her family say she did not write.
As of Wednesday night, 102 hostages have been freed, while 210 Palestinian prisoners have been released.
Images showed Ms Tamimi, who had been held in Damon Prison, near the Israeli city of Haifa, returned to the West Bank late on Wednesday.
The prominent activist was pictured having an emotional reunion with her mother.
Other prisoners, whose names have not yet been shared, were also seen reuniting with family members.
The social media post Ms Tamimi was detained over is no longer visible online, nor is the account it came from, which carried her name and photo.
Israeli media reported that she had threatened to ""slaughter"" Jewish settlers, but her mother said the account did not belong to her daughter.
""There are dozens of [online] pages in Ahed's name with her photo, with which she has no connection,"" she told AFP news agency at the time of her arrest.
Israel's military told AFP she was arrested on suspicion of ""inciting violence and terrorist activities"".
As a teenager, Ms Tamimi became a symbol of resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank.
When she was 14 years old she was photographed biting an Israeli soldier who was trying to detain her younger brother.
Two years later, she wasfilmed slapping and kicking an Israeli soldierin an altercation outside her home and was subsequently arrested and sentenced to eight months in prison.
Her father, Bassem Tamimi, is an activist who used to regularly organise protests against the Israeli occupation and has been repeatedly jailed.
Ms Tamimi is one of hundreds of Palestinians who have been arrested in the West Bank since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen from Gaza attacked southern Israel.
Israel says the arrests have been made to limit violence during a time when unrest has surged in the West Bank.
On Thursday,three Israelis were killedwhen two Hamas gunmen opened fire at a crowded bus stop in West Jerusalem during morning rush hour.
The two attackers had come from occupied East Jerusalem.
Sixteen Israelis were injured and the attackers were killed by police and an armed civilian.
Earlier on Wednesday,two Palestinian boys, aged eight and 14,were shot and killed during a raid by the Israeli army in the West Bank city of Jenin.
The Israeli military said explosive devices were thrown at its soldiers and that they responded with live fire.

Palestinian families return to rubble in Jenin refugee camp,,BBC,By Eman Eriqat & Alaa Daraghmeh,"""We had to flee. Or my daughters and I would have been killed,"" Fatina al-Ghoul says, weeping as she looks back at a pile of rubble that was once her home.
A bulldozer has already arrived and is clearing up debris from her street, which has been left in ruins.
She and nine other women, her family and neighbours, fled their homes in Jenin's refugee camp during one of the largest Israeli operations in the occupied West Bank in years.
Fatina's family is one of hundreds now returning to what's left of their homes, decimated by drone strikes and fighting between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and armed Palestinians.
The IDF described it as a ""counter-terrorism operation"", saying they were targeting weapons stores and manufacturing facilities belonging to militant groups in the area.
But the Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the operation as ""open war against the people of Jenin"".
Hundreds of Israeli troops backed by drone strikes entered Jenin refugee camp - where almost 24,000 people live in an area of less than half a square kilometre - on Monday morning, triggering intense gun battles with armed Palestinians inside.
Palestinian health officials said 12 Palestinians were killed over the next two days, including four children, and that more than 100 others were injured. The Israeli military said one of its soldiers was killed as its forces started to withdraw on Tuesday night.
""My house has been completely destroyed. Everything is broken and burned. It's all damaged,"" Fatina says.
Several local hospitals also told the BBC that they were struggling to cope with the fallout from the fighting.
Thousands of locals also took to the streets on Wednesday for the funerals of those killed. So far, it has been confirmed to the BBC that eight of the dead were members of the military wings of the main Palestinian factions.
Guns were fired in support of the deceased fighters.
Many residents say they blame the Palestinian Authority (PA), the main governing body of the Palestinians in the West Bank, for not protecting them during the operation.
Videos circulating online showed two PA representatives forced to leave a funeral after being chastised by the crowd.
Residents complained that at the beginning of the operation the PA's security forces simply allowed the Israeli military vehicles to enter the city.
Fatina says she also blames the PA for their lack of action. ""This is our home. We are living in fear, and we are the only ones left to protect it.""
""There are agreements between the PA and Israel. The PA has not broken the agreement and security services have done their job during the military operation according to what it was asked to do by the Palestinian leadership,"" Mayor of Jenin City and PA member Akram Rajoub told the BBC.
One fighter from a Palestinian militant group said that Israeli forces had successful destroyed several of its facilities, including a storage unit containing explosives.
However, the scale of the operation inside a densely populated city and refugee camp was criticised by the UN's human rights chief.
For many residents like Fatina, immediate access to drinking water, food and shelter is now critical.
""Tonight we will sleep on the streets. We can't even sit down inside the house. There is nowhere else to go, for us or any of our neighbours.""

Israel-Gaza: Why this war is different to the others,2023-11-13,BBC,By Jeremy Bowen,"If this Gaza war was like all the others, a ceasefire would probably have been in force by now.
The dead would be buried and Israel would be arguing with the United Nations about how much cement could come into Gaza for rebuilding.
But this war is not like that. It is not just because of the enormity of the killing, first by Hamas on 7 October, mostly of Israeli civilians, followed by Israel's ""mighty vengeance"" as its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it, which has mostly killed Palestinian civilians.
This war is different to the others because it comes at a time when the fault lines that divide the Middle East are rumbling. For at least two decades, the most serious rift in the region's fractured geopolitical landscape has been between the friends and allies of Iran, and the friends and allies of the United States.
The core of Iran's network, sometimes called the ""axis of resistance"", is made up of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen and assorted Iraqi militias that are armed and trained by Iran. The Iranians have also supported Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.
Iran is also getting closer to Russia and China. Iran has become a significant part of Russia's war effort in Ukraine. China buys a great deal of Iranian oil.
The longer the war in Gaza goes on, and as Israel kills more Palestinian civilians and destroys tens of thousands of homes, the greater the risk of conflict involving some members of those two camps.
The border between Israel and Lebanon is heating up, slowly and steadily. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah want a full-scale war. But as they trade increasingly heavy punches, the risks of uncontrolled escalation will grow.
The Houthis in Yemen have been launching missiles and drones towards Israel. They have all been brought down, so far, by Israel's air defences or by US Navy warships in the Red Sea.
In Iraq, militias supported by Iran have attacked American bases. The US retaliated at some of their sites in Syria. Again, all sides are trying to limit escalation, but controlling the tempo of military action is always difficult.
On America's side are Israel, the Gulf oil states, Jordan and Egypt. The US continues to give strong support to Israel, even though it is clear that President Joe Biden is uncomfortable about the way Israel is killing so many Palestinian civilians. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said publicly that too many Palestinian civilians are being killed.
America's Arab allies have all condemned what Israel is doing and called for a ceasefire. The sight of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fleeing their homes in northern Gaza and walking down the main road south raises the ghosts of Israel's victory over the Arabs in its independence war in 1948.
More than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes at gunpoint by the Israelis, events referred to by Palestinians as al Nakba - the catastrophe. The descendants of the 1948 refugees include much of the population of the Gaza Strip.
Dangerous talk by some of the extreme Jewish nationalists who are supporting the government of Benjamin Netanyahu about imposing another Nakba on Palestinians is alarming Arab states in America's camp, particularly Jordan and Egypt. One minister in Netanyahu's government even mused about dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza to deal with Hamas. He was reprimanded but not sacked.
All that can be dismissed as the ravings of the lunatic fringe, but it is being taken seriously in Jordan and Egypt. Not nuclear weapons, of which Israel has a large and undeclared arsenal, but the prospect of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians being forced over their borders.
As for the war itself in Gaza, senior western diplomats from countries that are firm allies of Israel's allies, told the BBC that ending the war, and dealing with the aftermath will be ""difficult and messy"".
One said that ""the only way through will be rebuilding a political horizon for Palestinians"". That was a reference to an independent Palestine alongside Israel, the so called two-state solution, a failed idea that survives only as a slogan.
Reviving it, perhaps in the context of a wider accommodation between Israel and the Arabs, is an ambitious plan, and perhaps the best idea around. But in the current atmosphere of pain, alarm and hatred it will be very difficult to deliver.
It won't happen under the current leaderships of both Palestinians and Israelis.
Prime Minister Netanyahu has not revealed his plan for the day after the fighting ends in Gaza, but he has rejected America's idea of installing a government led by the Palestinian Authority, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas and ejected by Hamas from Gaza in 2007.
The second part of the American plan is for negotiations on a two-state solution, something that Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed throughout his political life.
Not only is Mr Netanyahu against independence for the Palestinians. His survival as prime minister depends on support from Jewish extremists who believe the entire territory between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean was given to the Jewish people by God and should all be inside Israel's borders.
Many Israelis want him out, blaming him for the security and intelligence failures that allowed the attacks of 7 October to happen.
The Palestinian President Abbas is in his late 80s and is discredited in the eyes of potential voters, though he has not subjected himself to the ballot box since 2005. The Palestinian Authority cooperates with Israel on security in the West Bank but cannot protect its own people from armed Jewish settlers.
Leaderships change, eventually. If this terrible war in Gaza doesn't force the Israelis, Palestinians and their powerful friends to try again to make peace, then the only future is more war.

Gaza strikes: Hamas-run health ministry says 700 killed in 24 hours,,BBC,By David Gritten,"More than 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, the Hamas-run health ministry says.
Israel's military said it struck 400 ""terror targets"" and killed several Hamas commanders over the same period.
It also declared that it would not reduce its attacks despite Hamas's release of another two hostages.
UN aid agencies meanwhile pleaded for sustained and safe humanitarian access, warning they were ""on their knees"".
A third of hospitals in Gaza are no longer functioning due to shortages of electricity, medicine and staff, and the shortage of clean water is now critical.
Israel launched its bombing campaign against Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and other powers class as a terrorist organisation - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 222 others were taken hostage.
Nearly 5,800 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the health ministry.
Intense Israeli air strikes overnight hit hundreds of locations across Gaza.
Some of those killed in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah were displaced people who had fled the north in response to an Israeli military order to evacuate the area for their own safety, local officials said.
They included 13 members of one family from Gaza City, who had been staying in a residential building in Qarara, on the north-eastern outskirts of Khan Younis, where the population has swelled from 400,000 to 1.2 million.
A relative who survived said: ""We were sleeping and suddenly a big explosion happened. All of my family are dead.""
The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf says there was grief, shock and anger at the city's hospital on Tuesday morning, as bodies were brought out of the mortuary and taken away for burial. Mourners said there was ""no safe place"" in Gaza.
Later, about 20 people were reportedly killed in a strike on a residential building in the heavily-populated Amal area of Khan Younis.
The Hamas-run health ministry said it had been the deadliest 24 hours of the war so far, with 704 people reported killed, including 305 children, 173 women and 78 elderly people. That brought the overall death toll in Gaza to 5,791, it added.
The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, said on Tuesday morning that its jets struck ""dozens of terror infrastructure and Hamas staging grounds"" in several northern areas in and around Gaza City, as well as a ""Hamas operational tunnel shaft"" near the Mediterranean coastline.
It added that aircraft also targeted Hamas command centres and staging grounds located in mosques, killing the deputy commanders of three battalions of Hamas's military wing, and also struck dozens of Hamas gunmen setting up to fire rockets towards Israel.
""We want to bring Hamas to a state of full dismantling - its leaders, its military branch, and its working mechanisms,"" IDF Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi told commanders on Monday. ""The path is a path of unrelenting attacks, damaging Hamas everywhere and in every way.""
He also said that Israeli troops massing near the Gaza perimeter fence were ""well prepared for the ground operations"" - a reference to the invasion expected soon.
The general spoke before Hamas released two elderly Israeli women -Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and Nurit Cooper, 79- who were taken as hostages from the Nir Oz kibbutz close to Gaza on 7 October. Others living there were killed and the women's husbands remain among those being held.
Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is growing more and more desperate, with shortages of food, water and shelter for the 1.4 million people who have fled their homes.
The health ministry warned the territory's healthcare system could collapse and 12 of the 32 hospitals in Gaza were out of service. The others were running out of fuel and only running the most essential services.
A spokeswoman the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza, warned that it had also almost exhausted its fuel stocks.
""If we do not get fuel urgently, we will be forced to halt our operations in the Gaza Strip as of Wednesday night,"" Juliette Touma told the BBC.
At a briefing in Geneva, UNRWA said just 54 lorries of aid had been allowed to cross through the Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing since 21 October. Before that, Gaza had been receiving around 500 lorries a day.
Access once the limited supplies are allowed in is also challenging.
The UN has not received the necessary security guarantees to allow aid to be delivered across Gaza, including to the north, where thousands of people, some of them severely injured, remain despite Israel's evacuation order.
The World Health Organization warned that while some medical supplies had been allowed in they were not enough to meet the needs. Medical personnel standing by in Egypt have also not been allowed to accompany the supplies.
The WHO stressed that fuel, which has so far not been allowed in, was essential for desalination plants, bakeries and hospitals.
The shortage of clean water is now critical, as people only have access to between 1 and 3 litres (34-101 fl oz) of water per day. The basic minimum is 15 litres per day, according to the WHO.
The World Food Programme said it had reduced food rations in an effort to ensure it was reaching as many people as possible.
Emad Abuaassi, who moved from Blackpool in England to northern Gaza with his wife and four children 10 months ago, told the BBC in a voice note that they were now living in a two-bedroom flat in Khan Youniswith about 50 other people.
""We're struggling for everything. We've just managed to have half a sandwich - me and my kids this morning,"" he said. ""The queue is half a mile for a bag of bread.""
""I don't know what's going to happen in the next two or three days.""
Israel has agreed to limited deliveries of aid other than fuel, saying that could be stolen and exploited by Hamas for military purposes.
An IDF spokesman posted a satellite photo showing 12 fuel tanks near Rafah which he said contained hundreds of thousands of litres of diesel belonging to Hamas. He alleged that the group ""steals the diesel from the civilians and transfers it to tunnels, [rocket] launchers and senior officials"".
Writing on X (formerly known as Twitter) the Israeli military told UNRWA: ""Ask Hamas if you can have some.""

"Boy, 14, and freelance reporter among Palestinians freed",2023-11-28,BBC,By Laura Gozzi,"Thirty Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Tuesday night as part of the truce deal with Hamas.
They include ""15 minors and 15 women"", a spokesman for Qatar's foreign ministry said.
Among those released are Marwat al-Azza, a freelance journalist who had previously worked with US broadcaster NBC, and a 14-year-old boy.
They were freed as 10 Israeli and two foreign hostages were released by Hamas in Gaza.
The Israeli prison service said the prisoners had been released from Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank and the Jerusalem Detention Center.
Tuesday was the fifth day of the truce between Israel and Hamas, after a 48-hour extension was agreed yesterday.
Ms al-Azza, 45, was arrested earlier this month in East Jerusalem on suspicion of inciting terrorism and identifying with a terrorist organisation in relation to social media posts she made about Hamas's attack on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 Israelis.
NBC cut ties with her following her arrest.
Another prisoner released by Israel was named by Al Jazeera as Ahmed Salayme, 14. Last May, UK-based website Middle East Eye reported that the teenager was arrested on charges of throwing stones in East Jerusalem.
In an interview upon his release, he told Al Jazeera that Israeli prison officers carried out ""a number of beatings"" including on female inmates, on the day the war started on 7 October.
He added that he was told not to celebrate his release: ""I'm not allowed to leave my house, raise any signs or banners, use a megaphone. And if I break any of these rules I will be taken back,"" he said.
His mother told Al Jazeera Israeli authorities had searched the family home several times ahead of her son's release and said she was afraid her son could be rearrested at any moment.
Reuters news agency showed images of Palestinians cheering just outside Ofer prison at the Beitunia checkpoint as the new batch of prisoners were driven past on buses marked with the the International Red Cross sign.
Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has banned Palestinians from celebrating the prisoners' release, according to Israeli media.
""My instructions are clear: there are to be no expressions of joy. Expressions of joy are equivalent to backing terrorism,"" Mr Ben Gvir was quoted as saying.
Since Friday, a total of 180 Palestinians - mostly women and teenage boys - have been released from Israeli jails as part of the truce.
They were chosen from an original list of 300 Palestinians compiled by Israel and had been accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to incitement to attempted murder.
Fewer than a quarter of those on the list had been convicted - the vast majority were being held on remand while awaiting trial.
Under the terms of the truce, three Palestinians are being freed in exchange for each Israeli hostage returned from Gaza.

Netanyahu says Israel 'not successful' at minimising Gaza casualties but blames Hamas,2023-11-17,BBC,,"Israel's prime minister has said it is trying to minimise civilian casualties in the war in Gaza but has been ""not successful"", blaming this on Hamas.
In an interview with CBS News, Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was firing at Palestinians trying to get safety.
Hamas ""don't give a hoot about the Palestinians"", he said.
More than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza, Hamas's health ministry says, since Israel went to war after Hamas's deadly attack on 7 October.
Some 1,200 people were killed and about 240 were taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities and military bases.
Several of the missing people have since been confirmed dead, with Hamas blaming Israeli air strikes, although the claim cannot be independently verified.
Mr Netanyahu told the BBC's US partner CBS that Israel would ""try to finish the job"" of wiping out Hamas in Gaza with minimal civilian casualties.
He said: ""That's what we're trying to do: minimal civilian casualties. But unfortunately, we're not successful.""
Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli military dropped leaflets urging people to leave certain areas and called civilians on their mobile phones warning them to leave but claimed Hamas was preventing this ""at gun point"".
""Any civilian death is a tragedy. And we shouldn't have any because we're doing everything we can to get the civilians out of harm's way, while Hamas is doing everything to keep them in harm's way,"" he said.
He added Hamas had ""fired at the safe corridors that we provided for the Palestinians"".
Addressing Israel's military raids on Al-Shifa hospital - the biggest medical facility in Gaza - Mr Netanyahu said there were ""strong indications"" that Israeli hostages were being held there and this was ""one of the reasons we entered"".
He said there were no hostages at the hospital when forces entered the hospital on Wednesday, claiming: ""If there were [hostages], they were taken out.""
Israel said it has further intelligence about those being held, but Mr Netanyahu said ""the less I say about it, the better"".
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of housing a major base underneath Al-Shifa - something which Hamas and hospital authorities have always denied.
Mr Netanyahu did not elaborate on what information Israel had to suggest that hostages had been held at Al-Shifa.
But he said Israel had ""concrete evidence"" that there were ""terrorist chieftains and terrorists"" in the hospital who he said had fled as Israel's forces entered.
""Hamas was using the patients in that hospital as a human shield,"" he said.
Mr Netanyahu said Israel had warned the hospital authorities it was going to enter the facility and to move patients out of the way, adding they were ""doing this very gingerly"" because they were trying to ""do the moral thing"".
Israel's military said its soldiers had found the bodies of two hostages -65-year-old Yehudit Weissand 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the vicinity of the hospital.

Israel says CCTV footage shows hostages were taken to Gaza hospital,2023-11-19,BBC,By Nick Beake,"The Israeli military has released footage which it says shows hostages being taken into Gaza's largest hospital after the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October.
A military spokesman said one of them - a soldier - was murdered there.
Cpl Noa Marciano, 19, was killed after being taken into al-Shifa hospital with minor injuries, he said.
Israel said a tunnel had been found at the site which it claims was a Hamas command centre. Hamas denies that.
The BBC has not been able to verify the video which was presented at a news briefing by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday.
""This morning we updated Noa's family that according to our findings, she was kidnapped to a safe house near Shifa,"" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, IDF chief spokesperson told reporters.
""During IDF air strikes in the area, the Hamas terrorist who was holding Noa was killed and she was wounded in the air strike, but not a life-threatening injury. Noa was taken inside Shifa hospital, where she was murdered by another Hamas terrorist.""
Hamas has previously claimed Ms Marciano was killed in an Israeli air strike, which the IDF said occurred on 9 November.
Rear Adm Hagari then played CCTV footage which he said was from the morning of 7 October - the day Hamas launched its surprise attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 240 taken hostage.
The video showed two hostages being brought into the hospital, Gaza's largest and most modern.
Armed men can be seen in the CCTV video which is date-stamped 7 October. One of the hostages appears to be resisting - the other is shown on a stretcher.
The IDF has been under pressure to substantiate its claim that Hamas operated an expansive command centre underneath the vast medical complex in the north of the territory.
Responding to the video released by Israel, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said it was not able to confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The ministry also said it was Israel which bore full responsibility for the deterioration and collapse of health services in Gaza.
Earlier, the IDF released a video that it said showed a tunnel 10m (33ft) below ground that runs for 55m up to a closed and reinforced door.
It said this was now part of the evidence that ""clearly proves"" numerous buildings in the hospital's complex have been ""used by Hamas as cover for terrorist infrastructure and activities"".
The latest video is not yet the evidence that's been promised of the sort of vast and intricate operation depicted in a computer simulation which the IDF previously released showing what it believes any Hamas base underground at al-Shifa could look like.
The US has said it also has intelligence that Hamas has used hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including al-Shifa, as command centres and weapons stores.
Israel has cited US intelligence to substantiate their claim of the existence of a major headquarters at the complex but the Americans' use of the term ""node"" may suggest a smaller operation.
Israel believes it is building a credible case and is keen to present evidence as and when it finds it.
While Israel's allies have supported its military campaign of retaliation, which it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, they have expressed a lot of unease at the toll that the offensive is having on civilians.
The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 people are feared to be buried under rubble.
The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also under pressure from families of the hostages. They want him to do more to free those held by Hamas.
On Saturday, protesters calling on the Israeli government to prioritise securing the release of hostages walked from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem before holding a demonstration outside Mr Netanyahu's residence.
The prime minister, however, appears undeterred in his mission.
He says his first goal of the war is to destroy Hamas; the second to return the hostages; and the third to eliminate the threat from Gaza.

Thousands join pro-Palestinian march in Birmingham,2023-10-15,BBC,By Susie Rack,"Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters have taken to the streets across Birmingham.
Crowds met on the city's High Street at 14:00 BST before marching towards Centenary Square.
It followed several pro-Palestinian demonstrations heldin cities across the UK, including London and Coventry on Saturday.
Crowds held Palestinian flags and chanted in response to speakers outside Birmingham's Town Hall.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, with its fighters entering communities near the Gaza Strip, killing at least 1,300 people, and taking scores of hostages.More than 2,300 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes.
Israel has warned 1.1m people in northern Gaza to evacuate before an expected ground invasion.
West Midlands Police said it would respond to any demonstrations appropriately and ""balance the right to protest against any disruption to communities"".
Assistant Chief Constable Claire Bell added: ""Behaviour that crosses the line into criminality will not be tolerated and equally we will take the strongest action against perpetrators of hate crime.""
The force said it extended its support to all communities in the West Midlands affected by the conflict.

Israel's new Gaza evacuation zones leave Palestinians few places to go,,BBC,By David Gritten,"Aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are running out of places to flee to, after the Israeli military first ordered tens of thousands to evacuate part of the main city in the south ahead of an assault by tanks and troops.
A map posted on social media on Monday told people in northern and central Khan Younisto leave immediatelyto ""preserve your safety and security"". Arrows directed them to move to three already overcrowded areas to the south and west.
On Tuesday however, the Israeli military said its forces had already entered the city and it was now too dangerous to leave.
""Don't get out. Going out is dangerous. You have been warned,"" new leaflets said, warning people to stay inside designated shelters and hospitals.
The evacuation of specific areas marked on online maps is part of a new approach the military says it is taking to avoid civilian casualties in its eight-week war with Hamas, following heavy pressure from the United States.
But there is concern that the strategy is too complicated, too dependent on technology, and too likely to cause panic to be a workable solution.
BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, said he had spoken to relatives and other people in the affected areas who were not aware of the IDF's map or could not see it because of patchy internet access and no regular supply of electricity.
""This is a joke, not a map, because we don't know where to go,"" a displaced person who was sheltering in Khan Younis told him.
There is also no guarantee they will be safe from bombardment if they flee.
The main Palestinian telecommunications firm meanwhile said that all phone and internet services were cut once again.
Before a temporary truce collapsed last Friday, the Israeli ground operation was focused on the north of Gaza.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a blanket order to all 1.1 million people living there to move south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.
Hundreds of thousands heeded the call as Israeli troops penetrated deep into Gaza City - with many of them eventually ending up in Khan Younis.
The IDF alsorepeatedly urged civiliansacross Gaza to move to al-Mawasi, a thin strip of territory along the Mediterranean coast which officials described as a ""humanitarian zone"".
During a visit to Israel on Thursday while the fighting was paused, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saidhe had told Israeli leadersthat they had to ""put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimize further casualties of innocent Palestinians"".
These included ""clearly and precisely designating areas and places in southern and central Gaza where they can be safe and out of the line of fire"", he added.
The IDF's response was to publish on its Arabic-language website on Friday an""Evacuation Zone Map""that divided Gaza into more than 600 numbered blocks, ranging in size from about 0.03 to 25 sq km (0.001 to 9.6 sq miles).
Jets also dropped leaflets with QR codes, allowing people with a working smartphone and an internet connection to access the map - and also asking them to share their location.
Asked about this approach on Monday, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said it had ""seen improvements"".
""We have seen them evacuate specific neighbourhoods, rather than entire areas, so the number of displaced persons will hopefully be lower in southern Gaza than it was in the north,"" he added.
However the IDF's order for civilians to move from Khan Younis to Rafah was condemned by the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which runs the biggest humanitarian operation in Gaza and has 958,000 displaced people sheltering at 99 facilities in the south.
""The order created panic, fear and anxiety,"" warned Philippe Lazzarini on Monday evening. ""At least an additional 60,000 people were forced to move to already overcrowded Unrwa shelters, with more asking to be sheltered.""
""The evacuation order pushes people to concentrate into what is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip,"" he added.
Mr Lazzarini also stressed that ""no place is safe in Gaza, whether in the south, or the south-west, whether in Rafah or in any unilaterally called 'safe zone'"".
Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was recently in Gaza, told the BBC on Tuesday that the idea of a ""safe zone"" was a ""dangerous false narrative"".
He said that under international law Israel had to ensure places of evacuation had conditions for people to survive.
In an apparent reference to al-Mawasi, he added: ""These are tiny patches of barren land. They have no water, no facilities, no shelter from the cold, no sanitation.""
A senior adviser to Israel's prime minister rejected such criticism in a BBC interview on Monday.
""I don't believe that nowhere is safe,"" Mark Regev said. ""We've designated safer zones for people to go to. If you believe the Hamas propaganda, we're just hitting innocent buildings, right? But if we're hitting a structure, it's because there's Hamas either in or under the structure.""
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 70% of the almost 15,900 people killed there since the start of the conflict have been women and children.
Israel launched a military campaign in response to a cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - including many women and children - were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.

Gaza: Belfast-born man confirms his two children will be evacuated,2023-11-16,BBC,,"A Belfast-born man whosewife and other family members were killed in Gazahas told BBC News NI of his happiness after learning that his children will leave the Palestinian territory.
Khalid El-Estal, 30, had appealed for help reuniting with his children after the loss of his family members.
His four-year-old son Ali and one-year-old daughter Sara are now included on an evacuation list to leave Gaza.
They are due to enter Egypt via the Rafah crossing in the next day.
The children are currently situated at the crossing and will travel to Ireland with his brother-in-law, he added.
""You can't imagine how I felt, I was very happy and excited about that... I was thinking 'what should I bring for the kids?'
""I hope they will make it, if not today then please tomorrow,"" he said. ""They have a good chance [in Ireland].""
Mr El-Estal was born in Belfast and attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University.
When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where he met his wife, Ashwak Jendia, at university.
He told BBC News NI it was a ""very long love story"" with his ""beautiful, talented"" wife.
Israel began striking Gaza after Hamas's 7 October attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 hostages were taken.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 11,500 people have been killed in the territory since 7 October - of whom more than 4,500 were children.
Mr El-Estal was working in Saudi Arabia when his wife was killed along with his mother, brother, uncle and two cousins.
""Everything was going in the right path, we were expecting to come [to Ireland] together,"" he said of his wife. ""Years of love, happiness... all of it is gone.""
Mr El Estal said he is now worried for his father and brothers who remain in the Gaza Strip.
""My brothers are Irish citizens, they didn't want to come to Ireland because they [didn't] want to leave my father and mother, but now it's different.
""I'm really hoping they can figure something for my father, because he's not Irish, to join me here... I can't imagine leaving my father alone.
""How can he face all of this, and I am his eldest son? I should be with him.""
On Wednesday, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said 23 Irish citizens had crossed into Egypt from Gaza.
He said it was ""very welcome news"" that some families with children had successfully crossed the Rafah checkpoint.
Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ, Mr Martin said there is another group of about 40 Irish citizens and dependents due to leave the war zone.
On Thursday, the tánaiste travelled to southern Israel, following a visit to Egypt on Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters, Mr Martin said three more Irish citizens have managed to cross into Egypt today, which is a lower number than hoped for, due to ""processing delays"".
He also said the Israeli foreign minister, Eli Cohen, has assured him that the majority of Irish citizens remaining in Gaza will be able to exit within the next three days.
On Wednesday evening, a motion which called for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador to Ireland wasrejected in the the Dáil (Irish lower house of parliament).
Meanwhile, in the UK Parliament, MPs voted to reject a call for an immediate ceasefire.
Among the Northern Ireland's MPs, the SDLP and Alliance voted in favour and four DUP MPs who were present in the chamber voted against the move.
The DUP also voted against a separate Labour amendment which stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.

Israel condemns EU envoy's Gaza paragliding flight,,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israel has condemned the EU's outgoing envoy to the Palestinians after he paraglided over Gaza's coast to draw attention to the blockade of the strip.
A video showed Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff declaring he had carried out ""the first Gaza paragliding flight in history"".
""Once you have a free Palestine, a free Gaza, you can do exactly the same thing,"" the German diplomat adds.
Israel's foreign ministry said it was a ""provocative action"" that served as propaganda for militant groups in Gaza.
""The European diplomat forgot a long time ago that he represents the European Union and its member states,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.
""[He] continues to represent the Palestinian narrative and to be a propaganda tool in the hands of the terrorist organisations that control Gaza.""
A spokesperson for the EU delegation to the Palestinians told Reuters news agency on Tuesday that the paraglider belonged to Mr Kühn von Burgsdorff and that Israeli authorities were not informed in advance of ""the purely local and sport activity"".
The envoy also went kayaking in the Mediterranean during his two-day visit at the end of his mission in the region.
About 2.1 million people live in Gaza, which is only 40km (25 miles) long and up to 11km wide.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas - designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the EU and other powers - took full control of the territory in 2007. It ousted Palestinian Authority security forces in days of bloody fighting, a year after it won the Palestinians' last parliamentary election.
Following the takeover, Israel and Egypt imposed a land, sea and air blockade on Gaza, restricting the movement of goods and people. The two countries say the blockade is for self-defence.
However, the blockade has crippled Gaza's economy and living conditions are dire. Human rights groups say it constitutes a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of international humanitarian law.

What we know about Israeli hostages taken by Hamas,,BBC,By Alys Davies,"A ""significant number"" of Israeli civilians and soldiers are being held hostage by Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military says.
Some are alive and some are presumed dead, military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said.
Children, women, the elderly and the disabled were among those taken, he added.
""These are numbers that were up until now unimaginable,"" he said. ""This will shape the future of this war.""
According to Hamas, the number of Israelis captured was ""several times greater"" than dozens, and they had been taken to locations throughout the Gaza Strip.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was responsible for their wellbeing and Israel would ""settle the score with anyone who harms them"".
There are numerous videos circulating online purporting to show Israelis in the hands of Hamas fighters.
One video, that has been verified by the BBC, shows a truck being driven through crowds on the Gaza Strip, purportedly carrying Israeli hostages.
Another video which has been geo-located to the Gaza Strip, shows a barefooted woman being dragged from the back of a truck with bloodied hands tied behind her back.
Some hostages are said to have been taken from an outdoor party in Kibbutz Re'im, a suburb in the city of Ofakim in Israel's south - not far from Gaza.
Witnesses told Israeli media that attackers on motorcycles began firing at attendees, many of whom are still missing.
Videos posted on social media, which have not been verified by the BBC, appear to show one woman who attended the party being kidnapped and held on a motorcycle by two men.
She was identified by her partner's brother Moshe Or as an Israeli woman called Noa Argamani.
Mr Or had reported her missing, before seeing her and his brother in the videos, both held by several militants.
""I saw Noa in the video scared and frightened, I can't imagine what's going through her mind at all - screaming in panic on a motorcycle,"" he said in an interview with Israeli broadcaster Channel 12.
A later video - also not verified by the BBC - appears to show her sipping water in a room in Gaza.
Outside the Gaza Strip, Israeli military forces have reportedly freed Israeli civilians who were being held hostage in two locations in the south.
In Kibbutz Be'eri, hostages who were being held in a dining room were rescued after 18 hours, Israel's TV channels reported.
Israeli media reports suggested that up to 50 people had been held there.
Speaking to Reuters news agency, a woman identified as Ella said she had been barricaded in a bomb shelter for hours in the town.
""We can hear a lot of gunfire, we were told that terrorists are in the dining hall, we can hear a lot of shooting,"" she said.
""I've lost contact with my family. I know my father has been kidnapped... no one is telling us what's going on. I don't know if my mother is alive.""
A video verified by the BBC shows militants in Be'eri leading barefooted people along a street. It is unclear if they were the same hostages as those held in the dining hall.
Meanwhile, in Kibbutz Urim, a suburb in the city of Ofakim, two Israelis were rescued after being taken hostage by Hamas militants in a house for hours on Saturday, according to Israel's public broadcaster Kan.
Gunmen had entered the city and opened fire on residents as they fled to bomb shelters after rocket alarms were set off in the city, Israeli media reported.
The two residents had stayed in their apartment, where four militants then took them hostage. The militants were later killed by Israeli forces.
Three Israeli soldiers were injured during the rescue, Kan said.

BA plane U-turns from Tel Aviv after flights are suspended,2023-10-11,BBC,By Tom Espiner,"British Airways has suspended flights to Israel after turning back one of its planes shortly before landing, due to security concerns.
Flight BA165 has returned to Heathrow after nearly reaching Tel Aviv on Wednesday, BA said.
A spokesperson for Israel's airports authority said rockets were flying around Tel Aviv at the time but were not an immediate threat to the flight.
Virgin Atlantic also suspended flights to the city on Wednesday.
A BA spokesman said safety was the airline's ""highest priority"".
As flight BA165 was approaching Tel Aviv, air raid sirens went off in the city. British Airways teams were made aware of this and asked the captain to turn around and return to the UK.
""Following the latest assessment of the situation, we're suspending our flights to and from Tel Aviv,"" BA said.
""We're contacting customers booked to travel to or from Tel Aviv to apologise for the inconvenience and offer options including a full refund and rebooking with another airline or with British Airways at a later date.
""We continue to monitor the situation in the region closely.""
Since Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Saturday, many international airlines have suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv, and securing flight bookings has become increasingly difficult.
For example, the first non-stop single flight available on El Al from Tel Aviv to Luton was on Friday 20 October, priced at $366 (£297).
On Tuesday,one travel agent said he been ""inundated""with calls from people trying to get flights back to the UK.
EasyJet, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have all suspended flights.
The UK government has not provided an estimate on how many UK citizens are in Israel, and no evacuation is currently planned.
However, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has advised people to register their presence to share updates ""including information to support you to leave the country"".
The government department advises against all but essential travel to Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Gaza and other parts of the region.
Travel insurance may not be valid if people travel against FCDO advice.
Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said that while the UK government has a duty to support its citizens, ""the situation here is a bit different because a lot of the Brits are dual nationals and regard Israel as their home"".
""We will work closely with the Israeli government to provide support, if needed,"" he said. ""We are working with the aviation industry and on border crossings. We are also in talks with Egypt on any Britons in Gaza.""

Five members of Palestinian militant group killed in Lebanon blast,,BBC,By David Gritten,"Five members of a Palestinian militant group have been killed and several more wounded by an explosion in Lebanon, close to the border with Syria.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) blamed Israel for the blast, saying it carried out an air strike on a site in the eastern town of Qusaya overnight.
But an Israeli source told the BBC that its military was not involved.
Lebanese security sources said it was caused by munitions being moved around.
It comes amid growing tensions between Israel and militants in Lebanon and Syria, who are armed and backed by Iran.
Photos purportedly from the scene of the explosionshowed a building in ruins and a badly damaged vehicle.
A statement from the PFLP-GC accused the Israeli military of bombing a site belonging to the group and vowed to retaliate.
""This crime is not isolated from the recent accelerating events on the Lebanese and Syrian fronts, and within the framework of continuous Zionist threats targeting resistance forces inside and outside Palestine,"" it said.
The Israeli military did not comment on the claim, but official sources denied it.
Lebanon's army also did not comment, but Reuters and AFP news agencies cited Lebanese and Palestinian security sources as saying it was an accidental explosion caused by mines or rockets detonating as they were being moved.
The PFLP-GC is a relatively small militant group formed as an offshoot of the PFLP in 1968. It gained notoriety in the 1970s and 80s for bombing an airliner and carrying out cross-border attacks into Israel.
According to the United States, which has designated the group as a terrorist organisation, the PFLP-GC has several hundred members operating in Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.
It says they receive logistical and military support from Syria's government, whose forces they have fought alongside during the country's civil war, as well as financial support from Iran.
In early April, the Israeli military carried out air strikes on what it said were installations belonging to the Palestinian militant group Hamas in southern Lebanon. The strikes were a response to a barrage of 34 rockets fired into northern Israel by militants in Lebanon the previous day.

"Allow more aid into Gaza, Lord Cameron urges Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel",2023-11-23,BBC,By James Landale in Israel & Chas Geiger,"Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has urged Israel to allow more aid into Gaza to show the Palestinian people and the world that the West wants to help.
He also said all possible precautions should be taken to minimise civilian casualties.
Lord Cameron had talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog.
He arrived amid uncertainty about when a pause in the fighting in Gaza, agreed with Hamas, would take effect.
Qatar said the truce, aimed at allowing some of the hostages held by Hamas and some Palestinians held in Israeli jails to be freed,would now begin on Friday morning.
Humanitarian aid would start being delivered to Palestinian civilians in Gaza as soon as possible after the fighting stopped, a Qatari foreign ministry spokesman added.
A four-day halt in the conflict had been due to come into force on Thursday morning, but was delayed.
The foreign secretary, who made a surprise return to government last week, said he hoped it could be an ""opportunity to crucially get hostages out and get aid into Gaza"".
Earlier, Lord Cameron visited Kibbutz Be'eri, the scene of one of the worst Hamas attacks on Israel which triggered the war on 7 October. Around 100 Israelis were killed, many of them women and children.
He said: ""I wanted to come here to see it for myself; I have heard and seen things I will never forget.""
As he met Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem, he added: ""There is never any excuse for this sort of hostage-taking.
""All the hostages should be released, but I hope that everyone who is responsible and behind this agreement can make it happen, to bring relief to those families, including, of course, there are British nationals who have been taken hostage.""
But as well as expressing support and solidarity, the foreign secretary also called on Israel to minimise civilian casualties and get more humanitarian aid into Gaza.
""It is vitally important that we demonstrate to the Palestinian people, to the world, that we want to help. Those people need food, they need water, they need medicine,"" he said.
A defiant Mr Netanyahu pledged: ""We will continue with the goals of the war and to destroy Hamas, because Hamas has already promised that they will do the same thing again and again and again.
""There is no hope for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel and the Arab countries if we do not eradicate this murderous movement, which threatens the future of all of us,"" he told the foreign secretary.
Until the pause comes into force, Israel has said it will continue to target Hamas.
Under the deal agreed, 50 hostages seized by Hamas last month would be released, along with more than a hundred Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails.
Meeting Mr Herzog, Lord Cameron spoke of a ""huge amount of trauma in Israel because of the taking of 244 hostages"".
He said he remembered ""the worst days of being prime minister was when British hostages were taken in Syria, and so many of them lost their lives in the most gruesome, terrible fashion"".
He added: ""I remember the effect that had on me as prime minister and thinking about that, and so perhaps know a tiny bit of what your nation is going through.""
On Wednesday, Lord Cameron met foreign ministers from Arab and Islamic countries - including the Palestinian Authority - at Lancaster House in London to discuss the crisis.
Counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Nigeria were there, as well as the secretary general of the League of Arab States and the ambassador of Qatar.
The foreign secretary said the group discussed how to use the planned pause in the fighting to consider ""how we can build a peaceful future which provides security for Israel but also peace and stability for the Palestinian people"".
Amnesty International UK's chief executive Sacha Deshmukh said ""short pauses"" were ""not enough"", and Lord Cameron should back a full ceasefire ""in the interests of averting further civilian suffering for Palestinians and Israelis"".
""With the horrifying civilian death toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza still rising and no permanent ceasefire in sight, it's vital that David Cameron uses this trip to signal an urgently needed change of direction from the UK Government in support of humanity and international law,"" he added.
The Hamas attacks in Israel last month killed some 1,200 people and saw about 240 taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said more than 14,000 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign.

Pro-Palestinian protest attracts thousands in Belfast city centre,2023-10-15,BBC,By Michael Fitzpatrick & Aileen Moynagh,"Thousands of pro-Palestinian protestors have attended a rally in Belfast.
Demonstrators gathered at Writers Square on Sunday before marching along Royal Avenue to Belfast City Hall. There were a series of speeches at the event, which lasted about two hours.
Similar protestshave taken place across the UK over the weekend, including in London, Glasgow, and Manchester.
About 100 people also attended a vigil in Belfast in support of Israel.
The protests come a week after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel.
Fighters from the the Palestinian militant group entered communities near the Gaza Strip, killing at least 1,300 people.
About 2,300 people have been killed in Gaza by Israel's retaliatory air strikes and a ground offensive on the region is also expected.
About 1.1 million people in the north of Gaza have been told by Israel's military to move to the south, with Israel saying it will allow a safe route for a limited time.
But the World Health Organisation (WHO) has criticised the order to move hospital patients from the north, saying it is tantamount to a death sentence.
Assembly members Pat Sheehan, of Sinn Féin, and Gerry Caroll, from People Before Profit, were among those to address the crowd.
Also present at the event were representatives from the Northern Ireland Council for Racial Equality, ICTU, Unison and the Jews for Palestine group.
Some minor scuffles broke out when the march arrived at Belfast City Hall as protestors were met with a small number of pro-Israel supporters.
Saeb Shaath's family are in Gaza and have been denied access to water, electricity and fuel, he said.
""We lost a lot of people, I lost four from my own family,"" he said.
""We thank the people in Belfast here to show their support, but at the same time we feel dismayed by western leaders.
""This is a war crime what's happening in Gaza, a war crime supported by some British politicians and American politicians.""
Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin has said that he is ""deeply concerned"" at the situation in Israel and Gaza.
""The decision by the Israeli military to tell the entire civilian population in the north of the Gaza strip to move southward for their own safety is deeply dangerous and impossible to implement,"" Mr Martin said.
""There is no doubt about the brutal criminality of Hamas and their utter disregard for human life, including the lives of their fellow Palestinians, but we absolutely must distinguish between Hamas and Palestinian civilians in Gaza.""
Mr Martin said that Israel ""has a right to defend itself from attack"" but it must do so ""within the parameters of international humanitarian law"".
During a meeting in Paris on Sunday evening, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed cooperation on evacuating citizens from Gaza as it faces the threat of a ground invasion by Israeli forces.
Mr Varadkar said that there are about 40 Irish citizens in Gaza who are UN aid workers or dual citizens and arrangements are being made to evacuate them if they want to leave.
Irish-Israeli woman,Kim Damti, was killed in last weekend's Hamas attack at a music festival. The 22-year-old was last seen at the Supernova music festival in Re'im in southern Israel last Saturday.
Meanwhile, Tom Hand, who is originally from Dublin, said that his eight-year-old daughter, Emily, had been killed in Hamas' attack on the Kibbutz Be'eri last Saturday. He told broadcaster, CNN, that his daughter had gone to stay at her friend's house in the kibbutz near Gaza last Friday night, and it was two days before he found out that she was dead.
At Sunday's vigil for Israel, which was also held at the gates of Belfast City Hall, organiser and director of March of Life UK Mike McNally said that the event was an opportunity to ""pray for Israel, and for all the innocent lives that have been lost"".
He said that it was important to ""stand with our Jewish community here"", many of whom he said were fearful of anti-Semitic attacks following recent events.
Mr McNally said that the conflict is ""very sad"" and his hope is that ""less life is lost"" over the coming weeks.

Rashida Tlaib censured over Israel-Gaza comments,,BBC,By Emily Atkinson,"The US Congress has voted to censure its only Palestinian-American member over comments she made on the Israel-Gaza war.
Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib was rebuked for her defence of the chant ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"".
The resolution formally condemned her for ""calling for the destruction of the state of Israel"".
The measure passed by 234 to 188 votes. Twenty-two Democrats voted to censure.
Ms Tlaibposted a videoto Twitter on Friday that included a clip of protestors using the chant, which critics say calls for Palestinian control of all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Israel.
The video also accused President Joe Biden of supporting genocide in Gaza and called for a ceasefire.
The Anti-Defamation Leagueand Jewish groups say the slogan, used at protests around the world, is a call for the destruction of Israel.
Pro-Palestinian activists argue that most people using it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the elimination of Israel itself.
Ms Tlaib later defended her use of the slogan, calling it ""an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.""
The comment stirred up cross-party condemnation and criticism from allies in her own state, prompting two separate measures seeking to censure her.
Republican Representative Rich McCormick, who represents Georgia, introduced a resolution on Monday, accusing Ms Tlaib of ""calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and dangerously promoting false narratives"" about Hamas's attack on Israel.
Twenty-two Democrats joined the vast majority of Republicans voting for Ms Tlaib's censure.
After the vote, Ms Tlaib told the house that her comments were directed at the Israeli government.
""I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. We are human beings, just like anyone else,"" she said.
More than 1,400 Israelis were killed in the 7 October attack by Hamas.
The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 10,300 Palestinians have since been killed in Israeli attacks.
The Biden administration has dismissed calls for a ceasefire in favour of a humanitarian pause to allow aid, food and water into Gaza.

"Some Gazans returning to north despite risks, UN says",,BBC,By David Gritten,"Some Palestinians who fled their homes in the north of Gaza are starting to return because of the dire situation in the south, a senior UN official says.
Israel told 1.1 million residents of Gaza City and other northern areas to leave for their own safety last week.
But the UN official said they were struggling to find shelter, food and drinking water in the south.
The Hamas-run health ministry also said hundreds had been killed there in Israeli air strikes over the past day.
The Israeli military said it had hit hundreds of military targets belonging to Hamas across Gaza, as it stepped up its air campaign ahead of an expected ground offensive.
More than 5,000 people are now reported to have been killed across the Strip, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since Israel began its bombardment in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas on 7 October, in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 222 taken hostage.
Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.
The UN estimates that almost two thirds of Gaza's population - 1.4 million people - have fled their homes over the past two weeks either out of fear or because their homes have been destroyed or damaged.
The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Khan Younis saysthe southern city has been overwhelmed by the influx of between 600,000 and 700,000 displaced people, with many sheltering inside hospitals, clubs and restaurants, or even forced to sleep in the streets.
The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that most displaced people were living off just 1 litre (34 fl oz) of water and one or two small rounds of Arabic bread a day.
The humanitarian crisis, combined with continued strikes on civilian areas in the south, meant that ""some people are going back to the north"", he said.
""Essentially, people have left everything in the north - their houses, their businesses, their lives. They've come to the south where they are struggling to find shelter, food is scarce, many people are having to drink unpotable water, so the situation in the south is dire.""
Riyad Jaabas, a displaced man staying in Khan Younis, told Reuters news agency: ""We were expelled from Gaza City. They said Khan Younis is a safe area, now there is no safe space in all Gaza.""
On Saturday, leaflets dropped over Gaza City by the Israeli military warned that anyone who did not move south of the Wadi Gaza river ""might be identified as an accomplice in a terrorist organisation"".
And although the UN welcomed the arrival of 34 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies over the weekend, Mr White warned that hundreds more a day were required to meet Gaza's needs, particularly those carrying fuel.
""Before the conflict Gaza was receiving about 455 trucks a day, so we've got a long way to go to scale up the logistics operation.""
""We have about three days left of fuel inside Gaza,"" he added ""This is something that Israel needs to allow to enter Gaza, otherwise our aid operation will come to a halt. Desalinization plants will start running out of water. Hospitals will start having to shut down their wards.""
Gaza's health ministry warned that the generators at 13 public hospitals were running out of fuel and that they were only running the most essential life-saving services, including incubators helping to keep 130 babies alive.
Israel is refusing to allow fuel in, saying it could be stolen and exploited by Hamas for military purposes.
An Israeli defence ministry agency said on Sunday thatHamas had ""a fuel reserve of 1 million litres"". It accused the group of ""refusing to hand [fuel] out to facilities in need"" and using it for ""lighting up their terror tunnels, for rocket launchers, and for their own homes"".
On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that its forces had struck 320 targets in Gaza over the past day, including ""tunnels containing Hamas terrorists, dozens of operational command centres... military compounds, and observation posts"".
""Furthermore, the IDF struck targets that posed a threat to forces in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip who are preparing for ground operations, including dozens of mortar shell and anti-tank missile launch posts,"" it added.
Overnight, videos shared on social media showed the blasts of successive Israeli strikes on Gaza lighting up the sky.
The director of the Al-Quds hospital in Gaza City told the BBC that there were 10 strikes within 100m (330ft) of the facility, where there were 500 patients and another 1,500 people taking shelter.
On Monday afternoon, Gaza's health ministry said 436 people, including 182 children, had been killed in the past 24 hours, most of them in the south.
The ministry also announced that the overall death toll in Gaza since Israel began responding to Hamas's cross-border attack had risen to 5,087.
The figure includes 471 people who the health ministry said were killed byan explosion at al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City. Hamas blamed an Israeli air strike, but the IDF presented evidence that it said showed the blast was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
On Monday, the UK government said it had also assessed that the explosion was ""likely caused by a missile or part of one that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel"", echoing the conclusions of the US, France and Canada.
The IDF says 7,000 rockets have been fired towards Israel by Hamas and other groups in Gaza since 7 October, with 550 failing and landing inside Gaza.

Canadians stuck in Gaza as other foreigners leave,2023-11-03,BBC,By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Nadine Yousif,"Hundreds of Canadians remain trapped in Gaza as foreign nationals from other countries have been able to cross into Egypt.
No Canadian was on the latest list published by Gaza border authorities of those approved to leave on Friday.
One family said they received a call from Canadian officials to be ready at a moment's notice, but have not yet been informed on when they could leave.
Canada has registered about 450 of its citizens who want to leave Gaza.
So far, dozens of Americans have been able to leave in the last three days. People from other countries, including Britain, Sri Lanka, Mexico and European nationals have either left or are on the approved list to leave.
Dozens of seriously injured Palestinians were also allowed to cross into Egypt since Wednesday.
One Canadian has managed to leave Gaza, who was reportedly able to exit ""with a third party"", although the government declined to give details, citing privacy considerations.
The BBC understands there are about 7,000 dual nationals in Gaza.
In an update on social media late Thursday evening, Canada's foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly said she spoke to her Israeli counterpart, Eli Cohen, and was reassured that Canadians would be able to leave ""in the coming days"".
""My Egyptian counterpart confirmed their cooperation,"" Ms Joly said. ""Global Affairs Canada will communicate the latest information directly with Canadians.""
The lists of those allowed to cross is agreed upon between Egypt and Israel, with embassies from the relevant countries being informed in advance to ensure they can prepare to receive their citizens, Western officials have said.
In total, Canada has provided authorities in the region with a list of about 450 eligible citizens, permanent residents and family members who want to leave the embattled territory.
It is one of the largest contingents of foreign nationals in Gaza, Canadian officials said.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was questioned on Thursday on why Canadians had not yet received approval to leave.
""Obviously, the Rafah crossing is an extremely complicated place right now,"" Mr Trudeau said.
""We're pushing on our friends in Israel and our friends in Egypt, working with Americans and others, to make sure that the Canadian families get on the list,"" he said.
OneCanadian family in Gaza told the Canadian Press that they received a call from officialson Thursday telling them to gather their documents to prepare to leave, but they were not given a date or time.
Mahmoud Nasser said he and his family - including his pregnant wife - were sheltering at a refugee camp, a 20-minute ride away from the Rafah border crossing.
""It's kind of a dilemma for all of us,"" he said. ""We're not sure what to do with this situation.""
He was told that a bus would be waiting for Canadians and their families on the Egyptian side once they were allowed to cross.
Others say they have received no word yet from Global Affairs Canada.
A spokeswoman for a Palestinian Canadian group that met Mr Trudeau this week told the BBC that many are feeling ""very upset and frustrated"" that the Canadian government has been unsuccessful in securing safe passage for its trapped citizen
Reem Sultan said that - in contrast to the government's official statements - some Canadian friends and acquaintances of hers in Gaza have not yet been contacted by officials.
She said that some families with relatives in Gaza believe they ""are being treated differently"" than Canadian citizens who were evacuated from Tel Aviv in the early stages of the war.
According to the Canadian Air Force, more than 1,600 Canadians were flown out of Israel on 19 separate flights by military aircraft, with the last flight taking off on 23 October.
""Now, we're not putting on enough pressure to get our citizens out...many are feeling as though they are not as important,"" she said. ""This is the part that is very confusing and frustrating for families.""
Canadians in Gaza have reported that they are facing mounting humanitarian issues, including shortages of fuel, lack of food, and contaminated water amid heavy airstrikes and bombardment from Israeli aircraft and artillery.
""Every minute that passes, people die,"" she said. ""Our families are at risk of dying at any moment.""
The group also demanded that Canada call for an immediate ceasefire in the war and a humanitarian corridor to allow food, water and fuel to be shipped into Gaza.
Canada, along with the US, the UK, and EU, has stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, instead pushing for a humanitarian ""pause"" in the conflict.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the Strip since the beginning of the war.
Six Canadians were killed when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 242 hostages.
At least two Canadians are still reported missing.

Israel-Gaza attacks: Vigil for victims held at Downing Street,2023-10-10,BBC,By Doug Faulkner & Lucy Manning,"A vigil has been held outside Downing Street amid shock and grief in the aftermath of Hamas's attacks on Israel.
Candles were lit in memory of the victims, while some held pictures of dead loved ones and those held captive.
Rishi Sunak joined prayers at a north London synagogue, where he told the British Jewish community he would ""stop at nothing"" to keep them safe.
Meanwhile, three people were arrested following a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the Israeli embassy.
About 900 people have died in Israel since Saturday's surprise attack, while retaliatory strikes on Gaza have killed almost 690.
Civilians have been taken hostage and the armed wing of Hamas has threatened to kill them if Palestinian civilians are not warned about impending air strikes.
More than 10 Britons are feared dead or missing following the attacksincluding Nathanel Young and Bernard Cowan.
Many of those taking part in the Downing Street vigil would have had relatives or friends affected by the Hamas attacks, with Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis saying there washardly a Jewish family in the UK not affected.
Rabbi Ephraim told the vigil that British Jews were ""at one"" with the people of Israel and that they stood ""shoulder to shoulder with you at this time"".
He said he prayed that ""the darkness we are enduring will lead to light. That the chaos, confusion and bitterness, the mourning and the grief, will be replaced by peace.""
Israel's ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, told the crowds it was ""so clear that it is a fight between good and evil"" and that ""good will prevail"".
One Israeli who attended the vigil was Hanna Wine, who was supposed to be back in Israel on Monday.
""I'm currently stuck here. My flight got cancelled. I have a close friend who's missing, she's probably been taken into Gaza, I don't know what's happening to her.
""I don't think anyone here gets how bad the situation is there. Every single person I know, every boy I know has been drafted. People have been murdered in cold blood.""
Later on Monday evening, Mr Sunak spoke at Finchley United Synagogue.
The prime minister said: ""I wanted to come here tonight to stand with you, to stand with you in this hour of grief as we mourn the victims of an utterly abhorrent act of terror, to stand with you in this hour of prayer, as we think of those held hostage and your friends and loved ones taking refuge in bomb shelters, or risking their lives on the frontline.
""And perhaps above all, I wanted to come here tonight to stand with you in solidarity in Israel's hour of need.""
In a joint statement issued on Monday, Mr Sunak, US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni promised their ""steadfast and united support to the state of Israel"" and their ""unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism"".
""In recent days, the world has watched in horror as Hamas terrorists massacred families in their homes, slaughtered over 200 young people enjoying a music festival, and kidnapped elderly women, children, and entire families, who are now being held as hostages,"" they said.
The leaders said they recognised the ""legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people"", but ""Hamas does not represent those aspirations, and it offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed"".
Thousands took part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration which took place near the Israeli embassy in Kensington, west London. Groups including Stop the War and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign were represented.
Large groups of police officers watched on as flares were lit and placards calling for Israel to ""end the occupation"" were waved.
A 15-year-old male was arrested on Kensington High Street on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker, while a 70-year-old man was arrested in the Kensington area on suspicion of racially motivated criminal damage, police said.
A 29-year-old man was also arrested in Oxford Street on suspicion on causing actual bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon, police added.
In response to the attacks by Hamas, Israel has ordered a ""complete siege"" of the Gaza Strip, cutting off food, fuel, electricity and water supplies.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman has written to police chiefs in England and Wales urging them to step up patrols and use their powers to prevent ""disorder and distress to our communities"".
""There is no place for demonstrations, convoys, or flag-waving on British streets that glorifies terrorism or harasses the Jewish community,"" she said.

Netanyahu meets Israeli hostages' families anxious over Gaza war plans,,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met families of Israelis held hostage by Hamas, who have expressed concern about the intensifying attacks on Gaza.
The Missing Families Forum said the night when troops moved into northern Gaza had been ""the worst"" so far.
They complained about the impact of a ground operation on the well-being of the 230 hostages.
Mr Netanyahu has promised to do everything possible to bring them home.
Ahead of the meeting, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said their relatives ""are anxious about the fate of their loved ones and are waiting for an explanation"" of the Israeli military's actions.
In response to the statement, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he would meet representatives of the group on Sunday.
During the meeting, Mr Netanyahu said that recovering the hostages was an ""integral"" part of the military's goals.
""Pressure is key. The greater the pressure the greater the chances,"" he said.
The hostages were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.
After the meeting, Hamas said Israel would have to release all Palestinian prisoners to secure freedom for the hostages.
Mr Netanyahu said the idea of a swap deal involving hostages for prisoners had been discussed within the Israeli war cabinet but declined to give details.
At a separate news conference, Mr Gallant said Hamas had to be forced to the negotiating table but it was ""very complex"".
""The more military pressure, the more firepower and the more we strike Hamas - the greater our chances are to bring it to a place where it will agree to a solution that will allow the return of your loved ones,"" Mr Gallant told a news conference.
Those in captivity in Gaza include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as military personnel. At least 135 are foreign or dual nationals, including 54 Thais, 15 Argentines and two Britons, according to the Israeli government.
Hamas - which is designated as a terrorist group by Israel, the UK and other powers - has so far released four hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. Two elderly Israeli women were freed on Monday, while an American-Israeli woman and her daughter were freed on 20 October.
There had been speculation before Friday night's ground operation that Qatar-brokered negotiations over another release deal were accelerating.
But Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Saturday that there was ""a deliberate desire of parties with interests, led by Hamas, to make cynical exploitation, psychological terrorism, and to influence our population which is in such a sensitive situation"".
""Most importantly, when we have the information, we will provide it,"" he added. ""Returning the hostages home is a supreme national effort. And all our activities, operational, intelligence, are aimed at realizing a goal.""
Released hostage Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was kidnapped alongside her husband Oded from Kibbutz Nir Oz, told reporters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday thatshe ""went through hell"".
She described being hit by sticks on the journey to Gaza and being taken into a huge network of underground tunnels that ""looked like a spider's web"".
Mrs Lifschitz also said that most of the hostages were being ""treated well"".
On Thursday, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing, Abu Ubaida, said around 50 hostages had been killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza.
He provided no evidence and it was impossible for the BBC to verify the claim. But the Israeli military has repeatedly said it has bombed Hamas's tunnels.

Arab and Muslim leaders blame West for Gaza misery,,BBC,By Frank Gardner,"Hypocrisy, double standards and a failure to understand the region. These are the charges being levelled at the West, primarily the US, by leaders of 57 Arab and Muslim countries who convened at the weekend in the Saudi capital Riyadh.
How is it, foreign ministers said to me, that the West slams Russia for killing civilians in Ukraine, yet, in their words, it ""gives a green light to Israel to do the same in Gaza""?
In the luxurious surroundings of Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, amid giant floral bouquets and glittering chandeliers, and a world away from the shattered landscape of Gaza, princes, presidents and prime ministers met for the Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit.
Blame for the war and the destruction of lives and property was heaped unilaterally on Israel and its supporters. No-one criticised Hamas for its 7 October raid into southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw some 240 taken hostage, triggering the massive military retaliation. Israel, said the secretary general of the Arab League, had committed criminal acts.
""We warn of the disastrous repercussions of the retaliatory aggression by Israel against the Gaza Strip, which amounts to a war crime,"" said the final communique. ""We warn of the real danger of the expansion of the war as a result of Israel's refusal to stop its aggression and of the inability of the [UN] Security Council to enforce international law to end this aggression.""
Few people I spoke to at the summit expected Israel to take much notice. Instead, it was clear that this summit and its intended message of unity was aimed at Israel's biggest backer - the United States. Leaders want the Biden administration and the West in general to exert sufficient pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether.
But what they could not agree on was how to achieve that. The summit pulled together some strange bedfellows - an indication of just how worried the region is at events in Gaza spiralling beyond their control.
Iran - Israel's main adversary - attended, with President Ebrahim Raisi striding across the carpeted halls in his black, cleric's robes, flanked by his scowling security men in dark suits and collarless shirts. This in itself was a surprising sight.
Until they patched over their differences in March this year, Saudi Arabia and Iran were arch rivals exchanging venomous mutual accusations. They still have competing agendas, with Iran backing what many call its ""proxy militias"" - Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.
The Saudis, together with their conservative Arab allies like Egypt and Jordan, see these movements as dangerous destabilisers.
As he departed Tehran airport for Riyadh, President Raisi said that now was the time for action over Gaza, not words.
But anyone expecting concrete, punitive actions against the US or the UK was left disappointed. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which only recently opened full diplomatic, trade and security ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, resisted calls to break them off.
Syria's President Bashar al-Assad was also at the summit. Until very recently he was a pariah in the Arab world for the repressive actions of his regime in Syria's civil war. He told the summit it would achieve little without concrete measures, but suggestions of an oil embargo or the expulsion of US bases from Arab countries were quietly batted away.
Yet there is no denying that the 7 October Hamas raid and the ensuing war has changed the whole paradigm in the Middle East.
Up until that murderous morning in southern Israel the tectonic plates of regional politics were shifting away from the interests of Iran and its militant allies. Six Arab nations had already established full ties with Israel; Saudi Arabia was well on the way to being next. The Israeli tourism minister visited Riyadh just days before the Hamas raid. Dubai has been luring Israeli tourists in large numbers and there has been a huge Arab appetite for Israel's expertise in technology, surveillance, bio-tech and other sectors.
With the exception of Qatar, which hosts the exiled political leaders of Hamas, Gulf Arab rulers had grown tired of what they saw as the corruption, inefficiency and infighting of Palestinian leadership. While sympathetic to the plight of ordinary Palestinians, still without a state after 75 years, they largely took the view that Israel was too important a nation to ignore, and that it was time to move on and normalise ties with it. The question of a future Palestinian state, while still featuring in speeches, was getting little practical attention.
Today, those Arab-Israeli ties, while not yet broken, are certainly fraying at the edges.
""We are really worried about the radicalisation of our youth,"" one Arab foreign minister told me on background. ""They watch what is happening in Gaza on TV and they are increasingly angry.""
Time and again I heard delegates complain that the actions of the Netanyahu government have gone far beyond self-defence and are now dragging the region down a dangerous path. There are concerns that extremist narratives are gaining popularity online.
Arab and Muslim leaders are frustrated that the UN Security Council has failed in their eyes to exercise any restraint on Israel's military in Gaza. America's opposition to a ceasefire has deeply embarrassed those countries it calls allies in the region.
Washington's strategic alliance with the oil-rich Gulf Arab states dates back to 1945 and a wartime meeting on a US warship in the Red Sea between President Roosevelt and the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz. Today, the US still provides the bulk of Saudi and Gulf Arab defence and security needs.
But below the surface things are changing. Ever since the Obama administration's ""pivot to Asia"" there has been a fear here in the Gulf that the US is losing interest in the region, that it cannot be relied upon as a loyal partner. At the same time, the influences of Moscow and Beijing are in the ascendant. China recently brokered the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. President Putin has impressed Arab leaders with his unstinting support for Syria's President Assad. They compare this with how quickly Washington abandoned Egypt's President Mubarak in 2011 when the crowds came out on Cairo's Tahrir Square.
None of this means the West has lost the friends it had in the Middle East. Those Arab allies are clearly reluctant to go beyond angry words with Washington. But they do want to be heard and for the violence in Gaza to stop now, before events in the region and in their own countries risk deteriorating far beyond their control.

"Gaza: 'My wife died in five minutes, she was my life'",,BBC,,"A man who grew up in Belfast has returned to Ireland after his wife and other family members were killed in Gaza.
Khalid El-Estal, 30, said he had been working in Saudi Arabia while his family remained in the Palestinian territory.
Gaza has been bombed by Israel as part of its conflict with Hamas.
Mr El-Estal said he had ""lost everything"" but is hoping his two young children can join him in Dublin.
""I want to take them out, I want word from the government. They are Irish,"" he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ on Friday.
His children, aged one and four, remain in Gaza with their grandparents, he said.
He added he feared for their lives without assistance from the Irish authorities.
Mr El-Estal was born in Belfast and attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University.
When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where Khalid met his wife, Ashwak Jendia, at university.
""She was my life,"" he said.
Asviolence in the regionescalated last week, Mr El-Estal explained he urged his wife to move south and stay with his relatives, while he contacted Irish officials to seek help.
""The exact day she [arrived] in my family's place they bombed the place,"" Mr El-Estal said.
The bomb killed his mother and brother ""immediately"", he added.
He continued that his uncle, and his uncle's two daughters - both doctors - were also killed in the blast, and both of Khalid's children were buried in rubble.
Ashwak was taken to hospital, eventually dying from her injuries, which included 60% burns to her body, he detailed.
""It's killing me,"" he said. ""I lost everything, it's not only me, I am better than a lot of people in Gaza,"" Mr El-Estal said.
Now, he said he cannot bring himself to tell his children that their mother has died.
Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 9,000 people had been killed in the Strip since 7 October.
In a statement, an Irish Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said more than 8,000 foreign and dual nationals are in Gaza.
This includes thousands of dependent children who are entitled to dual citizenship in various countries.
However, the spokesperson said evacuations will take some time to complete.
""Time? Time means death. My wife died in five minutes,"" Mr El-Estal told RTÉ.

Gaza before and after: Satellite images show destruction,,BBC,By The Visual Journalism Team,"New satellite images of Gaza show the extent of the destruction caused by Israel's intense aerial bombardment of the territory - home to 2.2 million people - over the past three weeks.
The pictures, released by Maxar Technologies, compare detailed images captured from space earlier this week with images from before the recent conflict began.
They show three areas in the north of Gaza where aerial attacks have left dozens of tower blocks completely destroyed or badly damaged as well as large areas of tightly packed buildings reduced to piles of grey rubble.
Beit Hanoun, a settlement in the north-eastern corner of Gaza that is just 2km (1.2 miles) away from the border with Israel, is one area shown to have been badly affected. The Israeli military have said the area is a hub for Hamas and it was one of the first areas where Israel warned residents to leave.
The area of Beit Hanoun shown below sits on the main road to the Erez border crossing. Several multi-storey buildings that were visible just over two weeks ago are now barely standing.
The Hamas-run housing ministry has estimated that about 45% of all the housing units in the territory have been either completely destroyed, rendered uninhabitable or damaged. An estimated 1.4 million people are internally displaced.
Thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes in the north of Gaza after being told by the Israeli military to leave for their own safety - but some have returned to the north because strikes are also being carried out in the south.
Al Karama, shown below, sits on Gaza's northern coast on the Mediterranean sea. Areas just behind the main coastal road, where several hotels are located, have been hit by Israeli strikes.
InAtatra, which is about 3km (1.8 miles) south of the Israeli border, more than 20 high-rise blocks and several buildings have been badly damaged. A sports facility just south of the tower blocks, seen in the image below, was covered by grey ash from the attacks.

Released Palestinians allege abuse in Israeli jails,,BBC,By Lucy Williamson,"Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails say that guards carried out abuse and collective punishment in the weeks after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October.
They have described being hit with sticks, having muzzled dogs set on them, and their clothes, food and blankets taken away.
One female prisoner has said she was threatened with rape, and that guards twice tear-gassed inmates inside the cells.
The BBC spoke to six people in total, all of whom said they were beaten before leaving jail.
The Palestinian Prisoners Society says some guards are alleged to have urinated on handcuffed prisoners. And that six prisoners have died in Israeli custody in the past seven weeks.
Israel says all its prisoners are detained according to the law.
Eighteen-year-old Mohammed Nazzal was one of those released by Israel this week, in exchange for Israeli women and children held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.
He had been held in custody in Nafha Prison without charge since August, and says he does not know why he was arrested.
Mohammed invited me to his home, down a winding alley in the village of Qabatiya near Jenin, in the north of the occupied West Bank.
The family reception room at the top of the old house was fogged by the smoke of a dozen cigarettes - a cousin circled the visitors with a flask of coffee and a tall tower of tiny paper cups.
Mohammed sat flanked by rows of male relatives, both his hands heavily bandaged, held up in front of him stiffly like a boxer, the tip of his thumbs peeking out.
Ten days ago, he says, Israeli prison guards came into his cell with a microphone and speaker, and tried to provoke the prisoners by clapping and screaming their names.
""When they saw we weren't reacting,"" he says, ""they started to beat us.""
""They arranged us so that the elderly prisoners were put in the back and the young in front. They took me and started beating me. I was trying to protect my head, and they were trying to break my legs and my hands.""
The family showed us medical reports and X-rays from Palestinian doctors in Ramallah who examined Mohammed after he was released on Monday.
We showed the X-ray pictures to two doctors in the UK, who confirmed that they showed fractures in both hands. It was no surprise to Mohammed.
""In the beginning, I was in a lot of pain,"" he tells me. ""Then after a while, I knew that they were broken, so I stopped using them. I only used them when I went to the toilet.""
He says the other prisoners helped him eat, drink and use the bathroom, and that he did not ask the guards for medical help out of fear that he would be beaten again.
The Israel Prison Service has disputed Mohammed's story, saying that he had been examined by a medic before leaving prison, with no medical problem diagnosed.
The prison service also released a video of the teenager leaving prison and boarding a Red Cross bus before his release, which it says proves that his claims are false.
In the footage, the teenager's hands are unbandaged, and appear to be hanging by his sides - including as he climbs onto the bus - but are out of shot for most of the video.
Mohammed told us that the first medical treatment he received was on that Red Cross bus.
A medical report from a hospital in Ramallah the day he arrived back home advised that a plate might have to be fitted, if his fractures did not heal by themselves.
We asked the Red Cross to confirm Mohammed's story. They said in a statement: ""We speak directly with the detaining authorities if we have any concerns about the medical condition of detainees. Due to this dialogue, we do not speak publicly about individual cases.""
Mohammed says the behaviour of guards inside Israeli jails changed after the Hamas attacks on 7 October.
He says guards kicked them, and used sticks to hit them, and describes one guard stepping on his face.
""They came in with their dogs,"" he continues. ""They let the dogs attack us and then they started beating us.""
""They took out mattresses, our clothes, our pillows, and they threw our food on the floor. People were terrified.""
He shows me the marks on his back and shoulder that he says were the result of these beatings.
""The dog attacking me wore a muzzle with very sharp edges - his muzzle and claws left marks all over my body,"" he tells me.
Beatings like this happened twice at Megiddo Prison, he says, and more times than he could count at Nafha Prison.
Other Palestinian prisoners we have spoken to have described a similar shift inside Israel's jails after the Hamas attacks, saying they understood it as ""revenge"" against Palestinian prisoners for the actions of Hamas.
The head of the Palestinian Prisoners Society, Abdullah al-Zaghary, told us that many prisoners had witnessed cellmates being violently beaten on their faces and bodies, and that he had heard allegations of guards urinating on handcuffed prisoners.
We asked the Israel Prison Service for a response to these allegations. They said all prisoners were detained according to the law and had all the basic rights legally required.
""We are not aware of the claims you described,"" the statement said. ""Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined by official authorities.""
Lama Khater, released from prison earlier this week, published a video on social media alleging that an intelligence officer had ""explicitly threatened her with rape"" immediately after her arrest in late October.
""I was handcuffed and blindfolded,"" she told an interviewer in the video. ""They threatened to rape me... It was clear the goal was to intimidate me.""
Israel said these claims were made by her lawyer and had been denied by the prisoner herself. The prison service had filed a complaint for incitement, it said.
But Lama Khater told us by telephone that women prisoners - including herself - had indeed been threatened with rape, and that tear gas had been used against prisoners in their dormitory at Damon Prison.
The Palestinian Prisoners Society says there has been a sharp rise in the number of Palestinian deaths in custody since the 7 October attacks, with six people dying in jail since that date.
Israel did not address our question about this directly, but said that four prisoners had died on four different dates over the past weeks, and that the prison service had no knowledge of the causes of death.
In Qabatiya village, Mohammed Nazzal says his hands still give him pain, especially at night.
His brother Mutaz told me the teenager he knew before had not returned from jail.
""This is not the Mohammed we know,"" he said. ""He was brave, courageous. Now his heart is broken and filled with terror.""
The previous night, he said, the Israeli army had carried out an operation in the city of Jenin, 4km (2.5 miles) away: ""You could see how scared he was.""

"'A lot of adrenaline, a lot of unknowns': Reservists flock to join Israel's fight",2023-10-10,BBC,By Joel Gunter,"As Israel rushed onto a war footing on Saturday morning, young army reservists around the country were already moving faster than the military machine.
""From 6.30am, we were itching to know why we weren't being called up already,"" said Michael Goldberg, a 24-year-old reservist in Jerusalem.
Mr Goldberg had woken up early to a flood of videos of Hamas's devastating attack. He had only recently returned to Jerusalem, to visit family after moving to the US six months earlier. Watching the attack unfold, he knew instantly that he would not be returning to the US.
Instead, Mr Goldberg began to pack underwear and socks, and make whatever other preparations he could to serve his country.
""I guess in most places, you wait for the call,"" he said. ""In Israel you start to get ready before it comes.""
Israel is still reeling from Saturday's surprise attack by Hamas militants, who killed at least 1,000 people and wounded many more. In the few days since, the nation of more than nine million has called up a record 360,000 reservists to help respond.
Israel's army relies on an enormous reserve contingent, made up of civilians who have completed their compulsory national service but can be mobilised again for duty until the age of 40.
On Saturday afternoon, Mr Goldberg finally got the call he was waiting for. But he wasn't mobilised immediately. Sitting in his family home early on Monday morning, he was impatient to go.
""There is a tremendous amount of fear,"" he said. ""But you are also inspired in ways you have never been before. I realised that this is the defining moment of my life.""
Mr Goldberg's eagerness has been mirrored across the nation and beyond. So many reservists have felt compelled to return to duty that Israel's El Al airline announced it would run extra flights to bring home those abroad.
Some who have already joined up have complained that there is not enough kit to go around. And at some muster points in Jerusalem at the weekend, volunteers were turned back because their units were already over capacity, or still catching up.
""I drove one of my sons to the base today and they said we are not organised enough yet, come back in two days,"" said Alan Sacks, a Jerusalem lawyer and father of six.
Of Mr Sacks' five sons, three had already been mobilised over the weekend. One was still trying to find a place. His youngest, aged 25, was ""very much in the hotspot at the moment,"" Mr Sacks said - working with a special forces unit near Gaza.
""Two weeks ago, Israel was torn apart, left against right,"" he said, referring to recent large-scale protests over controversial judicial reforms. ""And now you have all these reservists lining up together to go. It's an extraordinary transformation.""
Mr Sacks was receiving updates via WhatsApp on Monday from his mobilised sons. He smiled with pride when his phone buzzed with a selfie from the 25-year-old, who had been able to communicate the least.
The nation's civilian military was ""fundamental to the existence of Israel,"" he said. ""This is not an anonymous army, everyone has a child or a cousin or a father who is involved.""
Calls have now gone out to reservists from their early twenties all the way up to those aged 40 - the cut-off age at which you become exempt from duty.
Shay, 40, a taxi driver in Jerusalem, who did not want to give his full name, was on holiday in Greece when he got the call. It had been 20 years since his national service, he said, but he had done refresher training over the years to avoid becoming rusty with a gun.
""Even if I was exempt I would still go,"" he said. ""I want to go for me, and for my country, but I have two young children and I am scared.""
Elkana Bar Etan, a 38-year-old reservist, didn't wait for the call. ""I just texted my commander to say I'm here, and he texted right away and said come,"" Mr Bar Etan said.
He was immediately deployed to the border with Lebanon, from where he spoke to the BBC. As he spoke, mortar strikes could be heard in the background.
""I never in my worst nightmares imagined that this would be the circumstances for being called up again,"" he said.
""I'm here on the border, in full uniform, and I'm thinking about my children. But my decision was simple, really, you feel the obligation.""
Even the cut off age did not stop the volunteers. At Jerusalem's main bus station on Monday, Nissim Baranes, 45, was sitting in uniform waiting for a public bus south that, so far, didn't seem to be coming.
""I think the public transport is also operating on emergency terms,"" he said.
Mr Baranes was doubly exempt from duty, because not only was he over 40 but he also had six children - the number that excuses a parent from being called up.
And yet there he was, alone at the bus station, with a modest rucksack, trying to get himself closer to somewhere he could be useful.
""It is a good feeling to put on the uniform again,"" he said. ""These are hard days for Israel.""
For some parents, this is not the first time they have watched their sons and daughters go to take part in this conflict.
One of Mr Sacks' sons served in the 2014 Gaza war. During that time, he and his wife Judith would sit on the front balcony of their house, dreading the appearance of a uniformed soldier walking up the driveway, Judith said.
That feeling was now rushing back, she said, with tears in her eyes. ""Then there was one child serving, now there are two serving and two more waiting to go in.""
The reservists already in position and those still waiting to go said they had no idea how long this new mobilisation would last. Israel has launched waves of retaliatory air strikes against the Gaza Strip which have killed at least 900 people. Many are expecting a ground invasion that could bring weeks of suffering.
""There is a mixed feeling of wanting it to end now and wanting to change the Middle East,"" said Michael Goldberg, the 24-year-old reservist who was waiting impatiently to leave.
""There is a lot of mixed emotion, a lot of adrenaline, and a lot of unknowns,"" he said.

Israeli settler violence brings destruction and fear to West Bank as war rages,2023-12-06,BBC,By Jeremy Bowen,"A few nights ago, the school in Khirbet Zanuta, a small Palestinian village in the hills south of Hebron, was destroyed along with most of the houses, by a bulldozer.
Its tracks lay fresh and undisturbed in the sand when we arrived. The village was empty as its population of about 200 Palestinians left around a month ago, after sustained pressure and threats from armed and aggressive Jewish settlers who live in nearby outposts that are illegal under both Israeli and international law.
A twisted metal sign lies in the rubble of the school in Khirbet Zanuta. In bold black letters it reads ""Humanitarian Support to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank"". The sign records the donors who gave money to the project. The European Union was the lead donor and, among a panel of European development agencies, is also the coat of arms of the British royal family over the words British Consulate-General Jerusalem.
Nadav Weiman came with the BBC to the village. He is a former Israeli special forces soldier who is now an activist with Breaking the Silence, a group of former combatants who campaign against Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. Nadav believes that Jewish settlers, the most militant of whom are known by name to local Palestinians, were once again flouting the law with the police and army.
""They're demolishing Palestinian villages, beating up Palestinian farmers, stealing their olives, trying to open a third front, an eastern front against the Palestinians in the West Bank. Why? Because they want the land without Palestinians.""
Two Israeli soldiers came to investigate what we were doing. One of them told an Israeli member of the BBC team that he was a traitor for visiting Palestinians. They filmed us but took much less interest in what had happened in Khirbet Zanuta, a few miles down the road.
When I asked the police if they were investigating the flattening of the school and the village, they emailed back that they were waiting for a complaint. In fact, lawyers for Zanuta's Palestinians had petitioned Israel's Supreme Court.
In three days of travelling through the occupied West Bank, Palestinians have said consistently that since the war in Gaza started on 7 October, Jewish settlers are better armed and much more aggressive.
Violent attacks, including fatal shootings of Palestinians by armed Jewish settlers in the West Bank have risen sharply. So many attacks are happening that Israel's closest allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have condemned violence by extremist settlers and demanded that those guilty of crimes should be prosecuted.
In practice, settlers rarely end up in court and if they do, they can usually expect light sentences.
The settlers are armed and supported by powerful allies in the Israeli government, led by Itamar Ben Gvir, the minister for national security and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister who also has security responsibilities in the West Bank.
Controversially, Mr Smotrich just found more than $100 million for the settlers. Apparently referring to opinion polls saying Palestinians were supporting Hamas, he told The Times of Israel newspaper that ""there are two million Nazis in Judea and Samaria, who hate us exactly as do the Nazis of Hamas-ISIS in Gaza"". Judea and Samaria is a biblical term for the West Bank.
The reality of settler attacks was captured in a video taken by Muntassar Mhilat, a young Palestinian man from a family of Bedouins who live in the Judean desert not far from Jericho.
Their family home was invaded by about 20 violent, armed Jewish men. Muntassar filmed them yelling and pointing weapons.
""He was shooting at my uncle, so I ran down there and confronted him. We were pushing each other and screaming, head-to-head. And I was filming him. Then, around 20 settlers came.""
The video shows a settler loading his M-16 assault rifle and pointing it at the family. One of the women there, Umm Omar, carrying a month old baby, thought they were about to die.
""They attacked our house, stole our sheep, threatened my kids with guns and threatened me. Then they hit me and my husband's sister. I thought they were going to slaughter us.""
No-one was killed. The settlers accused them, falsely the family said, of stealing their goats. The man who pointed a loaded weapon was wearing a police jacket.
A common complaint is that settlers have been drafted into the security forces as reservists since 7 October and are abusing the power and position that come with the uniform and automatic weapons issued by the state.
The family recognised some of the attackers, as they came from an illegal outpost about a mile away. They know there will be a next time and feel sick with worry.
The harassment of Palestinians is also economic and psychological.
South of Hebron Palestinian farmers are ploughing with the donkey because local Jewish settlers have threatened to steal or break their tractor if they use it.
Almost at the other end of the West Bank, in a village outside Nablus called Burin, Ahmed Tirawi, a farmer looked across the valley at his olive trees, starting to rot because he has been forbidden by the local settlers to pick them.
""If I go up there on the hillside to harvest my olives, it's taking my life in my hands. The settlers make attacks on the farmers here - one bullet and they will kill me.""
The olive season is always a time of tension, but this time he said it has been ""horrible"".
""My feelings are more than anger. I feel humiliated by all of this. I am powerless to protect myself from just one settler. It's such a humiliation to be so alone and unable to protect yourself. The only solution is international law, two states and to protect people from the Israeli occupation.""
I went to talk to Yehuda Simon, a prominent settler leader at his own outpost, Havat Gilad, near Nablus. He is a lawyer who has represented settlers accused of attacking Palestinians, and he nodded approvingly when I said Palestinian farmers in the area near where he lived were being stopped from harvesting their olives.
""The army came to the conclusion that the Palestinians coming to harvest olives are gathering information in order to carry out an attack like on 7 October.""
He dismissed the repeated, documented reports of settlers attacking Palestinians.
""I don't hear about people who kill Palestinians. Okay. If the Palestinian just sits on his balcony and the settlers come and kill him, it's never happened. Okay. And I don't believe that the British and United States and all countries in the world, they are a friend of Israel… even Joe Biden is against Jewish people. He doesn't like Jewish people.""
As for the Arabs: ""They could stay here with us, but not try to kill us in the beginning.""
For more than a century, Arabs and Jews have been fighting over this small piece of land. The war in Gaza hasn't just increased violence in the West Bank. The way it ends, when it ends, will affect whether the next generation can escape this endless conflict.
The sight of families forced out of their homes raises memories of 1948 for Palestinians. By the time Israel won the battle for its independence, more than 700,000 Palestinians had either fled or been expelled from their homes at gunpoint. The new state took their property and never allowed them to go home. Palestinians call the events of 1948 the ""Nakba"" or catastrophe.
Settler violence and the loss of homes confirm, for Palestinians, their worst fears, that powerful forces in Israel's government and the settler movement want them out and are using the huge crisis surrounding the war in Gaza to make it happen.

Palestinian shot in back of head puts Israel's use of force under scrutiny,,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"The sound of a single gunshot echoes around the street as a man in a white t-shirt runs away from where an Israeli military jeep has been sighted.
In that instant, blood is seen spraying above him and he collapses forwards.
Ameed al-Jaghoub, unarmed and apparently rushing to help a wounded man, had been shot in the back of the head during an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank village of Beita.
Nearly a fortnight on, he remains critically ill in intensive care.
Mobile phone footage of the moment the 33-year-old was hit is among the clearest documentation in recent years of the use of lethal force by Israeli troops against an unarmed Palestinian.
His case is the latest to be highlighted by human rights groups, who say that casualty rates from what they describe as ""unjustified"" use of force are at their highest in two decades.
It comes with the West Bank engulfed in a crisis of violence involving a rising number of deadly attacks by Palestinians against Israelis, growing mob violence by Israeli settlers, and waves of lethal Israeli military raids into Palestinian cities.
Amid the clatter and grime of roadside car workshops, while children grapple to race an adult bike downhill, the street in Beita is still stained with blood. The village is depressingly familiar with the West Bank's epidemic of suffering.
Doctors say Mr Jaghoub may not survive. His family is praying for a ""miracle"" but knows if he lives, he will be severely brain damaged. ""This guy was hit to be killed,"" intensive care specialist Dr Sufwan Fayyad told the BBC.
Troops raided Beita on 21 August to detain a resident. According to locals, the forces believed the man's family could know clues as to the whereabouts of a gunman who days before had killed two Israelis - a father and son -at a carwash in the nearby town of Hawara.
That attack sparked a wave of military detentions and intelligence gathering raids as troops searched for the suspect, who remains at large.
Residents threw stones and broken masonry at armoured troop carriers as they entered.  Witnesses told the BBC that Israeli paramilitary border police officers exited a jeep that had stopped at the top of the street where Mr Jaghoub had joined a crowd of young men and teenagers.
As he ran away from the area where the troops were stationed, one shot him in the back of the head, said the witnesses.
In the footage, Mr Jaghoub is seen in the seconds before he is struck, heading towards a group lifting a wounded man onto a stretcher.
Earlier, a member of the police special forces had reportedly approached another resident, Mahmoud Elian, who says the officer told him to ""go and tell these children to get away from here because I'm here to kill"". He said the officer, who spoke to him in Hebrew, repeated the phrase twice.
Israel's Border Police did not respond to questions from the BBC about the claim.
Asked about Mr Jaghoub's case, the force did not answer questions about specifically why he was shot. In a statement, it said its troops faced a ""violent riot"" in Beita ""that endangered the lives of the security forces present"".
It said: ""As the riot increased, [so] did the level of response by the security forces. Additionally, the forces responded with .22 ammunition and live fire. Hits were identified.""
At the family home, Mr Jaghoub's toddler son Yanal is held by his grandfather. The family worries mostly for the children. Mr Jaghoub is an electrician, who often crossed the military checkpoints into Israel, where the pay can be up to five times that in the West Bank.
""This is a cruel and a cowardly act,"" Mr Jaghoub's father Ghaleb says. ""Because he was on his way to do a humanitarian act. He was not carrying a stone or a weapon or anything.""
""His children are young and do not realise what is happening, but they ask about him all the time,"" he tells the BBC.
His family says they have received calls from human rights groups based in Israel, as well as the Israeli media after footage of the shooting that has been circulated widely on social media. But they doubt it will make any difference.
Despite reviews into similar incidents being announced by Israeli forces, the overwhelming majority of cases do not lead to prosecutions or meaningful accountability.
In Mr Jaghoub's case, the US State Department, which has become unusually outspoken over some Israeli actions in the West Bank, particularly in light ofgrowing settler violence, said it was ""alarmed"" by the report of ""an Israeli shooting an unarmed Palestinian civilian from behind as the latter was walking away from an Israeli position"". It called for a thorough investigation and ""full accountability"".
Mr Jaghoub's brother Said, who has been making daily trips to his bedside, says: ""The world will do nothing for us. We always appeal to the international community, but unfortunately the Israeli attacks are increasing.""
Beita found itself at the heart of the West Bank's escalating violence in May 2021, when an Israeli settler group established the nearby outpost of Evyatar, cutting off the Palestinian village from part of its lands.
The settlers built the outpost in apparent retribution for the murder of Yehuda Guetta, a 19-year-old yeshiva student, who was shot dead by a Palestinian-American who came from a town 20km (12 miles) away from Beita.
All settlements are illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. But outposts like Evyatar, which often involve taking privately-owned Palestinian land, are also illegal under Israeli law.
In the year after Evyatar's establishment, Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians, eight of them from Beita, during weekly protests against the outpost, according to the Israel-based human rights group B'Tselem.
The village has already ""paid a massive price"" for the growth of illegal settlement outposts in the Nablus region, says Sarit Michaeli, international advocacy officer at the organisation.
Likening it to the demonstrations around Beita, she puts Mr Jaghoub's shooting down to the use of ""open fire regulations"" by Israeli forces.
""It's important to stress this is not an isolated incident… We're talking about a broad policy that is the use of lethal force,"" she says.
""The fact that some people were throwing stones [and] the claim that soldiers or border police officers were involved in some sort of clash with Palestinians doesn't simply allow them the authority to shoot an unarmed person in the head,"" she said.
Under international law, the use of firearms by security forces against civilians is defined as a measure of last resort and can only take place to stop an ""imminent threat of death or serious injury"".
Israel routinely rejects the accusations by rights groups, saying its forces operate to protect Israeli civilians and lethal force is necessary against what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called a current ""terror wave"" in the West Bank.
At least 220 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and 33 Israelis have been killed since the start of this year.

Israeli flags 'forcibly' removed from Sheffield and Rotherham town halls,,BBC,"By Tom Airey, Hayley Coyle & Victoria Scheer","Protesters have removed Israeli flags flying above two South Yorkshire town halls.
Footage shared on social media showed a man on the roof of Sheffield Town Hall on Tuesday, removing the banner and replacing it with a Palestinian flag.
The flag outside Rotherham Town Hall was also ""forcibly"" removed and the flag pole damaged, the council said.
South Yorkshire's mayor Oliver Coppard condemned the acts, saying they did not ""reflect the values of the region"".
In a statement South Yorkshire Police said it believed two men had scaled Sheffield Town Hall on Tuesday evening.
In the clip,shared by Sheffield Online, people could be heard shouting ""take it down"" and cheering as the Israeli flag was lowered in Sheffield.
Officers attempted to disperse crowds, with two suspects ""fleeing the scene"" during the ""minor disorder"".
No arrests had been made, a force spokesperson added.
The force confirmed it had also received reports of the theft of a flag and ""minor damage"" to a flagpole at Rotherham Town Hall and investigations into both incidents were ""ongoing"".
They happened three days afterdozens of armed fighters from Hamas- the Palestinian militant group - crossed into Israel from Gaza in a surprise attack.
The death toll in Israel has reached 1,200 - while more than 900 people have been killed by retaliatoryIsraeli air strikes on Gaza.
Sheffield City Council leader Tom Hunt said: ""Everyone has the right to safe and peaceful protest but we cannot support the events that took place during the protest outside Sheffield's Town Hall.
""Protesters put themselves and others in serious danger.""
The decision to fly the Israeli flag was made after a request from central government, both Sheffield City Council and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council said.
The local authorities added that the ""show of solidarity"" had been due to end at 20:00 BST, with the Union flag put back on the buildings afterwards.
Sheffield City Council confirmed a ""full review"" of the incident would take place and ""we will look at the security measures that were in place"".
Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council said it had reported the incident to South Yorkshire Police.
Discussing the actions of those who were on the roof in Sheffield, Mr Hunt added: ""We are a city of sanctuary, and this is not what we stand for.
""There are strong feelings about the situation in Israel and Palestine but we ask everyone to show respect and tolerance at this time.""
Meanwhile, Sheffield South East MP Clive Betts told the BBC the incident was ""disappointing"".
He added: ""I absolutely and utterly condemn the Hamas attack on innocent people.
""We have to look for long-term solutions to stop this violence. It's a two-state solution - but we don't seem to get anywhere near it.""
South Yorkshire's mayor Oliver Coppard said the Israeli flag being removed from the council buildings did not ""reflect the values of the region I know"".
""We are a place of compassion, a place that supports and respects our minority communities, and a place where we respect each other,"" he said.
Mr Coppard shared his plans to work with faith and community leaders as well as the police to ""bring together our communities"" and ""to help us move forward"".
He added: ""We will do so in solidarity with the people of Israel, and those at risk in Gaza, those grieving, worried for their loved ones, and those scared about what is to come.""

Did Iran support plan for attack on Israel?,2023-10-09,BBC,By Paul Adams,"Questions about the involvement of Israel's arch-enemy Iran are already being asked in the wake of the deadly assault by Hamas on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip.
A report in the Wall Street Journal quotes unnamed members of Hamas and the Lebanese guerrilla movement Hezbollah as saying that Iran gave the go-ahead for the attack a week ago.
But a senior defence official in Washington later said that the US had ""no information at this time"" to corroborate specific allegations of an Iranian role in the attacks.
Regardless, the stakes on the truth of this are high. If it emerged that Iran was behind the attacks, it could widen the conflict into a regional confrontation.
So while Iran's leaders have celebrated and praised the attacks, they have been quick to deny involvement.
""The accusations linked to an Iranian role… are based on political reasons,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry said.
Iran did not intervene ""in the decision-making of other countries"", a spokesman added.
But none of this means Iran wasn't involved.
The US says it had ""not yet"" seen evidence Iran was behind the attacks. However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that ""there is certainly a long relationship"".
Tehran has been one of Hamas' main sponsors for many years, providing it with financial assistance and vast quantities of weaponry, including rockets.
Israel has spent years trying to disrupt Iran's supply routes to Gaza, which involve Sudan, Yemen, ships in the Red Sea and Bedouin smugglers in the lawless Sinai Peninsula.
As one of Israel's most implacable foes, Iran clearly has a vested interest in seeing the Jewish state suffer.
""I would say that it's not too much to assume that Iran is involved,"" Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, told the BBC.
""This is the response of Iran to reports that a peace treaty is going to happen between Israel and Saudi Arabia.""
But Mr Tomer said he found the suggestion that Iran actually ordered Saturday's attack ""a little bit cumbersome"".
""Yes, it's true that Iran is the number one provider of equipment to Hamas,"" he said, ""and that they were training them in Syria and even, reportedly, in Iran.""
Israel, he said, had been watching the movement of Hamas officials in recent months.
""We have seen people like Saleh al-Arouri (head of the organisation's military wing) and other Hamas leaders flying back and forth between Lebanon and Iran, holding meetings, including with [Supreme Leader Ayatollah] Khamenei himself.""
But this ""intimate relationship"" was not enough, Mr Tomer said, to explain the timing of the attack.
""Hamas was very much tuned to the inner conflict in Israel,"" he said.
""Iran sustains and supports every logistic and military aspect, but I think the decision was at least 75% an independent decision by the Hamas leadership.""
Raz Zimmt, an Iran expert at Tel Aviv University, agrees.
""This is a Palestinian story,"" he posted on social media today.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Iran gave the green light for the attack at a meeting in Beirut last Monday.
Unnamed Hamas and Hezbollah sources told the newspaper that officers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had worked alongside Hamas since August to put together Saturday's complex air, land and sea operation.
Videos of the Hamas attack pointed to a level of sophistication far beyond the organisation's mostly crude attempts in the past to breach Israel's security fence surrounding the Gaza Strip.
The simultaneous use of rockets, drones, vehicles and powered hang-gliders suggested that the operation's planners had studied other recent examples of hybrid warfare, perhaps including Ukraine.
But the decision to attack, Mr Raz said, was taken ""by Hamas, based on its own interests, arising from the Palestinian reality"".
""Did Hamas use Iranian aid? Definitely, yes. Did Iran have an interest in this action? Yes. Does Hamas need Iranian permission to operate? No.""
Hamas has been developing its elite units for several years, says Haim Tomer, the former Mossad official.
""But still they performed above their former level,"" he said.
Israeli officials are now looking north and south as they figure out what happens next and whether Iran's involvement could become more overt.
Iran's Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, has already launched two small-scale attacks into the Israel-occupied Golan Heights. The Israeli military says it has used helicopters to hit targets inside Lebanon.
""The Hamas operation is a reality-changing event in the Middle East that may oblige Iran to move from the phase of ongoing support and co-ordination to a more direct involvement, especially if the Israeli response poses a significant challenge to Hamas,"" Mr Raz said.

Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on Gaza,,BBC,By Iain Watson,"In his speech on Gaza, Sir Keir Starmer sought to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict by focusing, in part, on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a viable Palestinian state existing side by side.
This is in line with the Labour leader's oft-stated aversion to short-term fixes and ""sticking plaster politics"" - the Middle East's problems, he argued, have not received enough attention from the international community.
Conveniently, this position allowed him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli PM, Benjamin Netanyahu.
It also allowed him to stress that there was widespread agreement in his own party on the longer term goal.
But his speech didn't - and couldn't - ignore not just the current conflict in the Middle East but the conflict in his own ranks.
And he is facing considerable jeopardy.
He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.
He explained why he is backing a humanitarian ""pause"" - in line with the EU and US, to allow for more aid - rather than a ceasefire, which he said would embolden Hamas and allow them to plan future attacks.
But crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks was tolerant - saying that he understood what was driving them.
He may have little choice in this, as otherwise he'd have to sack 14 shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.
His tone towards the Israeli government was also more sceptical.
He denounced illegal settlements in the West Bank, and said Israel's right to self defence was not a ""blank cheque"".
While he signalled that pro-ceasefire frontbenchers seemed to be safe from the sack, Sir Keir, of course,suspendedthe former shadow minister Andy McDonald from the parliamentary party - which has outraged the left.
But the bigger danger is that by not straying from his opposition to a ceasefire - at least ""at this stage"" - some shadow ministers beyond the left come under renewed pressure from members and communities to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.
So far the policy of engaging with, rather than eradicating, dissent has maintained a degree of unity.
And no-one in any of the top positions in the party has strayed from the leader's line.
But the situation in the wider party is volatile - and opponents will be keen to highlight any divisions.
So the reaction to Tuesday's speech will be important.
It will determine whether a fragile unity can be maintained, or if it will splinter or shatter.

Amnesty: Possible war crimes in recent Israel-Gaza fighting,2023-06-13,BBC,By David Gritten,"War crimes were possibly committed during last month's fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, Amnesty International says.
A report by the human rights groupconcludes that Israeli forces conducted apparently disproportionate air strikes which killed Palestinian civilians.
It also says indiscriminate Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) rocket fire killed both Israeli and Palestinian civilians.
Amnesty is calling on the International Criminal Court to investigate.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operated in accordance with its obligations under international law and made efforts to minimize harm to civilians that were not required by law.
A spokesman for PIJ said the group welcomed Amnesty's report.
Thirty-four Palestinians and one Israeli were killed in the latest round of cross-border fighting, which erupted on 9 May and ended five days later with an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire.
It began when Israeli warplanes carried out overnight air strikes that killed three senior commanders of PIJ's military wing in their homes as well as 10 civilians, including relatives and neighbours of the men.
Amnesty International said the dropping of precision-guided bombs on densely-populated areas when families were sleeping suggested ""that those who planned and authorised the attacks anticipated - and likely disregarded - the disproportionate harm to civilians"".""Intentionally launching disproportionate attacks... is a war crime,"" it warned.
The IDF said that during the fighting which followed, its aircraft struck more than 400 military targets belonging to PIJ and killed three other senior commanders of its military wing, which it blamed for the firing of dozens of rockets and mortars at Israel the previous week.
Amnesty investigated nine strikes, including those that targeted the three PIJ commanders in their homes.
The IDF said it ""made numerous efforts to minimise harm to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip, including by delaying and even cancelling planned attacks when unexpected presence of civilians was identified"".
""The IDF carried out attacks only after a real-time assessment before the attack that the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property will not be excessive in relation to the military advantage anticipated in the attack, according to the information it had in the circumstances,"" it added.
Amnesty also said it ""identified a pattern of extensive destruction of property"" in Gaza as a result of the Israeli strikes that ""failed to meet the exceptions under which attacking homes and other civilian objects would be justified"".
It cited the targeting on 13 May of a four-storey building in the Jabaliya refugee camp that washome to 42 people from the extended Nabhan family.
Amnesty found no evidence that the building had been used to store weapons or any other military equipment, or that rockets had been launched nearby.
""In our investigation, we heard vivid accounts of bombs obliterating homes, of fathers digging their little girls out from under rubble, of a teenager fatally injured as she lay in bed holding a teddy bear,"" said Amnesty's Middle East director Heba Morayef.
""More frightening than any of this is the near certainty that, unless perpetrators are held to account, these horrifying scenes will be repeated.""
The IDF said: ""Islamic Jihad locates its operational centres in civilian residential buildings and uses the civilian population as a human shield.
""Several hours prior to strikes, the IDF ensured that the buildings were evacuated from civilians by various means, such as telephone calls and the 'roof-knocking' procedure. These buildings were not attacked until they were fully evacuated of civilian population.""
PIJ responded to the Israeli strikes by firing more than 1,400 rockets towards Israel, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to take cover in bomb shelters.
The IDF says 1,139 crossed into Israeli territory in total and that about 430 headed for populated areas were intercepted by its missile defence systems.
An Israeli woman and a Palestinian labourer from Gaza were killed by rockets that hit an apartment in Rehovot and a building site in Shokeda respectively.
Amnesty says rockets that fell short in Gaza also appear to have killed three Palestinian civilians, including two children.
The report cites relatives of the children as saying they died when a rocket hit al-Sahaba street in Gaza City on the afternoon of 10 May.
PIJ denied at the time that a rocket hit the area and blamed Israeli strikes, but witnesses told a researcher that individuals associated with the group removed remnants of a rocket in the immediate aftermath of the incident.
""Known for their inherent inaccuracy, rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups are indiscriminate; these attacks must be investigated as war crimes and victims be granted prompt and adequate redress,"" Ms Morayef said.
PIJ spokesman Tariq Salmi did not comment on that allegation.
But he told the BBC that Amnesty's report ""proves that the occupation [Israel] was the one that began the aggression by committing grave crimes"".
""The enemy uses the weapons it has to kill Palestinian civilians and we are doing our part to defend ourselves against the crimes committed by Israel against the Palestinian people,"" he added.

"Untreated diseases could kill more than bombings in Gaza, WHO warns",,BBC,By David Gritten,"Untreated diseases could eventually kill more people in Gaza than bombings if the health system is not restored, the World Health Organization says.
Diarrhoea and respiratory infections are widespread among children in overcrowded UN facilities where almost 1.1 million people are sheltering.
Patients with chronic illnesses like cancer are also receiving no treatment.
The warning comes as a truce between Israel and Hamas entered a fifth day, after a 48-hour extension was agreed.
The deal mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States should see an additional 20 Israeli women and children held hostage in Gaza being released in exchange for 60 Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli prisons.
On Monday, 11 hostages and 33 prisoners were freed on the fourth and final day of the initial agreement, bringing the totals to 50 hostages and 150 prisoners released.
Nineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.
The UN estimates that more than 1.8 million people in Gaza have fled their homes over the past seven weeks. About 60% of them are sheltering in 156 facilities belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.
WHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told a news conference in Geneva that an assessment of those shelters had found outbreaks of infectious diseases, with cases of diarrhoea among children aged five and older more than 100 times normal levels by early November.
No treatment is available for them, she said, without which infants in particular can deteriorate and die very quickly.
According to the UN, only five hospitals are partially operational in the north of Gaza, the area that has been the focus of the Israeli ground offensive.
Eight of the 11 hospitals are functional in the south, where the Israeli military has ordered civilians to flee. Only one of those hospitals has the capacity to treat critical trauma cases or perform complex surgery.
""Eventually, we will see more people dying from disease than we are even seeing from the bombardment if we are not able to put back [together] this health system,"" Dr Harris warned.
Addressing journalists via video link from Gaza, Unicef spokesman James Elder reported seeing hospitals full of children with horrendous war wounds.
He described seeing one child missing part of his leg lying untreated on a hospital floor for several hours because of a lack of medical staff. Other injured children were lying in car parks and gardens outside, he said.
Displaced children and their families are also suffering because of a lack of proper shelter and clothing to protect them from the rainy and cold weather currently in Gaza.
Over the first four days of the truce, 800 aid lorries entered Gaza, with some reaching the north, according to US officials. That is an increase in comparison to the preceding few days, but it is still just a fraction of the usual number.
The UN agencies say that in such conditions, a resumption in fighting should be unthinkable, they are calling again for a permanent ceasefire.
Israel's prime minister has promised that its military will ""go to realising our goals with full force"" when the pause ends.
However, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it would use the extension to seek a ""sustainable truce that would lead to further negotiations and eventually an end... to this war"".
""We are working with what we have. And what we have right now is the provision to the agreement that allows us to extend days as long as Hamas is able to guarantee the release of at least 10 hostages,"" spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha.
He added that mediators hoped to receive information from Hamas about the more than 150 Israelis and foreign nationals still being held hostage, who include children as young as 10 months old as well as a number of soldiers.
A senior Hamas source in Qatar told the BBC that not all of the civilian hostages were in its hands. Some were with smaller armed groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers.
According to the source, Hamas needs more time to collect information and contact people. Communication is very difficult because of the damage to the telecoms network and the shortage of fuel to power it.
Mr Ansari also said only ""minimal breaches"" of the truce had been reported.
But two hours after he spoke the Israeli military said three explosive devices had been detonated near its troops in two different locations in northern Gaza in violation of the agreement.
""In one of the locations, terrorists also opened fire at the troops, who responded with fire. A number of soldiers were lightly injured during the incidents,"" it added.
Hamas's military wing said there had been ""friction"" in the north and that its fighters had dealt with an ""clear breach"" of the truce deal by Israeli troops.
Gunfire and explosions were earlier reported in north-western Gaza City.
A local journalist told the BBC that dozens of displaced people were trying to return to their houses in the Sheikh Radwan area when they approached Israeli army positions, and that an Israeli tank and troops fired warning shots. One person was wounded and a building was hit by a shell, they said.

Rare Israeli drone strike kills Palestinian militants in West Bank,2023-06-22,BBC,By David Gritten,"Three Palestinian militants have been killed in a rare Israeli drone strike in the occupied West Bank, amid escalating violence in the territory.
The Israeli military said it targeted ""a terrorist cell inside a suspicious vehicle"" that carried out a shooting attack near Jalama on Wednesday night.
It was the first such strike in the West Bank since 2006, it added.
Palestinian first responders said they found three bodies in a burned-out car but soldiers prevented their removal.
Palestinian news agency Wafa identified themas Mohammed Bashar Uweis, 28, Suhayb Adnan al-Ghoul, 27, and Ashraf Murad Saadi, 17, and said they were all from the city of Jenin.
The militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said Ghoul and Saadi were its fighters, while Uweis was from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, the armed wing of the Fatah movement.
PIJ warned Israel's leaders that they would ""bear responsibility for their stupid decision to strike these operatives with drones and... keep their bodies"".
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant tweeted: ""We'll take an attacking and proactive approach against terror, we'll use all means at our disposal and exact the heaviest price from every terrorist.""
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its soldiers identified a vehicle carrying gunmen who had carried out a shooting at a checkpoint near Jalama, a town about 3.5km (2 miles) north of Jenin.
""The terrorist cell [had] carried out a number of shooting attacks toward communities in Judea and Samaria lately,"" it added, using the biblical term that Israel uses to refer to the West Bank.
""Following the identification of the terrorist cell, an IDF UAV [Unmanned Aerial Vehicle] fired toward the cell and thwarted them.""
Witnesses said they heard gunfire shortly before the strike.
""After the sound of the bullets, I was sitting with my children and we decided to go inside because we thought there were clashes or something like that,"" resident Nasser Torokman told Reuters news agency.
""Later on, we heard a sound of a strong explosion. The first rocket fell and I saw that there was fire in the area and a burning car.""
Video footage posted on social media showed what appeared to beseveral emergency vehicles near the burning wreck of the car targeted in the strike.
The drone strike came hours after a Palestinian man was shot dead during a rampage by hundreds of Israeli settlers who torched homes and cars in the town of Turmusaya, about 50km to the south.
The Palestinian health ministry said the man was shot dead by Israeli forces ""while confronting the settlers"". Israel's paramilitary border police said its forces were securing firefighters when residents ""rioted"" and troops fired at a man who shot at them.
The attack on Turmusaya followed the funeral in a nearby settlement a 17-year-old boy who was among four Israelis shot dead by two Palestinian gunmen from Hamas at a petrol station and restaurant on Tuesday.
Hamas, in turn, said that shooting was a response to an Israeli military raid in Jenin on Monday during which seven Palestinians were killed.
It saw the IDF's first use of an Apache attack helicopter in the West Bank in years. The helicopter fired missiles at militants who had targeted troop carriers with explosives, wounding seven soldiers.

How delay to Israel offensive benefits US,2023-10-26,BBC,By Barbara Plett Usher,"The Israeli prime minister's ambiguous announcement of a Gaza ground invasion suits the United States - and is almost certainly influenced by it.
Benjamin Netanyahu gave no timeline for the offensive, but CBS, the BBC's US partner, has learned that it's been delayed.
Washington has been coy about its role, but clear about the advantages of taking more time.
US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he'd suggested that, if possible, Mr Netanyahu should wait until Hamas released more hostages, ""but I did not demand it"".
His comment encapsulates the US approach to Israel's war with the Palestinian militant group - full support for its determination to eradicate Hamas after an unprecedented attack on Israeli civilians earlier this month, alongside concerns about the consequences of its response.
The administration certainly wants to take full advantage of any window of opportunity to free Hamas captives, which will likely be closed when Israeli ground troops move into Gaza.
There are more than 200 hostages, including some Americans. The release of four in recent days has raised hopes that others could follow.
But for the Pentagon the paramount concern is rushing defensive systems into the region following attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria by Iran-backed militias.
This has increased concerns of a regional escalation once the Gaza invasion begins, and the US is using the delay to shore up protection for its interests.
The State Department has already authorised the departure of non-essential staff from embassies in Iraq and Lebanon, the latter the base of the powerful Hezbollah movement, which has been exchanging cross-border rocket fire with Israel.
It's also developing contingency plans for a wider evacuation of US citizens in the region should it be deemed necessary.
In the meantime, it's been engaged in the most intensive round of diplomacy since Mr Biden took office, after Secretary of State Antony Blinken conducted a whirlwind tour of the Middle East to try and prevent a wider flare-up.
And at the United Nations, a resolution drafted by the US sums up its evolving approach to the conflict.
The humanitarian catastrophe caused by the Israeli siege on Gaza has tempered administration rhetoric about Israel's ""obligation"" to deal a punishing blow to Hamas.
""We solicited input,"" said the United States UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. ""We listened. We engaged with all [Security] Council members to incorporate edits, including language on humanitarian pauses and the protection of civilians fleeing conflict.""
Nevertheless, the resolution was vetoed by Russia and China because, they said, it didn't call for a ceasefire.
America's Arab allies - Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan, the UAE and the Palestinian Authority - lined up to call for a halt to the fighting, after a day-long Security Council meeting dominated by demands for a ceasefire.
Many of them are no fans of Hamas, and some may want to see it defeated, but Israel's blockade and bombardment of Gaza is shaping their response.
However, a ceasefire right now ""only benefits Hamas"", said White House spokesman, John Kirby.
And although the resolution contains robust language about the need to respect international law, the State Department has not made a formal determination on whether Israel is in fact doing so, as part of its intense bombing campaign it says is aimed at destroying Hamas infrastructure.
The air strikes have demolished whole neighbourhoods in Gaza City and killed more than 7,000 civilians, a third of them children, says the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.
President Biden has cast doubt on these numbers, prompting the ministry to retort with a detailed list of people it said had been killed in the war.
Amidst Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza it's impossible to independently verify Palestinian casualty figures. But the UN cites them, as has the State Department for previous conflicts.
The department's Spokesman Matthew Miller maintained that Israel was hitting ""legitimate military targets that are embedded in civilian infrastructure"", adding that the US was trying to establish safe zones for civilians inside Gaza.
There hasn't been any word of progress with that. But the Americans have been able to open a trickle of aid into Gaza through its border with Egypt and are working around the clock to widen it.
Mr Biden appointed a veteran diplomat, David Satterfield, to the task. He's also trying to organise the departure of Palestinians with US citizenship, and other foreign nationals.
""You can imagine how complicated it is,"" says a State Department Spokesperson. ""We're dealing with Israel, Egypt, and Hamas, and we're not talking directly to Hamas.""
""It's like a puzzle, where you unlock a layer that can unlock one little piece of it. And then another obstacle pops up and you've got to go figure out with all the parties, how to unlock that piece.""
It is not clear what will happen to this nascent humanitarian corridor once the ground invasion begins. But Washington has been pressing Israel on its strategy and tactics.
It has dispatched US military officers who have experienced urban combat in Iraq to ask ""some of the hard questions that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] should consider as they plan various scenarios,"" says Pentagon Spokesperson Brig Gen Patrick Ryder, ""including advice on mitigating civilian casualties.""
Along with very real concerns about a spiralling conflict, the US is probably attempting to reposition itself after its initial ""one-sided response"" in support of Israel provoked criticism, says Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard University.
""It's very likely they're aware that this conflict is not playing well for the United States or for Israel in the rest of the world,"" he says. ""In much of the Global South we're seen as deeply hypocritical, actively opposing Russian occupation in Ukraine, for all the right reasons, and doing very little about Israeli occupation [of the Palestinians] over a 50-, 60-year period.""
The administration has been clear that it sees the scale and brutality of this Hamas attack, killing more than 1,400 people, as different from others in the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
But its intensive engagement suggests it fears that even if Israel wins the battle against Hamas, when it comes to public opinion and regional costs, it may lose the war.

Shireen Abu Aqla: Al Jazeera reporter's family still hope for justice,,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"The brother of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Aqla says his family is still being denied justice while her killers enjoy ""impunity"".
The veteran Al Jazeera correspondent was shot dead during an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank last May.
Her brother Tony Abu Aqla spoke to the BBC as events take place to mark the first anniversary of her killing.
He says it is ""depressing"" that a US-led investigation could be hampered by an Israeli refusal to co-operate.
""We still have lots of hope it will be achieved [but] it's not easy. For us, they are the criminals. They are the ones who targeted Shireen,"" he says.
""And from day one, they've been trying to cover up this killing by releasing several narratives that were old, were fake, trying to elude justice,"" he adds.
Shireen Abu Aqla's reporting on the conflict and the impact of Israel's military occupation on Palestinians' everyday lives was known to a generation of viewers who grew up watching her. Her death resonated across the Middle East.
The following days saw the biggest crowds in Jerusalem for a Palestinian funeral in decades, and in scenes condemned internationally, Israeli border police beat and kicked coffin-bearers and used stun grenades to push back mourners.
The journalist was shot dead in Jenin refugee camp by Israeli troops stationed around 650ft (200m) from where she and other journalists were preparing to work, according to evidence and eyewitness accounts. She was wearing a helmet and a clearly marked blue ""press"" vest.
The Israeli military has previously said it is ""highly probable"" its forces killed her during an operation against armed militants. But it said it was ""unintentional"" and therefore no further inquiry would take place.
The journalist's family has since pressed US authorities to carry out their own investigation and called for soldiers involved to be held to account.
In November the Israeli government said the US Department of Justice had opened an inquiry, alongside reports the FBI was involved. But Israel's defence ministry said it would not co-operate and would ""not allow interference in Israel's internal affairs"".
The family has welcomed the US investigation but says the government has not done enough given Ms Abu Aqla was an American citizen.
""We didn't receive the support we were expecting and anticipated to receive from them,"" said Mr Abu Aqla.
""It's not easy trying to get justice when it's Israel. Unfortunately, they enjoy this impunity and maybe this is the time to end this impunity and the double standards exercised on Israel,"" he said.
""Every time we see an Israeli soldier, we believe this is the one who killed Shireen,"" he added.
The Israeli army raid was one of many during a spate of deadly Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis, some involving perpetrators from Jenin.
The anniversary comes in the same week as a reporters' safety watchdog found Israeli forces had killed at least 20 journalists since 2001in cases showing a pattern of ""inadequate responses that evade accountability"". Israel rejected its findings.
Among other attempts to investigate the journalist's death is a submission of evidence to the International Criminal Court, backed by the family and her employer Al Jazeera.
Speaking at his sister's graveside in Jerusalem, Mr Abu Aqla said the family had had ""amazing"" support from people and that it had given them ""lots of comfort"".
""People would know Shireen more than any politician. She was just a simple reporter. Shireen was in every Palestinian home,"" he said.
""Hopefully, by achieving justice it will give us at least some relief,"" he said.

Gaza cancer patients face life-threatening treatment delays,2023-05-13,BBC,By Yolande Knell in Jerusalem & Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza Strip,"Five days into the worst fighting in months between Israel and militant groups in Gaza, concern is mounting about the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory.
It is estimated that more than 200 patients, mostly with cancer, are unable to leave for urgently needed treatment. They include children.
Israel controls two crossings with Gaza - used for people and goods - which have been closed since the start of its military operation on Tuesday.
Operators of the sole power plant in the impoverished strip - which relies on Israeli fuel imports - say it will be forced to close in three days.
A spokesman told the BBC this would ""lead to an exacerbation of the humanitarian problems"". The plant supplies about half of the electricity in the territory, where some 2.3 million Palestinians live.
A British surgeon who is among an estimated 140 humanitarian workers currently stranded in Gaza says cancer patients are facing potentially life-threatening delays.
Prof Nick Maynard, a consultant surgeon at Oxford University Hospitals, arrived in Gaza City last week as part of an aid programme teaching advanced cancer surgery to Palestinian doctors.
""The doctors I work with here have got multiple examples of people who are in desperate need of cancer treatment,"" Prof Maynard told the BBC.
""These treatments are undoubtedly being delayed and potentially leading to deaths because of the delays now,"" he added.
Prof Maynard said he was one of about a dozen non-resident British nationals stuck in Gaza.
Ziyad al-Za'noun, 70, has cancer of the spinal cord and is treated every week at Istishari Hospital in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.
""I have been suffering from cancer for three years and there is no treatment for it here in Gaza,"" he said.
""On Tuesday, I was scheduled to go for a chemotherapy session in Ramallah, but we were surprised by the closure of Erez crossing.
""My health condition is getting worse, and I am using painkillers to overcome the pain, and my psychological condition is also deteriorating,"" Ziyad al-Za'noun added.
Israel tightened its blockade of Gaza in 2007 after it was taken over by the Islamist militant group Hamas, citing security concerns.
Hamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and is designated as a terrorist group by Israel and many other countries.
Gaza's hospitals face severe shortages of medical equipment and medicines largely due to the blockade, but also because of internal Palestinian political divisions.
Many cancer patients need to leave for medical treatment; they have to apply for Israeli permits to exit via the Erez crossing.  Most of those who get these are transferred to Augusta Victoria Hospital in occupied East Jerusalem.
More than 90 patients - six of them children with cancer - were due to arrive there in the past week but could not travel, according to Dr Fadi al-Atrash, the hospital's chief executive.
""There is always a need to refer patients primarily to Augusta Victoria and even other hospitals in the West Bank,"" Dr Fadi said.
""It's because of the lack of services in Gaza, lack of drugs, human resources and appropriate infrastructure.""
When the current hostilities end, patients and relatives accompanying them will have to apply for new Israeli permits to leave Gaza.
""When the checkpoints are open, there will be another process for permits. More time will be taken to arrange their exit from Gaza to the hospital and that will add to the delay in their treatment that they have suffered from in the past week,"" Dr Fadi said.
Already Gaza's power plant is reducing the amount of electricity it generates, to try to save its fuel reserves. If it shuts down, this will have an impact on many different services.
""Preventing the entry of fuel shipments threatens it with a complete stop and will prevent the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company from supplying vital facilities such as hospitals, waste pumps and treatment plants, potable water wells and desalination plants,"" said Muhammad Thabet, a spokesman for the company.
Normally, some 300 lorryloads of goods enter Gaza each day through the Kerem Shalom commercial crossing with Israel.
In past conflicts, there would have been serious food shortages after several days of closure. However, recently Egypt has eased its tight restrictions on the Palestinian territory, which means food and other goods are continuing to enter.
For now, supermarkets still have stocks of basic items - but many shelves are empty, prompting shoppers to form long queues as they start stockpiling.
Israel's military-run authority that controls entry into Gaza said its crossings had been under the constant threat of rocket fire and remained shut this week.
The Israeli defence ministry said on Saturday that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) militants had fired dozens of mortars at Erez and Kerem Shalom since Tuesday.
It also posted what it said was security camera footage showing a blast caused by a mortar fired at Erez.
But the first day of Israel's airstrikes witnessed no Palestinian fire and there have also been several lulls in the fighting.
While Egypt is continuing to try to mediate a ceasefire, the intense barrages of Palestinian rockets and Israeli air strikes and shelling have brought normal life to a halt for millions of ordinary people.
In Israel, some 1.5 million people have been told to stay close to or in a bomb shelter.  Schools and many businesses in the south of the country are closed.
In Ashkelon, one self-employed resident said she had had no income in the past week and nor had her husband, a shop owner whose store has been closed.
Israeli air defence systems have not been able to intercept all of the hundreds of rockets fired.  One woman has been killed and several people have been injured.  A number of buildings have been damaged.
In Gaza, some 33 people have been killed - about half of them civilians - including women and children. Houses and apartments have been destroyed or damaged.
On Friday, the UN said 417 people from about 73 families had been internally displaced.
The UN has raised concerns about how the fighting is worsening the humanitarian situation in Gaza - where more than half the population lives in poverty.

Why Egypt remains reluctant to open Rafah crossing to Gaza,,BBC,By Sebastian Usher,"Egypt has long played a role as a mediator in the conflict not just between Israel and the Palestinians, but also between the main Palestinian factions themselves.
It was the first Arab state to make peace with Israel back in 1978 - after fighting several wars with the Jewish state.
Now, the focus is on Egypt's control of one of the two land routes out of the Gaza Strip - the Rafah crossing.
Thousands of Palestinians are waiting on the Gaza side of the border, while hundreds of lorries carrying desperately needed aid are parked up on the Egyptian side. Many more aid convoys are also heading towards the border.
But there has still been no deal on opening the crossing, which has also reportedly been hit by several Israeli strikes in the past few days.
Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told the BBC's Newshour programme that from Egypt's perspective, ""the Rafah crossing on our side is officially open"", but he blamed ""aerial bombardments"" for making the crossing ""inaccessible"" and unsafe for aid lorries to cross into Gaza.
But Cairo has kept tight restrictions on movement through the Rafah crossing for many years - to such an extent that many Palestinians have essentially accused Egypt of bolstering Israel's blockade of Gaza, which has been in place since Hamas took full power there in 2007.
The restrictions have mostly been about security concerns in North Sinai where the Egyptian authorities have long been involved in a deadly conflict with jihadists linked to Al Qaeda.
But Egypt's apparent reluctance to open the crossing without clear conditions and guarantees may be more about trying to avoid a mass exodus of Palestinians from Gaza.
The UN's humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, says the Egyptian authorities fear a great influx of Gazans - for whom they would then be responsible, for an indefinite period.
In addition, Egypt does not want to play any role in what could amount to a permanent resettlement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza.
It seems prepared to allow foreigners and Palestinians with dual nationality to leave, but it wants this to be dependent on allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza.
A further stumbling block is that Israel seems to want pretty much the opposite - to allow more Palestinians to leave than Egypt is prepared to accept, while limiting the amount of aid that could go in.
Reflecting Egypt's position, Mr Shoukry told the BBC: ""It's not a matter of transferring the responsibility to Egypt - it is a matter of maintaining the safety and well-being of Gazans on their own territory.""
He has also said the Israeli government has not yet adopted a position that would allow the crossing to be opened.
Diplomatic efforts are intensifying to try to resolve the impasse, as aid agencies warn that the situation in Gaza is edging closer to a humanitarian catastrophe.

Children among 17 Britons dead or missing in Israel,2023-10-11,BBC,By Michael Sheils McNamee,"Seventeen British nationals, including children, are dead or missing after the Hamas attack on Israel, an official UK source has told the BBC.
It is an increase on the previous estimate of""more than 10"".
The death toll in Israel has reached 1,200, with more than 900 people killed by Israeli air strikes on Gaza.
Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has travelled to Israel, with the Foreign Office saying the visit was to meet survivors and outline UK support.
A Foreign Office spokesperson said Mr Cleverly was in Israel ""to demonstrate the UK's unwavering solidarity with the Israeli people following Hamas' terrorist attacks"".
They added: ""He will be meeting survivors of the attacks and senior Israeli leaders to outline UK support for Israel's right to defend itself.""
The deaths of Nathanel Young, Bernard Cowan and Jake Marlowe have been confirmed.
Mr Young was a 20-year-old who attended JFS School, a Jewish school in North London, and was serving in the military in Israel.
The school's headteacher, David Moody, said the school's community was ""devastated"" and ""heartbroken"" at the news of his death.
He added: ""Nathanel is fondly remembered within the school and we think of him with nothing but love.""
Mr Young's funeral, held at Israel's national cemetery Mount Herzl, was interrupted after loud bangs were heard over Jerusalem.
More than 1,000 people turned out and listened as Mr Young's younger brother Elliot paid tribute to him.
But when his sister started to remember him, an emergency siren pierced the tranquillity and prompted mourners to throw themselves to the ground, taking cover under trees and between gravestones.
Bernard Cowan grew up in Glasgow before settling in Israel with his wife and three children.
His family said in a statement: ""We are grieving the loss of our son and brother, Bernard Cowan, who was horrifically murdered on Saturday during the surprise terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas.
""We ask for privacy at this time while we process this huge loss to our family, both at home and in Israel, and to the Jewish community in Glasgow where he will be sorely missed.""
Jake Marlowe was working as a security guard at the Supernova music festival, where 260 people were killed when it was stormed by militants. On Wednesday afternoon, the Israeli Embassy in London confirmed he was also among the victims.
The 26-year-old has been reported as missing after the attack, which took place at the Re'im kibbutz around 3.7 miles (6km) from the Gaza barrier.
Mr Marlowe was also a former pupil of JFS in North London.
The family of Daniel Darlington have also said they believe he is among those killed.
In a statement posted on Instagram, his sister referred to him as Danny and her ""baby brother"". She said he was killed at the Nir Oz kibbutz alongside a friend.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the UK is offering ""moral"" as well as ""practical support"" to Israel.
He said he had spoken to ministers in the Israeli government.
""We have asked the Israeli government to let us know what they need. And again, we continue to talk to them about that.""
Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has written to Mr Cleverly to ask what steps are being taken to ensure that British people who want to leave Israel are able to do so.
Mr Lammy, whose Tottenham constituency is home to a significant Jewish population, told the foreign secretary that while Israeli airspace ""has not officially been closed"", most UK airlines have been ""forced to cancel their flights for the foreseeable future"".
""This is obviously deeply concerning for all those who are desperate to return to loved ones in the UK,"" he said.

People hide in homes as Palestinian militants enter from Gaza,,BBC,,"For hours, people in Israel have been phoning into news stations saying they're trapped in their homes, after Palestinian militants entered their towns and villages in a huge surprise attack.
Many are in hiding, saying they can hear gunfire, while others can not find loved ones.
""The terrorists are trying to break into my house,"" Ayelet Hachim told Channel 12, from her home in the town of Kibbutz Be'eri, close to the Gaza strip.
""I hear their voices and they are banging on the door. I am with my two little children.""
Israel has told civilians near the border to stay in shelters. But in Kibbutz Be'eri, residents said Palestinian militants were trying to get into homes and shelters.
One resident living in the town told Channel 12 that ""there's shooting from across the town, I'm at home and I hear them outside my house. We're sitting quietly, the entire town is quiet so they won't come for us"".
And 23-year-old resident Ella said she has heard that ""the terrorists are in the shelter"", adding: ""I still hear bursts of gunfire.""
All homes in Israel are required by law to have bomb shelters, and there are also bomb shelters in public places too.
It is one of the most serious escalations in the Israel-Palestinian conflict in years - with fighters from militant group Hamas crossing into Israel from Gaza at dawn, using motorbikes, paragliders and boats in an unprecedented assault.
They claim to have taken dozens of Israelis captive, while in the the town of Sderot, gunmen purportedly opened fire on residents.
At least 250 people are reported killed in Israel and many more wounded.
""I've been in the shelter with my week-old baby for over two hours, while my house is on fire,"" said one resident of Kibbutz Nirim, near to the Gaza strip, on Channel 13.
Other residents have been putting out pleas on social media.
""Urgent, urgent, please help this get to the media,"" Ella Mor wrote on Facebook. ""We need to save my nephews who are in hiding. They called to say that they shot their mum and dad and they're dead in Kfar Aza. They can't find the baby girl.
""The police don't answer; Magen David Adom [Israel's emergency medical service] can't get to the Kibbutz.""
Elsewhere, a woman called Adele said on Facebook: ""We have been told to lock doors, not leave the safe room. We're not even turning in the air-conditioning for fear it will signal a presence of people in the house.
""My stomach is turning. I hear a lot of shooting, even though the thick walls of the safe room. I need to go to the bathroom, but I dare not. I have literally never been this frightened.""
In Kibbutz Nir Oz, in southern Israel close to the border with Gaza, a resident called Yoni wrote on Facebook: ""They kidnapped my mother-in-law and left [with her] -  I urgently need to get in contact with the army and media.""
Ofir, a resident of Sufa, said: ""We are locked in our shelter, the army isn't here. My husband is with the preparedness squad fighting outside. They're firing on us in our homes, trying to come into our houses.
""The Kibbutz WhatsApp group is going crazy with messages that people are writing that they're shooting on their houses. We are close to the fence, I don't know where the army is, there's no-one here.""
The unprecedented attack by Hamas began early on Saturday morning, as the fighters used cover from a barrage of rockets.
The militants claimed to have fired thousands of rockets - with some targeting cities as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
Israeli author and journalist Gideon Levy, who is in Tel Aviv, told the BBC: ""The streets are totally empty. Restaurants, cafes everything is locked down and there is a heavy feeling of surprise, of shock and of fear from what is still expected to happen.
""When the first rockets fell, I was still jogging in the park, the noise was terrible.""
Israel has launched waves of air strikes in the Gaza Strip in response.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ""at war"" and vowed that Hamas, Gaza's rulers, will ""pay a price it has never known"".
The strikes on Gaza have killed more than 230 people and left many others wounded, according to local Palestinian officials.

"Gaza journalist killed alongside 42 relatives, news agency says",,BBC,By Ali Abbas Ahmadi,"A Palestinian reporter has been killed alongside 42 family members, his news agency says, as a watchdog said the past month had been the most deadly for journalists since its records began.
The Wafa news agency said Mohammad Abu Hasira was killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza City.
At least 37 journalists had been killed since the war began, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said.
These include 32 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese.
The CPJ said it was unclear whether all had been covering the conflict at the time of their deaths but said it was including them in its count while it investigated the circumstances.
The group began documenting journalist fatalities in 1992.
Last month Israel told international news organisations Reuters and AFP that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was targeting Hamas throughout Gaza and accused the group of placing military operations ""in the vicinity of journalists and civilians"".
Israeli air strikes could additionally damage nearby buildings, the IDF said.
On Saturday AFP called on Israel to investigate an air strike that severely damaged its office located on the top floors of an 11-storey building.
""A strike on the offices of an international news agency sends a deeply troubling message to all the journalists working in such difficult conditions in Gaza,"" said AFP boss Fabrice Fries.
Last week, Mohammad Abu Hatab, a correspondent for the Palestine TV news channel was killed in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip in an Israeli airstrike, along with 11 members of his family.
His colleague Salman Al-Bashir broke down in tears on air when learning of his death, removing his vest and helmet saying that the even the protective gear was not keeping journalists alive.
Two Israeli photographers, Roee Idan and Yaniv Zohar, and members of their families were killed when Hamas attacked kibbutzes Kfar Aza and Nahal Oz on 7 October.
Two Israeli reporters, Shai Regev and Ayelet Arnin, were killed during the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival onthe same day, Israeli media reported.
In Lebanon, prominent Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah was killed when covering Israeli rockets fired over the Israel-Lebanon border on 13 October. He was part of a group of journalists near the border town of Alma al-Shaab in southern Lebanon when he was hit by a rocket. Six other journalists were also injured in the strike.
Shortly before Abdallah was killed, he posted on Instagram a picture of himself wearing a helmet and a flak jacket with the word ""press"" written on it.
Six other journalists, including from Reuters, Al Jazeera and Agency France-Presse, were wounded. One of them, Reuters video journalist Maher Nazeh, said the teams ""were filming missile fire coming from the direction of Israel when one struck Abdallah as he was sitting on a low stone wall near the rest of the group"", according to a report published by the news agency.
IDF spokesman Richard Hecht said the army was ""deeply regretful for the incident"" and was ""actively investigating it"" without saying that Israeli military was behind it.
More than 10,300 people have been killed during Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Israel's retaliatory strikes began in response to Hamas' brutal 7 October attack, when the group killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages.

Israel's borders explained in maps,,BBC,,"More than 75 years after Israel declared statehood, its borders are yet to be entirely settled. Wars, treaties and occupation mean the shape of the Jewish state has changed over time, and in parts is still undefined. Here is a series of maps explaining why.
The land which would become Israel was for centuries part of the Turkish-ruled Ottoman Empire. After World War One and the collapse of the empire, territory known as Palestine - the portion of which west of the River Jordan was also known as the land of Israel by Jews - was marked out and assigned to Britain to administer by the victorious allied powers (soon after endorsed by the League of Nations).
The terms of the mandate entrusted Britain with establishing in Palestine ""a national home for the Jewish people"", so long as doing so did not prejudice the civil and religious rights of non-Jewish communities there.
The rise of Palestinian Arab nationalism coupled with the rapid growth of Palestine's smaller Jewish population - especially after the advent of Nazism in the 1930s - saw an escalation in Arab-Jewish violence in Palestine.
Britain handed the problem to the United Nations, which in 1947 proposed partitioning Palestine into two states - one Jewish, one Arab - with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area to become an international city. The plan was accepted by Palestine's Jewish leadership but rejected by Arab leaders.
The Jewish leadership in Palestine declared the establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the moment the British mandate terminated, though without announcing its borders.
The following day Israel was invaded by five Arab armies, marking the start of Israel's War of Independence. The fighting ended in 1949 with a series of ceasefires, producing armistice lines along Israel's frontiers with neighbouring states, and creating the boundaries of what became known as the Gaza Strip (occupied by Egypt) and East Jerusalem and the West Bank (occupied by Jordan).
The surrounding Arab states refused to recognise Israel, meaning its borders remained unset.
The biggest change to Israel's frontiers came in 1967, when the conflict known as the Six Day War left Israel in occupation of the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and most of the Syrian Golan Heights - effectively tripling the size of territory under Israel's control. Israel effectively annexed East Jerusalem - claiming the whole of the city as its capital - and the Golan Heights.
These moves were not recognised by the international community, until the US changed its official position on the matter under the Trump administration, becoming the first major power to do so. Overwhelmingly, international opinion continues to consider East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as occupied territory.
One of Israel's land borders was formalised for the first time in 1979, when Egypt became the first Arab country to recognise the Jewish state. Under the treaty, Israel's border with Egypt was set and Israel withdrew all its forces and settlers from the Sinai, a process which was completed in 1982.
That left Israel in occupation of the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, with its frontiers (excluding that of Egypt) still delineated by the 1949 armistice lines.
In 1994, Jordan became the second Arab state to recognise Israel, formalising its long border with the Jewish state in the process. While there has not yet been a peace treaty between Israel and Lebanon, the two countries' 1949 armistice line serves as Israel's de facto northern border, while Israel's border with Syria remains unsettled.
Similarly, Israel has had a de facto border with Gaza since it pulled its troops and settlers out in 2005, but Gaza and the West Bank are considered a single occupied entity by the UN, and the official borders have not yet been determined.
The final status and contours of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem are meant to be decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians living there under Israeli occupation, but decades of on-off talks have so far proved fruitless.
The border around the Gaza Strip has grown into a semi-permanent structure with security fences and concrete walls set deep into the ground to prevent tunnelling - after Hamas militants launched a series of raids from tunnels into Israel in 2014. However, Hamas militants again breached the security barriers above ground in the biggest attack of its kind on 7 October, 2023.

Could an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?,2023-11-07,BBC,By Paul Kirby,"Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.
""We have set two goals for the war: to eliminate Hamas by destroying its military and governing capabilities and to do everything possible to bring our hostages at home,"" announced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Israel expanded its ground operations in Gaza.
Operation Swords of Iron began in response to the killing of more than 1,400 people by Hamas gunmen in a brutal attack on Israeli communities, and Israel's chief of staff has said the military are fighting ""for our right and the right of future generations to live in safety"".
That goal of ending Hamas rule has been endorsed by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in October that the final phase of Israel's Gaza plan was for a ""new security regime"" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.  Mr Netanyahu has since said ""Israel will, for an indefinite period have the overall security responsibility"", to prevent further Hamas attacks.
Israel's aims appear far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before. But are they realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?
Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say 10,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 240 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.
""I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,"" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. ""But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.""
Weakening it so it no longer poses a military threat to Israelis might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed.
Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.
Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says.
In Antony Blinken's words, Hamas's ""perverted idea"" has to be combated with a ""better idea"" and a vision that gives people something to hope for.
The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.
Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, has the use ofan extensive network of tunnelsand it has targeted Israeli forces with snipers and fighters armed with anti-tank missiles.
The civilian death toll has soared since ground operations expanded on 27 October, and the IDF has lost increasing numbers of soldiers in combat.
Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty.
The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe.
""The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders,"" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.
But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in.
""It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,"" says Michael Milstein.
Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.
Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders, and Hamas's political leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, has said they are ready to swap all the hostages for the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
That kind of deal is unlikely.
In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. Yahya Sinwar was among those freed, and is now their top man in Gaza.
What could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.
Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point for supplies getting into Gaza. Hundreds of foreign passport holders and some of the wounded have been allowed to leave but more remain.
""The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,"" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.
But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has said Egypt rejects any attempt to move Gazans forcibly into the Sinai peninsula, adding that it would prompt Egyptians to ""go out and protest in their millions"".
An internal Israeli intelligence ministry policy paper has raised the prospect of the Gaza population being expelled from the territory, but only a handful of far-right politicians have shown interest in the idea.
Jordan's King Abdullah has talked of a ""red line"" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: ""No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,"" he warned.
Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been regular, deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, and communities on both sides have been evacuated.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has said ""all options are open"", but for the moment there is no indication of a broader axis against Israel opening up from the north.
Hezbollah's main sponsor, Iran, has threatened ""new fronts"" against Israel, and Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have fired missiles and drones towards Israel too.
But US President Joe Biden has issued a stern warning to Iran and its allies: ""To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!""
Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and some 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.
If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place.
Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and government officials have said repeatedly they have ""no desire to occupy or reoccupy Gaza"". US President Joe Biden has said any move to occupy it again ""would be a big mistake"".
A month into the war, Benjamin Netanyahu said once the war was over, it would be governed by ""those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas"", and that Israel would ""for an indefinite period"" have overall security responsibility. While not the same as re-occupation, it implies Israel would demand a substantial role.
Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007.
The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated.
Antony Blinken has said it would make ""most sense... for an effective and revitalised"" PA to run Gaza, although a number of other countries in the region could take part in ""temporary arrangements"" that might involve international agencies.
What is clear is that a power vacuum would lead to even more problems.
The United Nations could theoretically fill the gap in running Gaza temporarily, as it did in Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999. But that kind of solution would not go down well in Israel, where the UN is widely mistrusted.
Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Michael Milstein.
Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a ""demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now"".
Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.
Israel will want even tighter restrictions on ""dual-use goods"" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities.

Rishi Sunak says Al-Ahli hospital blast likely caused by missile from Gaza,,BBC,,"Rishi Sunak says the UK has judged that the blast at Gaza's Al-Ahli hospital was likely caused by ""a missile, or part of one"" fired from ""within Gaza"".
The PM said the conclusion was based on the ""deep knowledge and analysis of our intelligence and weapons experts"".
Media outlets, including the BBC, reported an initial Hamas statement blaming Israel for Tuesday's explosion.
Israel denied this shortly afterwards, saying that it was caused by a misfiring rocket from within Gaza.
Mr Sunak told the House of Commons: ""On the basis of the deep knowledge and analysis of our intelligence and weapons experts, the British government judges that the explosion was likely caused by a missile, or part of one, that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel.""
Mr Sunak said that ""misreporting"" of the blast had had a ""negative effect in the region"".
""We need to learn the lessons and ensure that in future there is no rush to judgement,"" he said.
Regional leaders cancelled a meeting with US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the explosion.
Mr Biden has since backed the Israeli assessment of the incident.
Mr Sunak also said the UK would give a further £20 million of humanitarian aid to Gaza, doubling its earlier funding.
He said Palestinians were suffering, and called them ""victims of Hamas"".
He added that ""we need to invest more deeply in regional stability and in the two-state solution"" to the conflict, which would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.
The prime minister said there  was""no scenario"" where Hamas could be allowed to ""control Gaza or any part of the Palestinian territories"".
He also made mention of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""It is a same motivation that drives [Vladimir] Putin's war on Ukraine, the fear of Ukraine's emergence as a modern, thriving democracy and a desire to pull it back into some imperialist fantasy of the past. Putin will fail and so will Hamas,"" he said.
He alsocondemned the use of the word ""jihad""at a pro-Palestinian protest in London over the weekend. A video posted online appeared to show a man shouting the word at a separate event from the main pro-Palestine march.
""Calls for jihad on our streets are not only a threat to the Jewish community but to our democratic values and we expect the police to take all necessary action to tackle extremism head-on,"" he said.
Opposition leader Keir Starmer said humanitarian corridors must be established for civilians in Gaza trying to escape violence.
He said basic human needs like water, food and medicine must not be denied to people who need them.
""Gaza needs aid and it needs to be rapid, safe, unhindered and regular,"" he said.
The first aid convoys reached Gaza through the border with Egypt over the weekend - 20 lorries on Saturday and 14 on Sunday.
The UN said much more was needed and the Rafah border crossing is still not open for foreign nationals seeking to flee Gaza.
Israel says that more than 1,400 people were killed when Hamas attacked communities near Gaza on 7 October, shooting civilians dead in their homes, in the streets and at a music festival.
Gaza's health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, says more than 5,000 people have been killed in the enclave.
At least 10 British nationalswere among those killed in the Hamas attacks.
Yosef Guedalia, 22, is the latest British-Israelinamed as being killed by Hamas. The soldier was part of an anti-terror unit when he was killed confronting Hamas gunmen at Kibbutz Kfar Aza.

"Gaza hospitals risk turning into morgues, Red Cross says",,BBC,By Rushdi Abu Alouf & George Wright,"Hospitals in Gaza risk turning into morgues without electricity, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says.
Gaza's only power plant ran out of fuel on Wednesday, and back-up generators could stop working in hours, it adds.
Medical centres have been overwhelmed after Israel imposed a ""complete siege"" on Gaza and pounded the territory with air and artillery strikes.
Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on Saturday.
Israel has vowed not to restore electricity or allow basic resources and humanitarian aid into Gaza until Hamas releases around 150 hostages it abducted during its attacks on Saturday.
""As Gaza loses power, hospitals lose power, putting newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Kidney dialysis stops, and X-rays can't be taken,"" said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's director for the region.
""Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues.""
He added that hospitals were still running on generators - but fuel would only last ""for a few hours"".
Hospitals in Gaza are seeing long queues outside, with injured people waiting for emergency rooms. They are running out of essential medical equipment and appealing for blood donations.
Children - some seriously wounded - are lying in hospital beds crying, waiting for treatment.
The largest public healthcare complex in the Gaza Strip, the Al-Shifa Hospital, is ""overloaded"", a doctor there told the BBC.
""We can hardly manage dealing with the patients"", said Dr Mohamad Matar.
Doctors are now having to make tough decisions on who to operate on, as fuel supplies run critically low. Doctors say only life-saving treatment is being carried out in many cases.
The absence of humanitarian corridors is resulting in unprecedented problems for hospitals. In previous wars, the ICRC and UN were able to secure corridors to deliver aid but Israel has not yet allowed for this.
The main option being considered, the ICRC says, is the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said on Thursday that his government was working with Egypt to open corridors for humanitarian aid.
""Closing all access to the Gaza Strip and preventing aid is a mass killing of our people,"" he said.
Egypt says it has been trying to arrange aid deliveries through the Rafah crossing, but this has been made difficult by Israeli bombardment in the territory.
Those air strikes have meant people are also filling up hospitals to shelter, believing they are safer there than other parts of Gaza.
Dr Justin Dalby, who has been working in Gaza for six months with the humanitarian charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) told the BBC that the number of injured was ""just absolutely immense"".
He said there was ""constant violence"" as ""destruction continues everywhere ... day or night"".
""If you are taking out the electricity supply of a hospital, it means that lights go off. Monitoring equipment, oxygen delivery, mechanical ventilators, operating theatres and surgical equipment that require electricity will no longer be able to function,"" he said.
Hamas took about 150 Israeli hostages into Gaza during its deadly attacks on southern Israel at the weekend that killed at least 1,300 people.
Israel's Energy Minister Israel Katz said ""no electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter"" until the ""abductees"" are free.
Israel stopped supplies to the Gaza Strip after the Hamas attacks on Saturday.
More than 1,300 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its air strikes on Saturday, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. A further 5,339 have been injured.
Meanwhile, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees says more than 338,000 people have been displaced, with most sheltering in hospitals and UN schools.
""The human misery caused by this escalation is abhorrent, and I implore the sides to reduce the suffering of civilians,"" Mr Carboni of the ICRC said.

"WHO says Gaza's al-Shifa hospital a death zone, as hundreds leave",,BBC,By Oliver Slow,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has described al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City as a ""death zone"".
A joint UN team led by the WHO assessed the hospital for one hour following its occupation by the Israeli military and as some patients and those seeking shelter there began to evacuate it.
The team said they saw evidence of shelling and gunfire and observed a mass grave at the hospital's entrance.
They were told it held the remains of 80 people.
Following an evacuation which the hospital director said was ordered by the Israeli army but which the army said was requested by the director, 300 critically ill patients remain in al-Shifa - formerly the largest and most advanced hospital in Gaza.
The WHO said it was trying to arrange the urgent evacuation of remaining patients and staff to other facilities in Gaza, and repeated calls for a ceasefire.
Meanwhile, the White House has responded to areport in the Washington Postwhich said Israel, Hamas and the US were on the verge of a deal that would see the release of women and children seized by Hamas on 7 October in exchange for a five-day pause in fighting.
A White House spokesperson said no such deal had yet been reached but it was working hard to get one agreed.
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has ruled out a full ceasefire with Hamas and said he will consider only a temporary truce in exchange for the return of hostages kidnapped by the group.
Hundreds of people, including some patients, left al-Shifa on Saturday.
A journalist at al-Shifa hospital told the BBC that only ""patients who could not move and a very small number of doctors"" remained behind.
""We raised our hands and carried white flags,"" Khader, a journalist who had been at al-Shifa, told the BBC.
The IDF denied ordering the evacuation of al-Shifa and said it had agreed to a request from the hospital's director for those wanting to leave to evacuate through a ""secure route"".
""At no point did the IDF order the evacuation of patients or medical teams and in fact proposed that any request for medical evacuation will be facilitated by the IDF,"" a statement said.
Dr Ramez Radwan, a doctor who said he was ordered to leave al-Shifa by Israeli authorities, described the situation at the hospital as ""miserable"", saying there were no painkillers or antibiotics and some patients had ""worms coming out of the wounds"".
Israel's military has raided the hospital in recent days, as part of what it describes as a ""targeted operation against Hamas"", but is yet to provide substantial evidence that the group conducted a major operation in tunnels underneath the medical complex.
Separately, Hamas health officials said two explosions in Jabalia in northern Gaza together killed 80 people.
Israel told the BBC it could not confirm it struck a UN school-turned-shelter but was investigating.
BBC Verify has geolocated footage to al-Fakhoura school in Jabalia that shows many people - including women and children - with severe injuries or lying motionless on the floor in different parts of the building.
There are more than 20 such casualties visible in the footage, and around half of these are seen in one particular room on the ground floor, which also shows signs of considerable damage.
The head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said he had seen ""horrifying images and footage of scores of people killed and injured"" in one of his agency's schools ""sheltering thousands of displaced"".
""These attacks cannot become commonplace, they must stop,"" he said.
Elsewhere, the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 30 people from the same family had been killed elsewhere in Jabalia, in what it also said was an Israeli strike.
The IDF had no immediate comment on the report but said it was expanding operations in Gaza, including in Jabalia, to target Hamas.
It has told Palestinians in northern Gaza to leave for their own safety and has now begun telling people in the southern city of Khan Younis, where many thousands of people who have fled northern Gaza are, thatthey must now also leave.
Israel says the aim is to wipe out Hamas, following its attack on Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage.
The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.

Inside the West Bank district under harsh Israeli lockdown since Hamas attack,2023-11-19,BBC,By Joel Gunter,"Fawaz Qafisha cracked his front door open a few inches, stuck his head through the gap and squinted against the sun. The street outside was almost completely dead, save for an Israeli soldier who was sitting on a garden chair placed opposite Qafisha's house, facing the front door.
Before Qafisha had even adjusted his eyes to the light and spotted us coming down the road towards him, the Israeli soldier had sprung to his feet, raised his rifle halfway and ordered Qafisha back inside.
The falafel cook, aged 52, gestured for us to hurry.
""This is how it is any time we try to open the door now,"" he said, as we entered.
""We are not even allowed to stand at our windows.""
Qafisha, who was born and raised in Hebron, in the occupied West Bank, is a resident of H2, a dense and heavily fortified district that is home to 39,000 Palestinians and roughly 900 Israeli settlers considered some of the most extreme in the occupied territory. The Palestinians and Israelis of H2 are separated in some places here by just a few feet, and surrounded by cameras, cages, checkpoints, concrete blast walls and rolls of razor wire.
For more than 40 days now, since the Hamas attack on Israel, 11 Palestinian neighbourhoods within H2 - comprising about 750 families - have been under one of the harshest lockdowns imposed on the area for more than 20 years. H2's population is almost entirely Palestinian, but the district is under the total control of the Israeli military, which has for the past few weeks been forcing Palestinian residents back inside their homes at gunpoint.
Qafisha and his family of nine had barely left the house, he said. He did not want to take any risks. ""You saw what happened when you arrived,"" he said. ""We have a door we cannot open and windows we cannot look out from. We do not have any freedom. We are living in fear.""
Qafisha's house sat just off Shuhada Street, once one of the busiest Palestinian market streets in Hebron. In 1994, a massacre of 29 Muslims by a Jewish extremist at a nearby mosque led to riots, which in turn prompted a crackdown by the Israeli army. The army forcibly closed Palestinian businesses and then welded shut the front doors of the Palestinian residents, on the Shuhada Street side.
Since then, the Palestinians of the area around Shuhada Street have lived through shifting restrictions on where they can go, when, and how. Flare-ups in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have often led to some form of lockdown, but several residents told the BBC that this was the harshest they had ever experienced.
A few hundred feet up the road from Qafisha's house, Zleekhah Mohtaseb, a 61-year-old former tour guide and translator, was staring down from her rooftop, watching a young Israeli settler shouting to himself as he meandered slowly down Shuhada Street.
Mohtaseb had had spent all her six decades within a stone's throw of where she stood now, she said. Directly across Shuhada street, no more than 20 feet away, was Hebron Cemetery, where 10 generations of her family were buried. Once upon a time, she could walk straight across the street and into the cemetery. Now it took her an hour by car.
""The settlers,"" she said, shaking her head, as the young Israeli walked past her welded-shut front door. ""They can do what they want. They are the chosen people.""
Mohtaseb had seen a lot in her lifetime in Hebron, but the past 40 days had been among the most tense, she said. Hours after Hamas attacked Israel, in a murderous rampage that left an estimated 1,200 Israelis dead, Palestinian residents of H2 received messages from the Israeli military telling them that they were no longer allowed to leave their homes. Israeli soldiers began forcing people off the streets at gunpoint, including Mohtaseb. ""Those first two weeks were hell,"" she said.
Two weeks after it began, the curfew in H2 relented slightly, allowing the Palestinians to leave their homes for certain hours on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Then this past Thursday, as Mohtaseb was preparing to meet us, three Palestinian militants from Hebron attacked an Israeli checkpoint dividing the West Bank from Jerusalem, killing one soldier and wounding five. Immediately, she knew that the attack would prolong and intensify the crackdown in H2.
""Everyone says that Israel has the right to defend herself. Fine. We are not against it. But what about us, the Palestinians?"" she said.
""Many times we were attacked, many times we were killed, many times we were forced from our homes. Where was this right to defend when the Palestinians were attacked?""
H2 began life in 1997 when Hebron was divided into two sectors, under an agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel. H1, populated entirely by Palestinians and controlled by the Palestinian Authority, accounts for roughly 80% of the city. H2, which accounts for just 20% of the city, is populated almost entirely by Palestinians but controlled by the Israeli military. Within H2, the area around Shuhada Street and the Ibrahimi Mosque is the most fortified by checkpoints and guard posts. It has seen decades of tension, violence, and terror attacks from both sides.
""This is the closed place inside the closed place,"" said Muhammad Mohtaseb, a 30-year-old hospital security guard, sitting on the roof of his house opposite the mosque.
""We are completely surrounded by checkpoints,"" he said. ""Even on a good day, I cannot drive a car, no car can come in with Palestinian number plates. If I want to bring something to my house, I have to carry it half a kilometre from the checkpoint. When I got married, I bought all new furniture for my bedroom, but I had to take it all apart into pieces on the other side of the checkpoint to get it through the turnstiles, then rebuild it on this side.""
That was a good day. Since 7 October, the freedom even to move around in the street was gone. When we arrived at Mohtaseb's home, just like at the home of Fawaz Qafisha, a soldier sprang towards the door and ordered Mohtaseb back inside.
Up on the roof, Mohtaseb rolled a cigarette and looked out over the empty streets. With three of his four children out of school - the H2 schools have all been closed - Mohtaseb had been at home and away from work for 40 days. Fortunately for him, his employer had been understanding and was still paying him.
This was not the case for everyone. Qafisha, the falafel cook, had been unable to fulfil his work responsibilities since the lockdown began, because he could only go out three days a week, and on those three days the allotted hours did not match the hours he would need to travel for work anyway. And unlike Mohtaseb's employer, his had not been understanding. ""In these jobs, if you work you eat,"" he said. ""And if you don't work you don't eat.""
Qafisha had borrowed money several times from friends, to buy food for the family, but he was running out of options. ""Anything that you spend you cannot replace,"" he said, sitting in his living room, away from the window. ""So we are sinking.""
The following morning, there was another armed attack on Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian militant, this one in Hebron itself. This time it resulted in only the attacker's death. But a few hours later, another message was sent out via WhatsApp from the Israeli military to the Palestinian residents of Shuhada Street.
""A notification for the residents of Shuhada Street,"" it said. ""You are forbidden to be in the streets for one week."" And if they left H2, it said, they would not be allowed to re-enter until the week had passed.
The lockdown in H2 was a ""blatant example of how Israel is implementing collective punishment in the West Bank"", said Dror Sadot, a spokeswoman for the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem.
""The Palestinians in Hebron are paying a price for something they didn't do,"" she said. ""People cannot go to work, children cannot go to school, they are having trouble getting water and food. It is collective punishment, and it is illegal under international law.""
The Israeli military told the BBC in a statement that its forces operate in the West Bank ""in accordance with the situational assessment in order to provide security to all residents of the area.""
""Accordingly, there are dynamic checkpoints and efforts to monitor movement in different areas in Hebron,"" it said.
Among the Israeli settlers living in H2, in the hardline Kiryat Arba settlement, is Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir. On Thursday, Ben Gvir, who has personally overseen the distribution of thousands of new rifles to West Bank settlers since October 7th, said that Israel should take the same approach to the occupied territory that it was taking in Gaza, where more than 11,000 Palestinians have now been killed. ""Containment will blow up in our faces,"" Ben Gvir said, of the West Bank. ""Just like it did in Gaza.""
According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since 7 October, by settlers or in clashes with the military.
On Wednesday, just a few hundred metres from Ben Gvir's house, Areej Jabari had gathered a small group of women into a knitting circle in her home in H2, in defiance of the Israeli orders not to move in the streets that day. This was only the second successful gathering since the lockdown began, and there were only eight women present, down from around 50 who usually gather once a week at the mosque. The knitters had got there by sleight. ""We sneak through the side roads and between the buildings,"" said Huda Jabari, Areej's younger cousin, with a grin.
The women have learned, this long into the lockdown, to observe the Israeli soldiers and move when they are not looking. They use one another's houses to avoid checkpoints within H2, entering the front door in one sector and emerging from the back door into another. ""In normal times, 50 families pass through my house to get around,"" said Areej's mother Sameera, whose own house sat in the shadow of Ben Gvir's.
Areej took us up to her roof to show us her view, over an Israeli military base and guard post close to her house. Below us, Israeli settlers passed by along her street, which she was no longer allowed to use.
Since 7 October, Areej had been coming up here to the roof with her video camera to gather footage of the soldiers and send it to B'Tselem, the human rights organisation. In return, the Israeli military arrived at her house last Saturday and forced their way in, she said. ""They broke my press card and warned me not to take any more video or post anything on social media.""
They also forbade her to go up onto her roof, she said, or look out of her windows on Fridays or Saturdays, when the Israeli settlers use her road to walk from the settlement to the Jewish holy site near Shuhada Street.
The IDF told the BBC that it was aware of the incident Areej described and was following up with the specific soldiers involved to examine what happened. ""We are taking this incident very seriously,"" a spokesperson said.
To Areej, it did not feel particularly out of the ordinary. ""Any time something happens they put more restrictions on us,"" she said. ""The goal is to divide us, to split the area into small pieces and to pressure us to leave.""
She was standing up against the railing around the roof of her home, looking out over H2. ""I call this area the fortress of steadfastness,"" she said. She opened her video camera and pointed it in the direction of the Israeli guard post down the road.

Huwara: Violence flares in flashpoint West Bank town,2023-10-06,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"A 19-year-old Palestinian man has been killed in overnight violence with Israeli settlers in a flashpoint town in the occupied West Bank.
Dozens of settlers, including a far-right MP, had entered Huwara following a shooting attack on an Israeli family, in which nobody was hurt.
Israeli forces said they later killed the suspected Palestinian gunman.
Tensions have been running high in the northern West Bank approaching the end of the Jewish Sukkot holiday.
The Palestinian town of Huwara lies on the main road, Route 60, running through the north to south of the West Bank, which is used by Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
In recent months, it has seen a number of shootings on Israelis and revenge attacks by settlers who live nearby.
Early on Friday, the ultranationalist finance minister Bezalel Smotrich visited the town with settler leaders and a member of his political party, Zvi Sukkot, who was present during the previous night's events.
After Friday prayers in Huwara, a large crowd carrying Palestinian flags gathered for the funeral of Labib Dumeidi, the young Palestinian who was killed.
There were protests after the funeral, with Palestinian medics saying more than 50 people were injured in clashes with Israeli forces, including three by live gunfire.
Labib Dumeidi's relatives say that he was inside his home watching the previous night's violence when he was fatally shot in the chest. The Palestinian health ministry claims he was killed by a Jewish settler.
However, the Israeli military gave a different account, saying its soldiers shot a Palestinian who ""threw a block at an Israeli vehicle"".
Overnight, violence had spiralled after a group of Israelis, including Mr Sukkot, arrived in Huwara to set up a Sukkah - a temporary shelter that religious Jews put up for the Sukkot festival, which ends this weekend.
A video shared on social media shows that a large group of settlers, including the lawmaker, then held a Torah lesson in the middle of the road, which had been closed off by the Israeli army.
In later videos, Israelis and Palestinians can be seen throwing stones. Palestinian witnesses said that homes, shops and cars were vandalised by settlers.
The Israeli military says it used ""riot dispersal means to defuse the confrontation"". Some 60 Palestinians were given medical treatment, mostly for tear gas, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.
The local mayor, Mueen al-Dumaidi, told the BBC that some of the settlers were armed and that they had stayed in Huwara for at least five hours.  He said that Palestinians ""were defending their town"".
Mr Dumaidi added that Huwara - which has been closed to Palestinians for hours at a time in the past week for what Israel says is security reasons - was enduring ""a daily collective punishment by the army and the settlers"".
On Thursday afternoon, dashcam footage showing a Palestinian man dressed in black firing at an Israeli car stuck in traffic in the town was widely shared in the Israeli media.
The driver escaped by swerving onto the opposite side of the road and speeding off. The Israeli military said its troops later tracked down and killed the suspected gunman.
Israeli media quoted the woman who had been targeted with her husband and baby as saying: ""Thank God we escaped unscathed, my daughter is still sleeping in the car.""  She said her family had been returning to Jerusalem after visiting a settlement outpost.
Earlier on Thursday, two Palestinian gunmen and five Israeli military police officers were wounded in separate incidents in Tulkarm.
Meanwhile, at Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, explosive devices were detonated as an Israeli bus convoy passed, escorted by the Israeli military.  There were no Israeli casualties but around 100 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli security forces, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.
In the past year-and-a-half, there has been a surge in violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East War.
This has seen near-nightly Israeli military raids, an increase in Palestinian attacks on Israelis and a rise in Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and their property.
Settlements are seen as illegal under international law, but Israel disagrees.  Several members of the current Israeli hardline government, including Mr Smotrich, are strong supporters of settlements.

Palestinians under attack as Israeli settler violence surges in the West Bank,,BBC,By Joel Gunter,"Abed Wadi was getting dressed for the funeral when the message arrived.
It was an image, forwarded to him by a friend, of a group of masked men posing with axes, a petrol canister, and a chainsaw, with text printed on the image in Hebrew and Arabic.
""To all the rats in the sewers of Qusra village, we are waiting for you and we will not mourn you,"" the text said.
""The day of revenge is coming.""
Qusra was Wadi's village, in the northern part of the West Bank near Nablus. The funeral that day was for four Palestinians from the village. Three had been killed the previous day - Wednesday 11 October - after Israeli settlers entered Qusra and attacked a Palestinian family home.
The fourth was shot dead in clashes with Israeli soldiers that followed.
The following day, the Qusra villagers were preparing to set out for a hospital half an hour away and return with the bodies of the dead. To do so, they would need to travel across land that is dotted with Israeli settlements, where the risk of violence, high even in ordinary times, has risen dramatically in the two weeks since the Hamas attack that launched a war with Israel.
Wadi put his phone down and continued getting dressed. There were four men in refrigerators in the hospital who needed to be brought home. He was not going to be deterred by a threat, he said. He had heard too many.
There was no way for Wadi to know that, in a few hours' time, hardline Israeli settlers would confront the funeral procession and his own brother and young nephew would be shot dead.
""If we had delayed one or even two days, what good would it have done?"" Wadi said, sitting in the shaded courtyard of his family home in Qusra.
""Do you think that the settlers would have left this place on the second day?""
According to the UN's humanitarian office, the week that followed Hamas's murderous attack was the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since it began reporting fatalities in 2005, with at least 75 Palestinians killed by the Israeli military or settlers, and incidents of settler violence up from an average of three a day to eight.
In one raid on a Palestinian refugee camp, and a rare air strike in the region, on Thursday 12th, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people, Palestinian officials said, and Israeli police said one officer was killed.
There was ""a real risk"" of the occupied territory ""spiralling out of control"", the UN said this week.
Palestinian residents of the West Bank say that while the world's attention is drawn to the unfolding disaster in Gaza, Israeli settlers are taking advantage by entering villages and expelling, and even killing, Palestinian civilians.
In at least three cases, according to video footage or eyewitness testimony from villagers, the settlers have been wearing military uniforms or accompanied by the Israeli military in their attacks.
The first three men who died in Qusra had gone to defend a family in a house on the outskirts of the village, after settlers approached the house and began throwing rocks at it, several residents told the BBC.
They say the settlers then opened fire at the Palestinian neighbours who came to assist, killing two teenagers and a young man - Hasan Abu Sorour, 16, Obayda Abu Sorour, 17, and Musab Abu Reda, 25 - and gravely wounding several others. Moath Odeh, aged 21, was killed later in clashes with soldiers.
Among the wounded were a father and his six-year-old daughter, who lived at the house, who were shot in the face and in the abdomen respectively, according to two people who received the dead and wounded at a nearby medical clinic.
One of those assisting at the clinic was Amer Odeh, a cousin of two of the victims. It fell to Amer to call Said Odeh, the father of 17-year-old Obayda.
""I told him, your son is lightly injured,"" Amer said, in an interview alongside Said in Qusra on Tuesday. ""I could not give him this shock over the phone.""
Said rushed to the medical centre. ""They told me that my son was injured but there was no way for me to see him at that moment,"" he recalled, his eyes shiny with tears.
""I told them I wanted to see my son now, and I entered that room and I saw that by the grace of God he had been martyred.""
The following day was set to be the funeral for the four victims. Abed Wadi put the image of the masked men with axes and chainsaws out of his mind and joined the funeral convoy bringing the bodies back from the hospital to Qusra.
As the cars and ambulances made their way along the Nablus-Ramallah road, the convoy was ambushed by hardline Israeli settlers. In the clash that followed, according to video footage and eyewitness testimony, settlers pelted the convoy with stones, some members of the funeral convoy threw stones back, and the Israeli settlers and soldiers responded with live fire.
In the ""chaos and heavy, random gunfire,"" Abed Wadi lost track of his brother, Ibrahim, a 63-year-old local politician with the Fatah Movement, and Ibrahim's son Ahmed, a 24-year-old law student. Video footage of part of the confrontation appears to show Ahmed and others running away from the gunfire, before Ahmed is cut down by bullets on the road.
""They told me my nephew was shot twice in his stomach and once in his neck, and my brother was shot in his waist, towards his heart,"" Wadi said.
""There were no weapons in our funeral convoy,"" he said. ""Usually we would fly the Palestinian flag from the cars but we did not even fly our flag, because of the fear.""
Residents in Qusra told the BBC this week that fear had permeated the village. Last weekend was the beginning of olive season in the area, but residents who depend on the harvest for their income said they would not go to the groves on the outskirts of the village for fear of settlers shooting.
There had already been a significant increase in violence by Israeli settlers this year, even before the Hamas attack, according to UN data, with more than 100 incidents reported each month and about 400 people driven from their land between January and August.
Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem told the BBC that since the attack, it had documented ""a concerted and organised effort by settlers to use the fact that the entire international and local attention is focused on Gaza and the north of Israel to try to seize land in the West Bank"".
Partial data compiled by B'Tselem, covering the first six days after the Hamas attack, recorded at least 46 separate incidents in which it said settlers threatened, physically attacked or damaged the property of Palestinians in the West Bank.
""A lot of shepherding families and communities have fled because they were threatened in the past week by settlers,"" said Roy Yellin, a spokesman for B'Tselem. ""Settlers have been giving residents a deadline to leave and telling them if they don't they will be harmed. And some villages have been totally emptied out.""
One of those villages was Wadi al-Siq, near Ramallah, previously home to a Palestinian Bedouin community of about 200. ""For months we have been facing harassment and attacks from settlers day and night, but since the start of the war the attacks increased,"" said Abdul Rahman Kaabna, 48, a farmer from Wadi al-Siq.
On 9 October, a group of approximately 60 settlers, many dressed in military uniforms, attacked the community, according to three now-exiled residents. ""They attacked us with weapons and terrified everyone,"" Kaabna said. ""Then they gave us one hour to go out with our sheep and threatened us to death if we didn't leave.""
The residents walked more than 10km (6.2 miles) to escape, said another resident, Ali Arara, 35. ""The settlers stole everything from our homes,"" he said. ""My daughter was terrified. They beat us and left us with nothing.""
According to B'Tselem and Yesh Din, another Israeli human rights group which monitors West Bank violence, the intimidation and forced displacement reported in Wadi al-Siq has been repeated in communities across the territory since 7 October.
In one of the most shocking incidents caught on film in the past week, an Israeli settler entered a Palestinian village called At-Tuwani near Hebron and shot an unarmed Palestinian resident in the stomach at point blank range, while an Israeli soldier appeared to look on.
The incident began when two armed settlers, accompanied by a soldier, attacked a home on the outskirts of the village, according to three residents including the homeowner.
""Three Israelis came to my house, they were armed, and one was wearing the uniform of the army,"" said Musab Rabai, 36.
""One of the settlers came into the house, pushed me and beat me on the head with the gun and told me he was going to shoot me.""
Neighbours responded to Rabai's shouts for help, he said. Among them was Zakriha Adra, a father of four. Video footage filmed by Adra's cousin, Basel, shows the settler who allegedly beat Rabai and the Israeli soldier standing a short distance away from the group of Palestinian neighbours. The armed settler then suddenly approaches Adra, strikes him with his rifle and shoots him in the stomach from just a few feet away.
Throughout the encounter, Adra appears to be holding his arms by his sides in a non-threatening manner.
According to the family, Adra is now in hospital in critical condition. ""He survived but the bullet has done a lot of damage inside his stomach,"" said Basel, his cousin.
Musab Rabai, whose house was attacked, said the shooting had been a culmination of days of threatening behaviour and property destruction by the settlers.
""Since Saturday they have been standing around the village armed with guns and using a bulldozer to destroy trees,"" he said. ""The men here in the village have been sleeping in shifts, only a few hours each, so there is always someone awake in case the settlers attack.""
The BBC asked the Yesha Council, the umbrella organisation for the settlers in the West Bank and elsewhere, to comment for this story but they declined. Moti Yogev, the acting head of the Binyamin Council, which also represents settlers in the region, said that violent settlers ""belonged to the fringes"" of the settler community. ""If they do exist, they should be dealt with like any other criminal,"" he said.
The Israeli military and Israeli police force did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
""The most tragic thing is that the violence by these extreme settlers does not produce any response from the Israeli military,"" said Dov Khenin, a former Israeli politician turned peace activist. ""And the violence has its own purpose, to get rid of these small Palestinian communities, to eject them from their homes.""
The fear for many Palestinians now is that the situation in the West Bank will only get worse. Israel's National Security Minister, Itar Ben Gvir, announced last week that the government would purchase 10,000 rifles to arm Israeli civilians, including those in West Bank settlements - a move that threatens to further blur the lines between armed settlers and members of the military in the occupied territory.
In Qusra, Abed Wadi said he had heard the news about the 10,000 rifles. He shook his head. ""It won't change anything for the people of Qusra,"" he said.
Wadi was sitting in his courtyard, surrounded by posters bearing the image of his brother, his nephew, and the four other men from the village who were killed last week.
""We have always seen the rifle in the hands of the settlers, they have been shooting at us for a long time,"" he said.
But something had changed, he said. It seemed as though the settlers had become more aggressive, more radical. ""Farm houses are being burned, olive trees cut down, cars broken into, land is being stolen,"" Wadi said.
""And this is just our village. If you were to look to the next village and the next village, you would find anger and pain in every one,"" he said. ""And you would see no end to it.""

Israel demands UN chief resign over Hamas attack comments,,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israel has demanded that the UN's secretary general retract comments he made about the Gaza war and apologise.
António Guterres said in a speech to the Security Council on Tuesday that he condemned unequivocally Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel two weeks ago but that they ""did not happen in a vacuum"".
Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan accused him of ""justifying terrorism"" and called for his immediate resignation.
On Wednesday, Mr Guterres rejected ""misrepresentations"" of his statement.
But Mr Erdan said in reply that the UN chief ""once again distorts and twists reality"", and repeated his call for Mr Guterres to resign.
On 7 October, some 1,500 Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel from Gaza. They killed at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and took another 222 people as hostages.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 6,500 people have been killed in the territory since Israel retaliated with air and artillery strikes while massing troops for an expected ground invasion.
Addressing a meeting of the UN Security Council in New York on Tuesday, Mr Guterres urged all parties in the warto respect and protect civilians.
""I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel. Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians - or the launching of rockets against civilian targets.""
He then told the council that it was ""important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum"", adding: ""The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation.""
He described how Palestinians had ""seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished"".
""But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.""
Mr Guterres also said he was deeply concerned about ""the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza"".
He expressed alarm at Israel's continuous bombardment of Gaza, as well as the level of civilian casualties and ""wholesale destruction of neighbourhoods"".
Without naming Hamas, he stressed that ""protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields"".
And without naming Israel, he said: ""Protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than one million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself.""
The UN chief also appealed for a humanitarian ceasefire to make the delivery of aid to Gaza easier and safer, and to facilitate the release of the hostages.
He called the crossing from Egypt of 62 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies since Saturday ""a drop of aid in an ocean of need"".
He warned that the failure to include fuel risked a disaster, explaining that hospitals would be left without power and drinking water would not be purified or pumped.
The foreign minister of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, Riyad al-Maliki, demanded an end to what he called the ""ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel"" against the two million people living in Gaza.
Visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen criticised Mr Guterres in his speech to the Security Council, asking him: ""In what world do you live?""
Mr Cohen said the killing of 1,400 men, women and children by Hamas constituted a massacre that would ""go down in history as more brutal"" than those committed by the Islamic State (IS) group.
""Hamas are the new Nazis,"" Mr Cohen declared. ""Just as the civilised world united to defeat the Nazis, just as the civilised world united to defeat [IS], the civilised world has to stand united behind Israel to defeat Hamas.""
Addressing the UN's appeals for proportionality and a ceasefire, he said: ""Tell me, what is a proportionate response for killing of babies, for rape [of] women and burn them, for beheading a child? How can you agree to a ceasefire with someone who swore to kill and destroy your own existence?""
Mr Cohen later wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: ""I will not meet with the UN secretary general. After the October 7th massacre, there is no place for a balanced approach.""
Mr Erdan said the secretary general had ""expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder"".
On Wednesday, the ambassador was quoted by Israeli news website Ynet as saying he had informed the UN's Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths, that his request for an Israeli visa had been refused because of Mr Guterres's remarks.
""He will not be able to come here to the region. Their agencies constantly need to bring in new people, certainly at a time like now. They will be refused.""
A spokesman for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said ""there is and can be no justification for Hamas's barbaric terrorist attack which was driven by hatred and ideology"".
Later, Mr Guterres told reporters: ""I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement... as if, as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas. This is false. It was the opposite.""
""I believe it was necessary to set the record straight, especially out of respect to the victims and to their families,"" he added.
But Mr Erdan said it was a ""disgrace to the UN that the secretary general does not retract his words and is not even able to apologise for what he said yesterday"".
""Every person understands very well that the meaning of his words is that Israel has guilt for the actions of Hamas or, at the very least, it shows his understanding for the 'background' leading up to the massacre,"" he said.
""A secretary general who does not understand that the murder of innocents can never be understood by any 'background' cannot be secretary general... I again call on him to resign.""

Pause for thought - Israel’s calculations before going into Gaza,,BBC,By Frank Gardner,"For days now, Israel has signalled that its massed forces are poised to go into Gaza with the aim of eliminating Hamas as a military force once and for all, following its raid into southern Israel on 7 October.
Over 300,000 reservists have been called up for the IDF (Israel Defence Forces). The farms, fields and kibbutzim on the Israeli side of the Gaza border are crowded with Merkava tanks, self-propelled artillery systems and thousands of heavily armed infantry in full battle dress.
The Israeli Air Force and Navy have been pounding every suspected Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad hideout and weapons store in Gaza, killing and wounding large numbers of civilians in the process, as well as a small number of Hamas commanders.
The massive number of casualties caused by Tuesday's explosion at a central Gaza hospital, blamed and denied by both sides, will only have inflamed tensions in the region even further.
So why hasn't Israel begun its promised incursion into Gaza?
There are several factors involved here.
The hurriedly-planned visit of President Joe Biden to Israel this week is an indication of how worried the White House is about the deteriorating situation. Washington has two big concerns: the escalating humanitarian crisis and the risk of this conflict spreading across the Middle East.
The US president has already made clear his opposition to any Israeli return to an occupation of Gaza, which it withdrew from in 2005. This, he said, would be ""a big mistake"".
Officially he has been visiting Israel to show strategic support for America's closest Middle East ally and to hear of Israel's plans for Gaza.
Unofficially, he is likely to be urging some restraint on the hardline government of Benjamin Netanyahu. The US would like to know how, if Israel goes into Gaza, it plans to get out, and when.
Any prospect of Israel launching a full-scale military invasion of Gaza while Airforce One is sitting parked on the tarmac in Tel Aviv would not be a good look, for either the US or Israel.
In a visit overshadowed by the deadly blast at Gaza's Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, President Biden publicly backed Israel's version of events, that a mis-fired Palestinian rocket caused the explosion. Palestinian officials say an Israeli air strike hit the hospital. The BBC is working to independently verify the death toll, which is feared to be in the hundreds, as well as the cause of the explosion.
In the last few days, Iran has issued stern warnings that Israel's assault on Gaza cannot go unanswered. So what does that mean in practice?
Iran funds, trains, arms and to some extent controls a number of Shi'a militias in the Middle East. By far the most potent of these is Hezbollah in Lebanon, sitting just across from Israel's northern border.
The two countries fought a damaging and inconclusive war in 2006 which saw Israel's modern battle tanks knocked out by hidden mines and well-planned ambushes. Since then, Hezbollah has rearmed with Iranian help and is now thought to have close to 150,000 rockets and missiles, many of which are long-range and precision-guided.
There is an implicit threat here that if Israel invades Gaza then Hezbollah may open up a new front on Israel's northern border, forcing it to fight a war on two fronts.
It is by no means certain, however, that Hezbollah wants this war at this time, especially with two US Navy carrier strike groups sailing just offshore in the eastern Mediterranean and ready to come to Israel's aid.
This will give Israel some reassurance that any attack by Hezbollah could potentially invoke a devastating retaliation from US naval air power. It is worth remembering though that at the start of Israel's last war with Hezbollah in 2006 the militants were able to hit an Israeli warship offshore with one of their sophisticated anti-ship missiles.
The Israeli government's concept of a humanitarian crisis tends to lag behind the rest of the world's when it comes to rooting out Hamas from Gaza.
As the death toll amongst Palestinian civilians mounts as a result of relentless Israeli airstrikes, much of the global sympathy for Israel after the barbaric and bloodthirsty actions of Hamas on 7 October has been replaced by a rising clamour to stop the air strikes and protect ordinary Gazans.
If and when Israeli ground forces go into Gaza in strength, then the death toll will only rise further.
Israeli soldiers will die too, from ambushes, snipers and booby traps - much of the fighting may even take place below ground, in miles of tunnels.
But it is likely that, once again, it will be the civilian population that will bear the brunt of the casualties.
Israeli intelligence has had a bad month.
Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence agency, has taken the rap for the failure to spot Hamas's initial deadly attack coming. It is supposed to have a network of informants and spies inside Gaza, keeping tabs on commanders from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Yet what happened on that horrific Saturday morning in southern Israel amounted to the worst intelligence failure in the nation's history since the Yom Kippur war in 1973.
Israeli intelligence will have been frantically trying to make amends over the last 10 days, helping the IDF identify names and locations of hostages as well as where Hamas commanders are hiding.
It is possible that they have asked for more time to gather more information so that if and when ground forces do go in, then they can head directly to a specific location, rather than wandering around the ruins and rubble of northern Gaza facing constant attack, amid rising condemnation from much of the world.
Those elements of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad that are still operational after the sustained Israeli bombing campaign will have planned ambushes and traps for any advancing Israeli troops. These will be particularly hazardous in the underground tunnels. Israeli intelligence will be keen to discover their locations and warn the IDF accordingly.

Israel says its forces killed three Palestinian militants in West Bank,,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"Israeli security forces say they have killed three Palestinian militants near Jenin camp in the occupied West Bank.
The Israeli army said the group was preparing an attack and that an automatic rifle was found in their car.
Islamic Jihad claimed one of those killed was a member, and vowed a ""strong response from the resistance"".
The deaths on Sunday came a day after a Palestinian gunman fatally shot an Israeli security guard in Tel Aviv. Another guard killed the attacker.
He is said to have come from the Jenin area.
On Friday, armed Jewish settlers attacked a Palestinian village where a young Palestinian man was shot dead.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the security forces' actions in Jenin, saying: ""We will continue to take action - everywhere and at any moment - against those who seek to attack us.""
The Jenin camp was the focus of a major Israeli operation last month.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said: ""These horrific crimes in Jenin would not have taken place had the perpetrators not felt safe from punishment.""
Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, said those killed had been ""assassinated"" and that Israel would ""not escape paying the price"".
The youngest of those killed on Sunday was 15 years old, Palestinian reports said.
On Friday night, extremist settlers went on the rampage in a Palestinian village in the West Bank, killing a 19-year-old man. Israeli police say two settlers were arrested at the time. One of those held is a former spokesman for the ultranationalist Jewish Power party, whose leader is National Security Minister in Mr Netanyahu's government.
Police said five Palestinians were also arrested overnight on Sunday in connection with the incident.
In unusual remarks on Monday, the Israel Defense Force's (IDF) spokesperson said a rise in ""nationalistic crime and terrorism"" had pushed Palestinians ""who are not involved in terrorism, toward terrorism"", Israeli news site Yediot Ahronot reported.
His comments echoed a warning to Mr Netanyahu by the head of Israel's domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet that ""Jewish terror incites Palestinian terror"", as the site put it. It said the warning was issued before Friday.
The latest settler attack meanwhile has been condemned as terrorism by Washington, its stronger language appearing to show increased frustration with the positions of Israel's far-right government.

Israeli strikes on Gaza kill top militants and 10 civilians,2023-05-09,BBC,By David Gritten,"At least 15 Palestinians, including three commanders of the militant group Islamic Jihad, have been killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip.
Palestinian health officials said eight women and children were among the dead. Another 22 people were injured.
Israel said the Islamic Jihad leaders it targeted overnight were involved in recent attacks on Israeli civilians.
Islamic Jihad has vowed revenge and Gaza-based militants are expected to respond with rocket fire into Israel.
The extent of any escalation is likely to depend on whether Hamas, which controls Gaza, decides to join in.
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the country was ""prepared for all possibilities"", adding: ""I suggest that our enemies not test us.""
The strikes were the deadliest since three days of hostilities between Israel and Islamic Jihad last August, in which 49 Palestinians were killed in Gaza.
The Israeli strikes began in the early hours of Tuesday morning, when 40 warplanes and helicopters attacked in several waves across Gaza, hitting homes and causing panic among residents.
Pictures showed at least two apartments with their fronts ripped away and others damaged.
The Gaza health ministry said four children and four women were among those killed. Half of the injured were women and children and several were in a critical condition in hospital, it added.
Russia announced that one of its citizens, Dr Jamal Khaswan, a former chairman of the Gaza Dentists' Association, was killed along with his wife Mervat and their 21-year-old son Youssef.
Another two of their children survived, it said. They included 10-year-old daughter Diala, who was filmed sitting in the front seat of an ambulance and crying out for her father.
Dr Wafai al-Sousi, a friend and colleague of Dr Khaswan, condemned what he called the ""cowardly targeting"" of the family.
""I was very surprised. He was just an incredible doctor... with a good reputation. He did not belong to any political party and never worked with any military entity,"" he told the BBC.
Palestinian sources said Dr Khaswan lived in an apartment in Gaza City close to one of the militants who was killed.
Islamic Jihad's military wing, the al-Quds Brigades, confirmed the deaths of three of its commanders, along with their wives and a number of their children. It identified them as:
""We affirm that the blood of the martyrs will increase our resolve,"" the al-Quds Brigades said. ""We will not leave our positions, and the resistance will continue, God willing.""
The IDF said Bahtini was the senior operational officer of Islamic Jihad in Gaza, and that he was responsible for recent rocket fire. It called him ""an imminent threat to the security of Israeli civilians"".
It added that Ghannam was a senior member of Islamic Jihad's rocket force and that Ezzedine was in charge of co-ordination with the group's operatives in the West Bank, planning attacks on Israeli civilians there.
The IDF said its aircraft also struck 10 sites used to manufacture weapons and six Islamic Jihad military facilities.
A spokesman said that every effort had been made to try to minimise harm to civilians, but he acknowledged that those killed included relatives of the militants, as well as Dr Khaswan and his family.
Large crowds of mourners turned out for the funerals after midday prayers.
Later on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said one of its aircraft struck a ""terrorist squad"" carrying anti-tank missiles in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.
Smoke was seen rising from a burning car after the strike. The Gaza health ministry said two people were killed and two others injured.
Officially known as Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the militant group is the biggest in Gaza next to Hamas.
It has been responsible for many of the rocket attacks on Israel from the territory in recent years and is sworn to Israel's destruction.
There was a serious flare-up last week, as Islamic Jihad and other groups fired several barrages of rockets into Israel over two days, following the death in an Israeli prison of a Palestinian hunger striker. The Israeli military carried out air strikes in response.
""On the day on which the rockets were fired last week, I ordered - together with the defence minister - the preparation of an operation to target the arch-terrorists that would, in effect, hit the senior leadership of the organisation in the Gaza Strip,"" Mr Netanyahu said at the start of a security cabinet meeting.
""Our principle is clear: whoever harms us, we will strike at them and with great force.""
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said his country ""must be ready for any scenario, including a prolonged campaign and expanding the firing ranges"" of rockets from Gaza.
Residents of Israeli communities within 40km (25 miles) of Gaza have been advised to stay close to bomb shelters.
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh warned: ""Assassination of leaders will not bring the Occupation [Israel] security but more resistance.""
In a joint statement, armed groups in Gaza said they would mourn all those who died as a result of what they called ""the treacherous Israeli aggression"" and that those responsible should ""prepare to pay the price"".
The spokesman for West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the Israeli government ""bears full responsibility for this dangerous escalation"".
UN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland condemned the deaths of civilians and urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint in order to ""avoid a broader conflict with devastating consequences for all"".
Israeli forces also carried out a raid in the West Bank city of Nablus on Tuesday.
Palestinian media reported that two Palestinians were detained and 13 others shot and injured during confrontations with the troops. Israeli media said a soldier was lightly injured when a bomb exploded beside his armoured vehicle.

Nablus: Two Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in West Bank,,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"Two Palestinian militants have been shot dead by Israeli forces during a raid in the occupied West Bank, as tensions surge in the region.
On Friday morning locals reported hearing heavy gunfire as Israeli troops surrounded a house in Nablus.
The men killed have been named locally as Khayri Shahin, 34, and Hamze Maqbool, 32.
Israel said they were wanted gunmen who fired on their forces before they could be detained.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas described the men as ""heroes of the resistance"" and accused Israel of terrorism.
It is the latest in a series of intense military raids that have taken place in the occupied West Bank over the last year.
It comes amid rapidly escalating violence this week when Israel launched a massive military assault into a refugee camp in Jenin.
At least 12 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed during the three-day incursion.
It involved Israeli armed drone strikes into the camp and gun battles with Palestinian militants.
This year has seen a growing number of armed attacks by Palestinians targeting Israelis, and Israel has said it will continue military operations to stop Jenin being a ""refuge for terrorism"".
After Friday morning's raid in Nablus, a video emerged of the two men thought to have been recorded earlier this week, in which they claimed affiliation with the Palestinian militant group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and said they would ""respond"" to the attack on Jenin.
Israel's domestic intelligence agency Shabak said they were suspected of shooting at a police car and a shop in a Jewish settlement near Nablus.
The raid triggered violent confrontations with young Palestinians.
Paramedics from the Palestinian Red Crescent said ambulances were prevented from reaching the scene, adding that one man was seriously wounded with a leg injury.
Meanwhile, the funeral took place of an Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt Shilo Yosef Amir, 22, who was shot dead by a Palestinian gunman on Thursday, close to the Jewish settlement of Kdumim near Nablus.
Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, which it described as a response to Israel's attack on Jenin.
The settlement is home to Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bazalel Smotrich.
Hamas said the attack was intended to show the minister it ""almost knocked on your door"".

Israel releases 39 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons,,BBC,By Lucy Williamson & George Wright,"A total of 39 Palestinian detainees have been released from Israeli prisons in exchange for a group of hostages held by Hamas.
The deal - mediated by Qatar - includes a four-day pause in the fighting.
They are accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to attempted murder. Some were convicted while others were awaiting trial.
The group of 24 women and 15 teenage boys was released across the Beituniya checkpoint in the occupied West Bank.
They will then be allowed to return home, according to Israel's prison service.
The detainees were chosen from a list of 300 women and minors compiled by Israel.
Less than a quarter of those on the list have been convicted - the vast majority are being held on remand while awaiting trial. Most of those listed are teenage boys - 40% of them under the age of 18. There is also one teenage girl and 32 women.
Earlier, the road by Beituniya checkpoint, near Ramallah, was sharp with the smell of tear gas. Groups of Palestinian men and boys faced the Israeli army lining up on the road ahead.
The army fired rubber bullets and tear gas towards the crowd, to push them back.
Some of the young people gathered threw stones and tear gas canisters back towards the troops.
""It's a sign of hope for Palestinians and Israelis that the ceasefire will continue and the killing will stop,"" Mohammed Khatib, who was in the crowd, told the BBC.
Upon the prisoners' release, the bus that transported them inched its way through a sea of jubilant Palestinian supporters.
Through the windows, some of the prisoners could be seen dancing, one wrapped in a Palestinian flag. Outside, mobile phones were raised to the glass amid ululations and shouts of welcome and ""God is great"".
A few in the crowd waved Hamas flags, but others spoke of Palestinian unity, a small moment of victory in the midst of a gruelling war.
For Israel, the released prisoners are a security threat; for the Palestinians gathered here to greet them, they are victims of Israel's occupation - and their release is a symbol.
Thirteen Israeli hostages were released by Hamas under the truce deal. It was confirmed on Friday that they had arrived back in Israel.
The Thai prime minister says that a group of Thai nationals held hostage by Hamas in Gaza were also released - separate from the Qatar-mediated truce deal.
Israel and Hamas reached a deal earlier this week to release 50 of the hostages held in Gaza during four-day pause in fighting.
The agreement should see a total of 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails released and a significant increase in humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Some 60 lorries carrying medical supplies, fuel and food entered from Egypt on Friday.
Hamas took more than 200 hostages during a cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed.
Human rights organisations say the number of Palestinians held without charge in Israeli jails has shot up since the 7 October attacks.
There are now thought to be more than 6,000 Palestinians held by Israel on security grounds - many still awaiting trial.
Almost every Palestinian family in the West Bank is thought to have had a relative detained by Israel at some point in the past - often in jails inside Israel, making it difficult or impossible for their relatives to visit.

Rafah crossing: More than 100 Britons leave Gaza but dozens remain,,BBC,,"More than 100 British people have left Gaza this week - and it is hoped more will be evacuated on Sunday, the deputy prime minister has told the BBC.
Oliver Dowden told Laura Kuenssberg it was ""disappointing"" the Rafah crossing was closed on Saturday.
He said the government was ""engaging closely"" with authorities there and hoped it would reopen soon.
The Rafah crossing was opened for three days earlier this week, with dozens of Britons named as eligible to leave.
The Palestinian border authority has been issuing lists of those who can present themselves at the crossing with their passports. Friday's list named more than 90 British citizens, with 88 on Saturday's list.
Before Mr Dowden's comments, it was not clear how many had actually managed to leave.
As well as some foreign passport holders and their dependents, some wounded Palestinians were also allowed to leave Gaza via the border crossing and enter Egypt.
But on Saturday, hundreds with foreign passports went to the border but were not allowed to cross.
Sources from the crossing authorities on the Palestinian side told the BBC that movement of people with foreign passports was not being allowed until there was agreement on the safety of transferring injured patients.
There has been no official statement from the authorities as yet.
It was thought there were around 200 British nationals in Gaza before war broke out.
Mr Dowden said: ""The first thing we are doing is trying to make sure we get the Rafah crossing open again and I'm hopeful we will make progress on that today.
""Secondly, we are seeking to have these temporary pauses to allow humanitarian aid in and to get our people out.""
Among Britons who have left arethe in-laws of Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf.
Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia, were allowed to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing on Friday. They had been trapped there after war broke out while they were visiting their son and grandchildren.
Mr Yousaf, writing on X, said there were mixed feelings.
""We are of course elated, but my father-in-law said 'My heart is broken in two, with my mum, son and grandchildren in Gaza'. He then broke down telling me how hard it was saying goodbye to them.""
Mr Dowden urged Britons remaining in Gaza to contact the Foreign Office.
The Foreign Office said: ""This continues to be a complex and challenging situation and we are using all diplomatic channels to press for its reopening in coordination with our international partners.
""We remain in contact with British nationals in the region to provide them with the latest information.""
Border crossings in and out of Gaza have been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage.
Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a ""complete siege"" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,400 people have been killed.
It is thought14 Britons diedin the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel. Mr Dowden said three Britons remained unaccounted for, but he was unable to say whether or not they had been taken hostage.
Abdelkader Hammad, a British transplant surgeon who lives in Liverpool, left through the Rafah crossing on Thursday after being trapped for weeks.
He told BBC Breakfast: ""It was a terrifying experience really with all the explosions around us and the shrapnel and the concrete coming down, the glass broke, and the ceiling coming down [...] but this is the picture in Gaza.
""In fact, we were the lucky ones there because we are protected by the UN. But for other people, there isn't shelter.""
Dr Hammad added: ""And I can smell, the smell of death really, because there are still a lot of bodies under the rubble.""
He later told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I can't stop thinking about my colleagues who I left there and the patients I usually treat in Gaza.
""I think many of them [kidney patients] will die to due to lack of treatment during this period.""
Many of those trapped in Gaza and seeking to leave have family in the UK urgently watching the situation.
Faras Abuwarda's wife and five children - aged between three and 11 - have been named on a list of those allowed to leave but they are stuck in the north and cannot get to Rafah.
Mr Abuwarda, who travelled with his family to see relatives but then returned to London for work, said: ""The situation is a disaster. We are disgusted at the British government as they aren't able to help us.
""What we ask for is safe travel to the border, nothing else, and we're unable to get it.""
He is waiting in Cairo, Egypt, and says his children are ""frustrated, hopeless, and feel isolated"".
Omar Mofeed, from London, said his brother and pregnant wife, along with their three children, also do not believe it is safe to travel through Gaza.
""The British foreign ministry called us saying Israel has allowed a safe route [...] then people start going, and Israel attacked people who are walking on this safe route,"" he said.
The Israeli military has said it does not target civilians.
Icel Chumlukh said his wife Lamia, his 13-year-old stepdaughter and the couple's one-year-old son had turned up at the border but were asked to leave.
While his wife and son are on the list, his step-daughter is not - but his wife took her anyway, ""hoping for a miracle"".
He said his son now ""screams every time he hears a bang, or when someone closes a door"" because they remind him of the sound of airstrikes.

Hamas attack on Israel kibbutz Be’eri captured by mothers’ WhatsApp group,,BBC,By Alice Cuddy,"""God Forbid.""
Shortly after sunrise on the morning of Saturday 7 October, a message pings on 200 phones of the Be'eri mothers' WhatsApp group.
Minutes later another message lands: ""We have a terrorist on the stairs. Call someone.""
WARNING: Some readers may find details in this article distressing.
Hamas gunmen had just begun a day-long rampage through this kibbutz in southern Israel, and over the next 20 hours the women channelled their horror, disbelief and reassurances through the chat - as militants roamed the neighbourhood shooting residents dead and setting fire to homes.
Hiding in their safe rooms these women - some huddled with their families - described the shouts and explosions they heard outside, told each other where gunmen were, shared tips on coping with smoke that filled their rooms, and repeatedly called for help. In some cases, that help never came.
As the hours ticked by, they asked questions. Where was the army? Why was help taking so long? Can somebody please look for my mother? How do I lock my safe room? Should we open the door to a man claiming to be a soldier?
At some point, somebody changed the name of the group to ""Be'eri Mothers Emergency"".
This group chat was shared with the BBC by a woman put forward by the community to speak to the media in the wake of the attacks. She is one of the mothers on the chat and shared the details with us so we could see how the terror of the day unfolded - and what a lifeline these women were in the most desperate and sometimes final hours of their lives.
We could not seek the permission of all 200 members, but three of them agreed to tell us their stories in detail, and we have anonymised all other exchanges, being careful to ensure nobody can be identified to protect their privacy.
Some members are unaccounted for, presumed dead or missing. Survivors estimate that about 100 people were killed and many were taken away as hostages.
Minute-by-minute, this chat reveals in detail not seen before how Hamas stalked, murdered and burned people in their own homes, coming back again and again. It is an insight into what it felt like across southern Israel as Hamas gunmen crashed across the border and tore through dozens of communities.
It shows how residents survived and supported one another - but it also documents, hour by hour, their growing desperation, as it became clear they would not be rescued by the Israeli state anytime soon.
Dafna Gerster, 39, was visiting from Germany and had spent Friday night with family in the kibbutz she grew up in. They had gathered at her father's house, playing the board game Camel Up into the night - and then she and her husband slept at her brother's apartment nearby knowing the next day was Saturday, the Jewish day of rest, when the families could be together again.
The community is next to the Gaza border and is used to missiles - but when Dafna awoke to the scream of rockets at 06:30, she knew immediately that something was different.
""Usually you have an alarm and a boom of the iron dome [Israel's missile defence system]. This time, there was no alarm, and it was so loud. It's a sound we could not identify.
""I went to my brother's room and asked him 'what is this?'""
Like others in the kibbutz they rushed to the safe room or mamad - a room made of reinforced concrete with airtight steel doors and windows designed to withstand rocket attacks.
But it soon became clear that rockets were not the only threat. News spread on the WhatsApp group that someone had been shot - and that there were armed men in the streets.
CCTV footage verified by the BBC shows a small group of Hamas militants arriving at the gate of the kibbutz before 06:00. A car arrives, the gate opens, and the militants run inside after shooting dead the occupants of the vehicle. Video from a few minutes later shows the same two Hamas militants walking through a square, guns by their side.
Fast forward to 07:10, as the first messages on the WhatsApp group are being shared. Video shows three motorbikes, each carrying two heavily armed Hamas militants, leaving the area by the same gate.
Other footage, which is too graphic to include here, shows militants in the kibbutz at 09:05 - three hours after first entering. It shows the same car that was shot at in the first clip with at least one body dragged out, lying in the road.
Across the kibbutz, as the community collectively barricaded themselves into their own mamads, a rising sense of dread on the chat preceded a horrible realisation: many people were struggling to lock their safe room doors.
""How do you do an emergency lock? And how do we know that it is really locked?"" one asked.
""Can you lock the safe room?"" asked another.
""To missiles yes, not to terrorists.""
Pictures shared on the WhatsApp group offered tutorials on locking the doors. Those who couldn't feared Hamas would just walk in.
At the house of Michal Pinyan, 44, her husband had run out of the safe room to lock the front of the house. The family heard shouting in Arabic outside, followed by gunshots.
After rushing back to the safe room, Michal's husband built a locking device with ropes and a baseball bat, which he gripped for the almost 19 hours they spent in the room.
In the terrified silence of these safe rooms, where people would not dare scream, they typed frantically. Michal watched the messages stream in.
They could not hear what was going on outside except via muffled sounds through the thick walls. But from what little they could make out, they collectively tried to understand what was going on.
They shared messages of ""frantic knocking"" on their doors as gunmen went house to house.
""Not knocking - it's gunfire,"" one said.
During the first hour of the attack, people would tell the group they could hear shooting in their neighbourhood, or outside a particular house. The replies inevitably poured in: ""So do we.""
""We understood it wasn't just one terrorist, it was a massive attack,"" Michal says. ""In each neighbourhood of the kibbutz we heard 'they're here, they're here' so they were in each neighbourhood at the same time.""
As the scale of the assault became clear, frustrated, fearful posts flooded the chat asking when the army was arriving - and why it wasn't there already.
""You can hear shooting close by. Hoping it's the first response squad firing,"" one woman wrote, referring to a small unit in the kibbutz that responds to intruder alerts before handing over to the military.
Dafna's brother, Eitan Hadad, was part of that unit and rushed to help, leaving the couple in the safe room.
It would be the last time she saw him.
""He went out and we stayed in the safe room and it was just horror,"" she says.
""You didn't know what was going on, you just hear shooting all the time, bombs, a fight. And it doesn't stop for a minute.""
The response unit of roughly 10 people was clearly no match for the Hamas militants.
On WhatsApp, people reported more and more gunshots - and men speaking Arabic outside. The desperate pleas for help became more frequent.
""I'm home alone and I'm really scared,"" one resident wrote.
Elsewhere in the kibbutz, Shir Gutentag was trying to quietly comfort her eight-year-old and five-year-old daughters, while following the WhatsApp chat in disbelief.
""At first when I realised we have terrorists in the kibbutz I shook. I was in shock. But very quickly I thought to myself 'you have to stay calm', because they're looking at me, my children, and they see my reactions and they're starting to panic,"" she says.
""So I told them it's OK. It's going to be OK.""
Hours had passed since the attack started, and the crisis was only worsening. Hamas were breaking into people's homes and threatening safe rooms as members of the chat begged for help.
Michal was reading these pleas for help while also messaging her own family in a separate WhatsApp group. She shared the contents of this group with the BBC, giving a terrifying insight into one family's despair as they detailed the Hamas attack in real-time.
At around 09:30, Michal's mum wrote on the family chat that she could hear voices in Arabic outside their house. Within 15 minutes another message confirmed that Michal's dad had been hurt.
Michal, who had been trying to stay silent in her safe room until this point, simply could not keep quiet anymore and rang her mother. Her mum picked up the phone and whispered.
""'They're here, they shot Dad, he's not OK.'
""And then she hung up,'"" Michal says.
Her mother continued writing on the family chat: ""Help. Help.""
Hamas gunmen had used a weapon to break through the safe room door and had shot Michal's father as he tried to fight back. They then threw grenades.
Her mum wrote a final plea for help at 10:15. After that, messages from her children went unanswered. She had been killed too.
As her parents were being attacked, Michal was desperately messaging in the mothers' chat, calling for someone to help  them. She would continue posting messages about them throughout the day hoping that, somehow, they had survived.
She was not the only one. Others were continuously begging for someone, anyone, to check on their parents, friends, cousins. But nobody could: everyone was in the same situation, barricaded in their own mamads.
Guns and grenades were Hamas' weapons, but they also set homes on fire.
""The entire house is smoke,"" one resident wrote. ""What should I do… tell me what to do.""
""We have a fire inside the safe room"", ""The entire window of the safe room is black"", other messages read.
On the row of houses closest to Gaza, the home of Dafna's disabled dad, Meir Hadad, was being burned down.
In their own family chat, Meir's Filipina carer, 52-year-old Bhing Sol, pleaded with his children to find help.
""They're here,"" she wrote, referring to Hamas, in a message at 09:44.
""It was full of terrorists,"" Bhing later said, saying they looted the home before setting it on fire.
""The safe room was full of smoke. I keep on asking everyone to help us because maybe we'll be burnt alive. But nobody could help us because everyone is terrified.""
In the mothers' group, others also asked for help to be sent to Meir.
With little anybody could do to answer all these pleas they offered each other practical suggestions - small, homespun survival tips that sustained them, and perhaps even saved lives, in their most powerless moment.
This was the spirit of the WhatsApp group - not just today, but for the years it had existed. It was a place for mothers to vent, to give advice, to support one another.
""Entire house is full of smoke what should I do?"" someone asked. ""Try to put a wet cloth on your face. Or urine,"" another resident responded.
In another exchange, a resident wrote: ""I can't breathe in the house I think there's a fire here help urgently"".
""Stay in the safe room don't go out put a piece of cloth on your nose,"" a neighbour replied.
While 44-year-old Golan Abidbol's wife and children took shelter in the family's safe room, he stood with a gun in his kitchen, watching Hamas militants throw a molotov cocktail at another building. As he watched, he saw a family jump from the second-floor window and hurry to a neighbour's safe room.
""I was pumped up with adrenaline. If someone came to my house I would give them the fight of my life,"" he says.
""I sent pictures to the neighbour downstairs because his house started to burn. I told him: 'Now. I don't see anyone. It's a good time.' So he moved to another neighbour's shelter.""
Golan says this is the ""essence of the kibbutz"".
""We are one big family. If we need to open our door when there are terrorists outside and let the neighbours get in so they can survive, we will do it. No one even hesitated,"" he says.
At around midday, two or three men tried to enter Golan's house. He pulled the trigger. ""They returned a burst of fire on the house and then they left. I don't know why they decided to do it but they decided to leave and not engage me anymore,"" he says.
At the same time, harrowing messages in the group continued to show that Hamas were breaking into houses and trying to breach safe rooms. ""Firing at our safe room's door,"" one message read. ""Helppp. Anyone.""
Meanwhile, at the burning house of Bhing Sol and Meir Hadad, gunmen had begun shooting at the safe room as it filled with smoke.
""I took a risk - I opened the window of the safe room, thinking even a little bit of space and the air will come,"" Bhing says.
""They kept bombing, with a grenade or something, inside our house. I knew it was burning because the door was so hot it was like fire. But I kept holding the door with a blanket because I didn't know if they could open the door,"" she says.
Later in the day, in what Bhing describes as a miracle, a crack formed in the ceiling of the room and water started dripping through onto Meir's head. She grabbed his cheeks in joy after the first drops fell and rubbed her hands over her face.
As they waited, the pair could hear hostages being taken past them towards Gaza.
""I heard so many people that they brought outside, then I heard shouting, and then Hamas was laughing and rejoicing that they got someone,"" Bhing says.
The first reference on the mothers' chat to someone being kidnapped was at 12:09.
The BBC has verified footage taken on the day that shows Hamas militants leading five hostages, including an elderly woman, down the road in Be'eri kibbutz - we do not know what time this footage was taken. Israel says that in total 150 people have been kidnapped and taken to Gaza and it is unclear how many were taken from Be'eri kibbutz.
As some people were led away by Hamas, others wondered when the army would arrive.
Shir Gutentag was reading the messages, while trying to comfort her daughters by continually placing a hand on each of them.
""I heard voice messages of terrible things,"" she says. ""There was a woman saying her baby daughter was dead. She was crying for help. Another one saw her mother getting killed, and she's waiting in the safe room for many hours whispering for help saying 'save me, I don't want to die.'""
Other WhatsApp messages in the group tell of horrific injuries - including a family member bleeding from a massive wound.
There are many messages on this chat, including some describing injuries, but we have not been able to ascertain the fate of everyone who posted.
As they sat waiting in the safe rooms for Israeli soldiers to arrive, the residents continued to support one another.
Shir made quiet calls to neighbours who had posted messages showing they were in distress, saying ""breathe in with me"".
""I posted mainly encouraging things - I'm sure the army's there, I'm sure they're coming. Be patient. Breathe,"" she says.
Others in the group did the same.
In one exchange, someone asked: ""Is there something someone can say to calm us down?"" Within seconds a neighbour responded: ""I'll tell you,"" before describing how the army would be able to handle it.
At around 15:00, Shir got a call from neighbours asking to come into her home because theirs was filling with smoke.
She rushed over to her front door, and began dismantling a stack of furniture she had put against it to stop anyone entering and let the family of four through, ushering them to the safe room before reassembling the barricade. A few minutes later, another woman got in touch to ask to enter and Shir began the process again.
As her family waited for a rescue they weren't sure would happen, Michal said she put her hands on her three children and ""gave them little kisses, but quietly"".
A message on the WhatsApp group offered advice about how to keep children calm. The message said that fear is normal, and to calm children with a hug.
In the afternoon, updates shared in the group suggested that IDF soldiers had arrived, and were beginning to make headway. ""The soldiers are now fighting... Two other forces are on their way,"" one message just after 15:30 said.
People continued to post their addresses in the hope that someone would come to save them, adding brief information, such as ""terrorists hiding"".
But confusion continued to dominate and nobody seemed to know how many soldiers had arrived, or if they were an organised group who could begin to control the situation.
People reported hearing shouts of ""IDF, IDF!"" outside, but did not know whether this could be trusted. It could be Hamas in disguise, trying to tempt residents to open up.
Golan had continued standing with his gun in his kitchen and he said he could see militants with RPGs  shouting ""IDF, IDF.""
""I text my neighbours saying I didn't think it was IDF, they had an accent and they didn't dress appropriately - they wore the uniforms, but they didn't wear them right.""
This message was also being passed around in the group.
""They're also disguised as soldiers, do not answer anyone outside,"" one said.
As evening approached, messages became more hopeful. The sounds people were hearing from the safe rooms were shifting. Many were hearing more Hebrew voices.
They had been waiting for almost an entire day for help. In one of the first messages on the chat one member says people should not worry and that they didn't need the army - it would be all over soon. But a few minutes later, people were begging for soldiers to come.
Now that help had finally arrived, residents tried to coordinate with soldiers, calling out locations for IDF troops to be sent to fight.
Shortly before 18:00, a message was circulated saying the most senior forces in the army were handling the incident. ""Until now you were brave and amazing, keep staying in the safe rooms and the incident will end. Everyone is aware of the situation and information is coming through all the time.""
It was around this time that Bhing and Meir were rescued from their safe room. The house around them - where the family were playing board games the night before - was now ashes. Somehow, they had survived, trapped inside a tiny room as all their belongings burned.
Bhing turned as soldiers escorted them away, and took a photo on her phone of the remains.
Back in the group, a message was sent at 18:08 saying: ""They're beginning a process of evacuation."" This was followed by the first messages from people saying they had been saved.
But the process was slow. Many continued to plead for help long into the evening. ""Lots of bullets here too. It doesn't stop. Please they're here,"" one message just after 19:00 said.
The military arrived at Dafna's brother's apartment at 20:00, telling Dafna and her husband they would be rescued within an hour.
Members of the mothers' group began sharing code words the soldiers should say so residents could trust it was really them. People continued to worry that it was really Hamas trying to get into their homes.
Meanwhile, the sounds of gun battles continued. They were being told it was over but as they had spent a day seeing nothing but hearing everything, they felt they could not distinguish anything or trust anybody.
""They're not saying the code help us,"" one resident wrote.
When the military came to Michal's home, she initially refused to open the door. One of the people from the kibbutz's emergency call-up unit called Michal's husband to assure him it really was the IDF.
""They told him they're going to come back and they're going to shout. And he said tell them to shout our name and we will open,"" Michal says.
The soldiers formed a circle around the family and their pet dog, as they escorted them from the kibbutz.
""They told us 'we're going to go quiet and at some point you've got to cover your kids' eyes because there are a lot of bodies outside'.
""So we walked, with the dog and he was really, really quiet. It took us I think 15 minutes to get outside of the kibbutz where they gathered all the people. The soldiers came to each family like this, so it took a lot of time.""
She covered her children's eyes,  but Michal kept hers open.
""I wanted to look. I saw bodies. My husband said he saw bodies of people from the kibbutz, but I saw bodies of terrorists,"" she says.
Others couldn't bear seeing the remains of their community. ""I was looking down,"" says Shir. ""I think this saved my soul.""
As they waited to be taken away, a gunman opened fire nearby. It wasn't completely over.
The residents were brought on army trucks to a nearby town, before being moved on to a hotel at the Dead Sea.
Dafna, who had first seen the military at 20:00, wasn't rescued until after 01:00. She had spent the past 19 hours in such a heightened state of stress and horror that she had not worried too much about her brother. Later, she learned that he had died.
He was not the only one.
One woman who has been calling for help the entire day after Hamas broke into her house sent a flurry of posts around 17:00. They began with a haunting, whispered voice note: ""I need help.""
Others told her to hang in there.
At 18:00, she posted again.
""We must be evacuated,"" she said.
These were the last messages from her that the BBC saw on the WhatsApp chat. Her friends say she is either dead or kidnapped.
They look back to life before that first message - ""God forbid"" - to a time where their community was what they call a paradise. They describe a beautiful landscape, a community of mothers and friends that relied on each other and looked out for their neighbours.
Surviving residents say they are drawing strength from their broken community - but cannot forget those who have been lost.
""They are our friends, they are our family, they are everything to us,"" Golan says.
""We know them. They have been part of our lives since we were born and we want them back.""
The residents had built a community in kibbutz Be'eri over decades. To them, it felt unbreakable. Now, many do not know where to go and what to do.
""I don't know if we'll even have a home to go to after this,"" Dafna says.
""We were living in an illusion that we were safe.""

Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in Gaza,,BBC,By Ashitha Nagesh,"It was 04:30 on Sunday 22 October when Ahmed Alnaouq suddenly woke. He normally slept well, but he'd had a feeling something was wrong.
He glanced at his phone and saw lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in Gaza - all now erased and replaced with ""This message has been deleted."" Mr Alnaouq, confused, messaged one of them back from his home in London. The response - ""Are you good?"" with no explanation for the deleted texts - made him feel more uneasy. Ahmed called, and his friend broke the news.
Mr Alnaouq's father Nasri, three sisters, two brothers, a cousin, and 13 young nieces and nephews - 20 members of his family - had been killed by an Israeli air strike. He felt something worse than devastation - a feeling so awful he didn't have a word for it. His father, he said, was the person he ""loved most in his life"".
Most of the family had lived together in his father's home, where Mr Alnaouq himself was born. His three sisters had moved in temporarily for their own safety, because the house was south of the Wadi Gaza river.
But shortly after ordering civilians to shelter in the south, the Israeli military continued to target the area. It said it was striking a series of Hamas targets.
""Israel instructed people to go there because it was safer,"" Mr Alnaouq said. ""Then they bombed it.""
Ahmed Alnaouq moved to the UK four years ago after getting a scholarship to study for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. He now runs the organisation We Are Not Numbers, which pairs Palestinian writers with mentors in the West. He hadn't been able to see his father since leaving Gaza.
""I always said to myself that if something happened to my father before I was able to see him again, I would never forgive myself.""
For Mr Alnaouq, he has not just had his family ripped away - he has also been denied the ability to grieve.
""Usually when someone loses a family member, they will be able to go and attend their funeral, kiss them goodbye, see their faces for the last time,"" he said.
""But they are thousands of miles away. Still, after a week, nine of them are under rubble. No-one can take their bodies out from under the rubble. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like my heart is torn.""
He is one of many British Palestinians who, despite being 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Gaza, are feeling the war intensely.
Those whose relatives have survived the bombings are trying to track their family members' movements remotely, and to push for action from those in power. They're watching the war unfold on TV and their phones, while trying to remain hopeful that their loved ones are safe.
Basma Ghalayini, 40, is one such person. She is currently dealing with the intense anxiety of not knowing how her relatives are faring. Ms Ghalayini is in Manchester, but her brother and sister travelled to Gaza in September to visit their parents who work there.
When Hamas launched their attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Ms Ghalayini's mother was immediately concerned about the potential dangers to Basma's sister, who has a health condition and is reliant on certain medication.
""So she quickly took [my sister] to the Egyptian border and headed to Cairo. They made it through. The borders closed the very next day.""
Ms Ghalayini's brother Mohammed and their father stayed in Gaza, moving to Khan Younis in the south when Israel gave its evacuation order.
Aside from the risk of deadly rockets, water and food supplies are running extremely low. The UN has warned that civil order is ""starting to break down"".
Power in Khan Younis is also extremely limited. Ms Ghalayini said Mohammed had had to queue for five hours to charge his phone from a car battery.
For this reason, she said, she doesn't want to waste her brother's battery by texting him a lot. Instead, she asked him to switch on his ""last seen"" status on WhatsApp.
But that connection is fragile. On Friday evening, Israel launched strikes of a scale and intensity never seen before. Connectivity from Gaza was cut off almost completely. Their loved ones in the UK waited anxiously for Gaza's internet to return.
It was then another 42 hours before Ms Ghalayini finally heard from Mohammed.
While this is the most intense escalation of the conflict in recent years, for Palestinians and the diaspora, the pain they're feeling now is not new.
Ms Ghalayini told me her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son already know what bombs are.
""It's all part of being Palestinian,"" she explains. ""Any Palestinian child will know, because it's part of our lives.""
But when her daughter asks if her uncle and grandfather are safe, she tells her, ""Yes, they're safe.""
""I have to,"" she said. ""She'll just get worried.""
Karim Ali's colleagues literally bear the scars of Israel's previous attacks on Gaza.
The 24-year-old from London works with a para-cycling team based in Gaza called the Gaza Sunbirds. Everyone in the team lost their limbs in previous bombardments.
He said that he had been talking recently to one of the athletes who had been gathering body parts from those killed in the current violence.
""We're talking about an amputee on one leg having to go around to gather the body pieces of people from the building next door, because there's no one else to clear the rubble.""
There's also a feeling of frustration closer to home.
Ms Ghalayini said she feels let down by the UK media, including the BBC. She said she disagrees with some of its terminology, such as it sometimes referring to the ""Israel-Hamas war"".
""It's heavily misleading,"" she said, as thousands of Palestinians had been killed, including children - ""none of them affiliated with Hamas"".
Mr Ali said he feels his community isn't always treated with respect by politicians or the media, citing what he sees as their tendency to make Israel's attacks on Gaza seem ""justified and targeted"".
""We're doctors, we're teachers, we're lawyers, we're politicians, we're academics, we're volunteers,"" he said. ""I came to this country to study, I started a food bank, I started a mutual aid group during the pandemic. I've contributed to the culture of this country.
""Why are we being treated like we're nothing? Why are we being dehumanised?""
But for both Ms Ghalayini and Mr Ali, the overwhelming show of support from people who've gone on marches across the country has left them with some hope.
While Basma Ghalayini worries they risk being a bit of an ""echo chamber"", she said the marches help her feel ""reassured"".
""It makes me feel that there are people who are there for us, supporting us.""

"Israel Gaza war: Hamas-run health ministry says Gaza death toll passes 10,000",,BBC,By George Wright,"The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel started bombing it last month.
More than 4,000 of those killed were children, the ministry said.
The number surpasses the UN's figure of about 5,400 killed in Gaza in all of Israel's previous conflicts with Hamas since it took control of the territory in 2007.
Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed 1,400 people and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October.
It says it is destroying Hamas infrastructure and killing its fighters so that it will no longer be able to pose a threat to Israel.
US President Joe Biden has previously questioned the accuracy of the health ministry's figures, while the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say that ""any information provided by a terrorist organisation should be viewed with caution"".
Hamas is a proscribed terror organisation in many countries including the UK and US.
However, World Health Organization (WHO) regional emergency director Richard Brennan, based in Cairo, said last week he believed the figures provided by the health ministry were trustworthy.
""We're confident that the information management systems that the ministry of health has put in place over the years stand up to analysis,"" he said, adding ""the data over the years has been quite solid"".
On Sunday night, the Israeli military carried out one of its heaviest bombardments of the besieged Gaza Strip, saying on Monday that it had hit 450 targets over the past 24 hours.
The Hamas-run health ministry said ""more than 200 martyrs were reported in the overnight massacres"".
The director of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City told the BBC that people were using donkeys and their own cars to carry dead bodies, because communications had been cut and they could not reach ambulance services.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) charity said this was the ""third communications blackout"" in Gaza since the war began - and it had lost contact with its teams.
Communications were restored on Monday morning, but getting information from Gaza City remains difficult.
The Israeli military says its troops have reached the coastline in the south of Gaza City, in effect dividing the territory in two.
The heads of all major UN agencies have issued a rare joint statement calling for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", saying ""enough is enough"".
""For almost a month, the world has been watching the unfolding situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory in shock and horror at the spiralling numbers of lives lost and torn apart,"" the UN chiefs wrote.
The heads of organisations including Unicef, the WHO and the World Food Programme - as well as charities such as Save the Children - have described the ""horrific"" loss of life on both sides. They have also released a statement to demand the unconditional release of the hostages taken by Hamas during its 7 October attacks.
""However, the horrific killings of even more civilians in Gaza is an outrage, as is cutting off 2.2 million Palestinians from food, water, medicine, electricity and fuel.""
The statement added that 88 people working for UNRWA, the agency focused on Palestinian refugees, had been killed since 7 October - representing the highest number of UN fatalities ever recorded in a single conflict.
The UN - which is housing many of the 1.5 million displaced Gazans - says 48 of its sites across the Gaza Strip have been damaged since the war broke out.
Israel has rejected the idea of a ceasefire - for which its Arab neighbours have also been calling - and for a humanitarian pause, which is the solution favoured by its ally, the United States.
At the weekend, Mr Netanyahu said Israel rejected ""a temporary ceasefire that does not include the release of our hostages"" in a TV statement,minutes after a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
He said that Israel was ""continuing with all our force"" against Hamas.

Why did it take Israel so long to deal with Hamas's attack from Gaza?,,BBC,By Gordon Corera,"Where were the Israel Defense Forces, in those long hours as Hamas militants roamed at will around communities near Gaza, some are asking.
""The army completely failed as a quick-reaction force,"" one Israeli said, pointing to how some of the communities that came under attack had to rely on their own civilian protection forces while they waited for the military to arrive.
The full answer of why this happened will take some time to emerge. But it seems as if surprise, scale and speed overwhelmed defences which were patchy and unprepared for what they faced.
Surprise was crucial in Hamas's assault.
Israeli intelligence failed to get inside the planning by Hamas for the attack. The group seems to have undertaken a long-term programme of deception to give the impression it was incapable or unwilling to launch an ambitious attack.
It also practised good operational security, probably keeping off electronic communications.
Hamas then relied on the unprecedented scale and speed of what came next.
Thousands of rockets were launched as cover. But there were also drone strikes on the monitoring equipment that Israel uses on the border fence to watch what is happening. Heavy explosives and vehicles then created as many as 80 breaches in the security fence.
Motorised hang-gliders and motorbikes were also involved, as between 800 and 1,000 armed men flooded out of Gaza to attack multiple sites.
These swarming tactics seem to have succeeded in overwhelming Israel's defences - at least for a while.
Such a range of activity would have led to chaos within Israel's command and control centres, already quiet on a Saturday morning which was also a religious holiday.
Some of the Hamas fighters targeted civilian communities while others targeted military outposts. There has been shock that these outposts were so lightly-defended that they could be overrun, with images posted of Israeli tanks in Hamas hands.
And the holes in the border remained open for long enough to allow hostages to be taken into Gaza before tanks were eventually used to close them up.
Defences seem to have been patchy - Israeli security and defence forces had in recent months been more focused on the West Bank rather than Gaza, potentially leaving gaps. And Hamas may have counted on the divisions in Israeli society over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies to further distract the security establishment.
Israel's military and intelligence capability has long been rated as the best in the Middle East and one of the best in the world. But they may also have underestimated the abilities of their opponents.
The attacks have been compared to those of 9/11 in the US, when no-one had predicted that planes could be used as weapons. That was often called a ""failure of imagination"".
And a similar failure of imagination may also be one of the issues for Israel, leaving it unprepared for something so ambitious from its enemy.
Those concerns will certainly be part of the long-term inquiries that will likely take place. In the short term though, the focus will be on working out what to do next rather than looking back.

Jenin: Palestinians fear escalation after destructive West Bank assault,2023-07-05,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"The atmosphere in Jenin refugee camp feels like one I have witnessed elsewhere - in Gaza, after wars with Israel.
But this is the occupied West Bank; where the dynamics are very different. Now it seems like a fast descent into something far more dangerous is already happening.
The destruction in the camp following the Israeli army's biggest assault there in 20 years is massive.
As hundreds of troops entered the camp on Monday morning, the army fired missiles from drones - air strikes have not been used in the West Bank for two decades - and tore up roads to clear them of what it said were militants' roadside bombs.
Fierce gun battles broke out between the troops and Palestinian militants and continued until Israeli troops withdrew on Tuesday night.
Now for the first time in safety since Sunday, thousands of residents pour into the streets to see the destruction themselves.
They clamber over rubble, take photos on their phones of the wreckage and compare experiences, pointing out which homes were raided, whose sons have been detained, and where the dead fell. One man walks up to me saying it reminds him of pictures from Turkey and Syria earlier this year - after the earthquake.
Cars lie crushed and tossed aside where they were hewn out of the path of Israel's D9 armoured bulldozers. The tarmac is torn up, lying everywhere in huge chunks. We walk along what was underneath the streets: rubble, sand and dust.
Many homes have no water or power. Aid volunteers bring crates of bottled water. They join the recovery workers - some driving the few diggers available. One is removing a downed tree from the top of a residential building. It shears away part of the facade of a shop on the ground floor, falling perilously close to us.
The Israeli armoured convoys pulled out overnight amid intense gunfights with militants. Despite today's calm, everyone fears more is coming. Israel says it will keep doing these kinds of operations ""as long as necessary to uproot terrorism"" while Palestinian militant groups are claiming ""victory"" and vowing revenge.
We continue our way through the camp and the funeral processions begin. Thousands of mourners chant as they carry stretchers holding the bodies of some of the 12 Palestinians killed since Monday. Four of them were aged under 18. Israel said it was targeting militants.
Columns of people join. As they march, some men are masked and carrying guns; others wear Islamic Jihad headbands and Hamas flags flutter over a nearby building. Anger grips the crowd as it makes its way towards the homes of the dead, where their mothers and wives await.
But the displays of firepower - in public at least - feel less intense than previous funerals.
I have been coming to Jenin repeatedly over the last year and a half, as a new generation of armed militants has formed, rejecting the ageing Palestinian leadership and shooting at the Israeli army during its growing raids into the city.
This is a generation that believes the official Palestinian Authority (PA) sold out on their future and became little more than a security company for Israel's military occupation, which secures the expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank, built on the land Palestinians want for a future state and illegal under international law.
Less gunfire today, but the frustration only intensifies. Overnight young Palestinian men also clashed with the formal security forces of the PA. Jenin is a city that had already slipped well out of its limited control.
Now the institutional remnants of a three-decades old peace process in the occupied West Bank are being tested to destruction.
Israel says it will continue to root out what it calls ""a city of refuge for terrorism"" in Jenin, but the Palestinian militant factions say they will intensify their activities. A car-ramming and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday that wounded seven Israelis was described by Islamic Jihad as the ""first response"" to what was happening in Jenin.
The growing violence is a further sign of the collapse of any political horizons. Some fear that Palestinian cities in the West Bank will see more intensive military attacks and security crackdowns - more akin to the plight of people in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas and blockaded by Israel.
More Palestinians reject their own internationally recognised leadership and back armed resistance, while Israel remains in the grip of the most extreme government it has ever known, which has vowed to extend what it calls exclusive Jewish rights to all the land.

Israel-Gaza war: The Red Cross's delicate role in hostage crises,2023-11-27,BBC,By Imogen Foulkes,"With intense focus on the hostages released by Hamas, a quiet but crucial part has been played by an organisation at the centre of their handover, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Footage of the releases shows Red Cross staff, in their distinctive white vests emblazoned with its internationally recognised emblem, taking the hostages from masked gunmen, carefully helping them into their vehicles, giving them first aid and even playing with children in their first moments of freedom.
The organisation was in contact with Hamas ever since it seized about 240 people during its massive attack on Israel on 7 October and took them back to Gaza. It has repeatedly called for their release, or at least to allow the ICRC to visit them.
So far, 58 hostages - 40 Israeli and 12 Thais - have been released to the ICRC. The organisation was not involved in the negotiations around the terms for a release, but was standing by to facilitate the release once those terms had been agreed.
From Israel, there has been some criticism that the ICRC has not done more.
But the organisation said ""the ICRC cannot force its way in to where hostages are held, nor do we know their location"".
The statement reflects frustration in Geneva that not everyone understands what the Red Cross can and cannot do.
It is trying to fulfil its traditional role under the Geneva Conventions, asking to visit the hostages, deliver medical supplies, and bring news to desperate families. None of that can happen unless both Hamas and Israel agree. The ICRC is unarmed, and relies entirely on the trust of the warring parties - and civilians caught up in conflict - to carry out its work.
And in the same way as it has transported hostages out of Gaza, it has also taken to their West Bank homes Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange.
The logistics are a complicated but the ICRC is no stranger to such complexities. Last year it facilitated the release of almost 900 prisoners in Yemen held by Houthi rebels and Saudi-backed government troops.
The operation took two days; the ICRC visited each prisoner to ensure they were well enough to travel and actually wanted to return home and then chartered planes to fly into conflict zones to pick them up.
At the time Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's regional director for the Middle East, admitted how relieved he had been that the exchange went quite smoothly. Often, he said, the life of an aid worker is ""about frustration… it's about saying more often 'no' than 'yes'"".
The preparations the ICRC has been making for the Gaza hostages are part of a long history.
In the Red Cross museum in Geneva, there is an archive of six million registration cards, with details of the prisoners and the missing from two world wars.
It's a fascinating collection: one card confirms that Charles de Gaulle, France's World War Two leader and later its president, had been taken prisoner at the battle of Verdun in 1916. Others show the anxiety of mothers looking for their sons, and the sad replies confirming they had been killed.
The collection illustrates the ICRC's key role under the Geneva Conventions: tracing the dead and missing, visiting prisoners of war, checking on their welfare, and exchanging messages between POWs and their families.
In a quiet building in the hills above Geneva, the Red Cross tracing agency is now doing exactly the same for Russian and Ukrainian families as the war resulting from Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022 continues.
But in the century between World War One and today, the ICRC's work has expanded.
Warfare has changed. Traditional armies are often replaced by armed militias, and civilians as well as fighters are detained, abducted or simply go missing.
The Red Cross aim remains the same: to bring news of missing loved ones, and - if possible - to reunite families separated by war.
During Nelson Mandela's long imprisonment in apartheid South Africa, the ICRC visited him regularly on Robben Island.
Until the Good Friday agreement for peace and power sharing in Northern Ireland, the ICRC visited members of paramilitary groups who had been imprisoned there.
The Red Cross also helps with prisoner exchanges, and the release of those abducted or taken hostage.
When hundreds of schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria in 2014, the ICRC helped facilitate the release of some of them two years later.
But, as with the hostages in Gaza now, supporting, or facilitating, did not mean negotiating.
""We were not involved in the negotiation for their release… we transferred the girls with the agreement of both parties involved,"" the ICRC said at the time.
Mr Carboni, who accompanied his boss Mirjana Spoljaric to Qatar earlier this week, explained how the Red Cross sees its fundamental role, relatively unchanged for more than a century.
""I look at my kids, I look at my brothers, and I say 'imagine now there is a front line between us, they are captured, and I can't see them'. Or worse, you have no news, you don't know.
""So when we manage to reunite people, it's something hard to describe, this sense of purpose,"" he says.

West Bank: US 'troubled' by Israeli settlement expansion plans,,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"The Israeli government has advanced plans for some 5,700 new homes in the occupied West Bank.
The announcement comes despite US pressure to stop settlement expansion, which it sees as an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians.
A US spokesperson said Washington was ""deeply troubled"" by the development.
Four Israeli settlers were shot dead by Palestinians last week, prompting days of settler violence.
Violence between Palestinians and Israelis has flared since Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasre-elected last year.
His nationalist-religious coalition has vowed to extend its presence in the West Bank.
According to the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now, the last six months have seen more than 13,000 settlement homes advanced in the territory - about three times as many as in the whole of last year.
""The Israeli government is pushing us at an unprecedented pace towards the full annexation of the West Bank,"" the organisation said in a statement.
Most countries deem the settlements, which are built on land captured by Israel in 1967 in the Middle East War, to be illegal under international law, although Israel disagrees.
A US national security spokesperson denounced the expansion of the settlements, saying it ""undermines the geographic viability of a two-state solution, exacerbates tensions, and further harms trust between the two parties"".
The new plans include an extra thousand homes in the settlement of Eli, announced by the government after last week'sdeadly shooting of four Israelis by Palestinian gunmenthere.
Palestinian militant group Hamas said the gunmen were its members.
Mobs of settlerswent on the rampage in Palestinian villagesafter that attack - homes were set on fire and one Palestinian was killed.
Over the weekend, Israel's military, police and Shin Bet security service chiefs issued an unusual joint statement condemning the settler actions.
Their move provoked an angry response from far-right members of the Israeli governing coalition.

"Gaza 'soon without fuel, medicine and food' - Israel authorities",,BBC,By Rushdi Abu Alouf & Oliver Slow,"The Gaza Strip could be on the brink of a new humanitarian crisis if supplies are not allowed in, authorities say, as Israel responds to the Hamas attacks.
On Monday, Israel declared a ""complete siege"" on the territory, saying electricity, food, fuel and water would be cut off.
According to residents, aid has not reached the enclave since Saturday.
BBC footage shows deserted streets covered with rubble from collapsed buildings following Israeli airstrikes.
Nearly 700 people have died in these attacks and thousands more are reported to have been injured.
The area is home to about 2.3 million people in total - 80% of whom rely on humanitarian aid mainly due to the ongoing hostilities with Israel.
It is ruled by Hamas militants but Israel controls the airspace and its shoreline. It also restricts who and what goods can cross its borders.
Neighbouring Egypt strictly controls what or who can pass through its border with Gaza too.
Since the attacks began on Saturday morning, Israel has stopped all supplies entering Gaza, including food and medicine.
Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general, said more than a dozen healthcare workers had been killed or injured and at least seven medical centres had been damaged.
Meanwhile, many people are currently without electricity and internet, and could soon be out of essential food and water supplies.
""Damage to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities has undermined services to more than 400,000 people,"" said Mr Dujarric.
""The Gaza Power Plant is now the only source of electricity and could run out of fuel within days.""
He added that the World Food Programme was already distributing food for up to 100,000 internally displaced Palestinians and that these efforts would increase eight-fold in the coming days.
Even before the latest restrictions,residents of Gaza already facedwidespread food insecurity, restrictions on movement and water shortages.
Juliet Touma, a spokeswoman for the United Nations' Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), told the BBC people in Gaza were ""terrified"" by the current situation and worried for their safety - as well as that of their children and families.
On Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said it would impose a ""complete siege"" on the territory.
""No electricity, no food, no water, no gas - it's all closed,"" he said, adding that ""we are fighting animals and are acting accordingly.""
The Israeli infrastructure minister later ordered the immediate cut-off of water supplies to Gaza, saying: ""What was in the past will no longer be in the future.""
In a statement released before those announcements, the Palestinian health ministry said hospitals were facing a shortage of medicines, medical supplies and fuel due to Israel's actions.
It called on international actors to urge Israel to ""restart power lines"" and to supply emergency needs in the form of medicine, fuel and power generators.
Israel has launched massive retaliatory air strikes into Gaza in recent days. Sunday night saw a particularly heavy barrage of strikes, potentially the biggest Gaza has experienced in years.
Some of the strikes targeted the border area in the east of Gaza, from where Hamas launched their attacks on Saturday morning. Israel appears to be targeting those areas to try and shore up security there.
There have also been reports from witnesses of Israel using artillery fire in the border area.
Israel said it is striking Hamas targets in Gaza, but there are reports of civilians being hit.
The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign affairs said two refugee camps in Gaza - Al-Shati (also known as the Beach camp) and Jabalia camps - were hit by Israeli airstrikes, reportedly leaving several injured and dead.
Video shared online from Jabalia showed widespread chaos, including a body being carried away and a man covered in blood and dust.
The foreign ministry also said air strikes hit a United Nations school in Gaza that was housing hundreds of civilians, including children and the elderly.
TheUN confirmed the attack, saying the school was ""severely damaged"", but that no one was killed.
There have also been reports of a mosque, as well as homes, being hit.
According toAssociated Press, 19 members of the same family were killed in a strike in Rafah, in the south of Gaza.
The UN said on Monday 123,538 people in Gaza have been internally displaced, mostly ""due to fear, protection concerns and the destruction of their homes"".
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) added that 73,000 people are sheltering in schools.

Oil prices rise following Hamas attack on Israel,,BBC,By Annabelle Liang,"Oil prices have jumped on concerns that the situation in Israel and Gaza could disrupt output from the Middle East.
Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed by $2.25 a barrel to $86.83, while US prices also rose.
Israel and Palestinian territories are not oil producers but the Middle Eastern region accounts for almost a third of global supply.
Hamas's assault on Israel was the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.
Western nations condemned the attacks. A spokesperson for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, told the BBC that the group had direct backing for the move from Iran - one of the world's largest oil producers.
Iran denied involvement in the assault at a UN Security Council meeting in New York on Sunday, Reuters reported. But Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has expressed support for the attack.
On Monday, Israel ordered US oil giant Chevron to pause production at the Tamar natural gas field off the country's northern coast, which is within range of rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.
The country's energy ministry, which has closed the field during previous periods of unrest, said there was enough fuel from other sources to meet Israel's energy needs.
Israel's largest offshore gas field, Leviathan, continues to operate as normal, Chevron said.
Energy analyst Saul Kavonic told the BBC that global oil prices have risen ""due to the prospect of a wider conflagration that could spread to nearby major oil-producing nations such as Iran and Saudi Arabia"".
On Monday morning, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, was up $2.50 a barrel at $85.30.
""If the conflict envelops Iran, which has been accused of supporting the Hamas attacks, up to 3% of global oil supply is at risk,"" Mr Kavonic added.
Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC's Today programme that Iran had been increasing oil production over the course of this year despite US sanctions.
""The US seems to have turned a blind eye to a steady increase in Iranian production, that... is going to be more difficult for the US to ignore going forward from here,"" she said.
Overall, Ms Bain said Capital Economics expected demand for oil to exceed supply in the final three months of the year and ""that should support higher prices"".
Mr Kavonic said that about a fifth of global supply would be ""held hostage"" if passage through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil trading route is disrupted.
The Strait of Hormuz is crucial for the main oil exporters in the Gulf region, whose economies are built around oil and gas production.
Uncertainty over how events could develop in the coming days may also drive investments into US Treasury bonds and the dollar, which investors traditionally buy at times of crisis, said James Cheo from HSBC bank.
On Monday, Israel's central bank said it would sell up to $30bn of foreign currency in a bid to calm markets and support the country's own currency, the shekel, which has fallen sharply.
""At this stage, there is a bit of nervousness. [Investors] want to see a little more clarity, particularly on economic data and on developments associated with geopolitical uncertainty,"" added Mr Cheo.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year.
They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market.
Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer,said it would make cuts of a million barrels per day in July.
Other members of Opec+, a group of oil-producing countries, also agreed to continued cuts in production in an attempt to shore up flagging prices.
Opec+ accounts for around 40% of the world's crude oil and its decisions can have a major impact on oil prices.

What China wants from Israel-Hamas war,2023-10-31,BBC,By Tessa Wong,"As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.
China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.
Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.
There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to ""urge calm"" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.
China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare détente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it ""stands ready to strengthen communication with China"" on resolving the situation in Gaza.
As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.
In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. ""Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.""
But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics.
""China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,"" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.
China'sfirst statement on the conflictangered Israel which expressed ""deep disappointment"" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself.
Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.
Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.
After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that ""all countries have the right to self-defence"" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone ""beyond the scope of self-defence"".
China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause.
It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called ""national liberation"" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.
In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.
But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state.
One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.
The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease.
All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.
Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?
One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.
Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.
But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.
China believes that ""standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South"", pointed out Dr Murphy.
The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US ""hegemonic"" leadership.
Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is ""ginning up the nationalist response… tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,"" noted Dr Murphy.
Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of ""adding fuel to the fire"" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaperThe Global Times published a cartoonof Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.
One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its Western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.
There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.
One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.
Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.
The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.
China assumes that ""by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,"" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.
Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has ""no selfish interests on the Palestinian question"".
The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.

Tank seen on key Gaza road as Israeli forces push deeper into north,,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say.
One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.
A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.
Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be ""doing well"", as an ""exciting achievement"" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages.
He also condemned as ""cruel psychological propaganda"" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange.
The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.
Over the weekend, Israel began what Mr Netanyahu called the ""second stage"" of a war intended to destroy Hamas, with ground forces expanding their operations inside Gaza after three weeks of intense bombardment.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,300 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low.
Mr Netanyahu has also rejected calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying that to pause military operations would be ""to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism"".
""Today we draw a line between the forces of civilisation and the forces of barbarism,"" he told a news conference on Monday. ""Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until victory. I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight.""
Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.
The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning.
Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City.
He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.
The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion.
""He's gone, the whole family is gone,"" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.
A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: ""Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks."" He took a couple of pictures and then fled.
The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information.
""We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,"" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said.
""While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority.""
Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels.
Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 ""terror targets"" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.
The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period.
He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.
About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.
The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.
About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense.
Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.
The Palestinian Red Crescent posteda video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning.
The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, which is south of Gaza City, also saidit had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night.
There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as ""catastrophic"" by its chief of surgery.
Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were ""occupying each square metre"" of Al-Shifa and that it was ""overwhelmed"" by patients.
About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. ""But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people.""
The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation.
The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law.
""The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,"" he said.
He also warned thatthe looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehousesin central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how ""the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break"".
Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was ""not going to meet the requirements of Gaza"".
""We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,"" he added. ""But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.""

Where will Scotland's pro-Palestinian demos be held on Armistice Day?,,BBC,,"Thousands in Scotland are expected to join pro-Palestinian marches across the UK on Armistice Day on Saturday.
They are calling for a ceasefire in the war in Gaza, on the same day people gather to remember those who have died in military conflicts since World War One.
The UK government has branded the planned November 11 marches as""provocative and disrespectful"".
Protests began in London on 14 October, one week after Hamas launched an attack in Israel that killed 1,400 people and saw 229 held as hostages.
Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,800 Palestinians have been killed.
Where and when are the marches in Scotland?
In Scotland there have been protest marches over the last four weekends.
Pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central railway stations last Saturday.
And on Thursday, five people were arrested after a groupoccupied the roof of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.
First Minister Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law escaped from Gaza last week, has backed the right of protesters to hold events on Armistice Day.
The first minister also said he was ""beyond angry"" at the UK government wanting to ""drive every issue into a culture war"".
Marches are being organised by the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, an affiliate of the Scotland-wide Gaza Genocide Emergency Committee.
The campaigners rejected any suggestion that they would disrupt Armistice services. They told BBC Scotland they would be reading out World War One poetry and wearing black.
Protests are scheduled for Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Forres in Moray.
In Edinburgh, a short Armistice Day service is expected to start at 10:52 on Saturday in Princes Street Gardens. There will be two-minute silence at 11:00.
A pro-Palestinian protest is scheduled on nearby Waverley Bridge at 12:00
City of Edinburgh Council urged anyone organising a protest to get in contact and said it had waived the requirement of 28 days' notice for marches.
Council Leader Cammy Day said: ""The council supports the fundamental right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, as outlined in the European Convention on Human Rights.
""I'd urge any organisers to contact the council as soon as possible so we can work together to plan your demonstration in a in a safe, organised and efficient manner.""
Speaking toBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Dr Claire Armstrong, CEO of Legion Scotland, behind the Edinburgh remembrance event, said it would ""proceed as normal"" and security measures were in place.
She said: ""I think rather than concerns, it has created more of a positive reaction. We may see more people coming to events.""
Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said: ""Public safety is our priority and an appropriate policing plan is in place this weekend.
""We continue to engage with those organising demonstrations to ensure rights to peaceful assembly and protest are protected while minimising disruption to communities.
""Hate crime, violence or abuse do not represent legitimate protest and we will respond professionally to offending.""

"Israel-Gaza war: 'Dialogue is not easy, but we can't shut the door'",2023-11-01,BBC,By Lauren Hirst,"The Muslim Jewish Forum of Greater Manchester was set up almost two decades ago, when, as one member puts it, the communities ""had no communication with each other"".
Its aim has always been to develop cultural and social ties between the two communities in the region, something it saysthe Israel-Gaza warhas thrown into sharp focus.
""It is not easy for dialogue at the moment, but we can't shut the door on it,"" says Manchester councillor Rabnawaz Akbar, who sits on the forum's executive committee.
""There is anger and frustration because it's not just about the conflict now,"" he says.
""It's about the daily images people are seeing of civilians, children, women, old people. Nobody wants to see that.
""At the end of the day, humanity prevails everything.""
Since the conflict began on 7 October, the forum has been calling for all communities ""to act responsibly and to support and protect each other against any form of hatred and provocation"".
In a statement, it said people should ""unite in remembering that what we have in common far surpasses the differences in our culture and heritage"".
Salford councillor Heather Fletcher, the forum's Jewish co-chairwoman, toldBBC North West Tonightthat ""the way forward is always that people get to know each other [and] become friendly with each other, because it's ignorance that makes people intolerant"".
""Being familiar with people and being friendly with them and learning about each other's cultures makes people understand each other and it's understanding that's the key,"" she said.
She said it was important to make sure the message the forum published was acceptable to all communities.
""Just a couple of words out of place can make the whole thing sound different or upset one community or another community,"" she says.
David Berkley KC, a member of the forum's executive committee, said he had said to his friends from both faiths that ""were it not for that unequivocal statement from the forum, I certainly wouldn't be sitting at this table today"".
He said the group was about ""identifying those things we have in common and those things upon which we disagree"".
""One of the things that I think has made it possible to have an impact is our willingness to acknowledge that there was these issues, which we cannot ignore,"" he added.
""We have identified these issues and been willing to have an open and honest discussion about the things that matter to us.""
Mohammed Amin, the forum's Muslim co-chairman, said since it was launched almost two decades ago, he had noticed a ""change in atmosphere as a consequence of our activities"".
""I didn't have any social contact with Jewish people as an adult,"" he said.
""In 50 years, I had never set foot inside a synagogue and helping to set up the forum has transformed my life in terms of expanding my understanding.
""As far as Manchester is concerned, we made it much more normal for Muslims and Jews to do things together.""

Sharone Lifschitz: 'Incredible thing' to see mother after her release by Hamas,,BBC,,"Sharone Lifschitz, the daughter of Yocheved Lifschitz, says the way that her mother held one of her captor's hands was ""incredible"" and ""so her"".
Yocheved Lifschitz was taken hostage during the 7 October attack on Israel, by Hamas, and was released on Monday. Speaking to Radio 4 Today, her daughter said she was sharp and keen to share information that may help lead to the release of other hostages.
At a press conference after her release, Lifschitz described how she was beaten, but otherwise ""treated well"" while captive.
Lifschitz's husband is one of those still being held by Hamas.

George Washington University protest on Israel-Gaza war stirs outrage,,BBC,By Jude Sheerin,"A prestigious US college has disavowed a campus protest over the Israel-Gaza war after it provoked accusations of antisemitism.
Police were called on Tuesday night to stop demonstrators projecting slogans on to the side of a library at George Washington University.
The college said the protest had violated its policy and caused ""distress"" to some students.
Israel has been bombarding Gaza since a Hamas attack killed 1,400 people.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says almost 6,500 people have been killed in the territory since then.
One of the messages beamed on to the building in Washington DC said, ""Free Palestine from the river to the sea"".
Activists say the phrase is a pro-Palestinian independence rallying cry, but the Anti-Defamation League, an anti-hate watchdog, has described it as code for the destruction of the state of Israel.
Other messages projected in big white letters on to the Gelman Library included ""End the siege on Gaza"" and ""Divest from Zionist genocide now"".
""Glory to our martyrs"" was another phrase that appeared. Demonstrators toldthe college newspaper, the GW Hatchetthat this slogan referred to any Palestinian killed by Israel, and not Hamas gunmen.
StopAntisemitism, an antisemitism watchdog, called on the university to expel the students involved.
""Demonstrations like this cloak themselves in politics to evade responsibility for what they really are: celebrations of murder,"" said its director, Liora Rez, in a statement to the BBC.
The universitysaid in a statementon Wednesday that the unauthorised protest had violated its policy.
""The statements made by these individuals in no way reflect the views of the university,"" said the college.
""We are reviewing this incident and will take any appropriate steps with respect to the individuals involved in accordance with university policies.
""We recognize the distress, hurt, and pain this has caused for many members of our community.""
According to the GW Hatchet, university aides and two campus police officers asked four members of Students for Justice in Palestine to stop the protest, which lasted about two hours.
Students for Justice in Palestine did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
But a spokesperson for the group told the Hachet newspaper: ""I feel very frustrated with how the university has responded.
""They have consistently shown that they do not respect our lives. They do not respect our right to free speech.""

Blinken steps up call for Israel to spare civilians in strongest remarks yet,,BBC,By Barbara Plett Usher,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has clearly laid out benchmarks for the protection of civilians in Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.
In the strongest and most specific US remarks yet, Mr Blinken said he'd told the Israeli government that it must avoid further mass displacement of Palestinians and damage to critical infrastructure, like hospitals, power stations and water facilities.
He did not, however, appear to set down red lines that would trigger US actions.
The secretary of state travelled to Israel to deliver the message - his fourth visit since the conflict began - at a time when hostilities have been paused by a deal to release hostages captured by Hamas.
Mr Blinken accepted that Israel planned to resume its military operation, but he also ""underscored the imperative for the United States that the massive loss of civilian life and displacement of the scale that we saw in northern Gaza not be repeated in the south"".
Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October killed 1,200 people with around 240 others taken hostage. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says Israel has killed more than 14,800 Palestinians in its retaliatory campaign, including about 6,000 children.
Israeli military strikes have hit hospitals and schools and rendered northern Gaza a moonscape of destruction.
The unfolding devastation has shifted the approach of President Joe Biden's administration, from unequivocal support for Israel right after the attack, to a growing emphasis on civilian protection and a focus on alleviating the desperate humanitarian conditions in Gaza.
That evolution has been propelled by anger from Arab allies, and significant dissent to Mr Biden's policies within the administration itself.
Senior officials had been previewing Mr Blinken's message for a more surgical approach when Israel focuses its offensive on southern Gaza, where more than 1.5 million Palestinians have fled to escape bombing in the north.
Further displacement of Palestinians would be ""beyond the capacity of any humanitarian support network to cope with"", said one.
He clarified that safe zones needed to involve multiple places near UN facilities and shelters, not a single area for the mass relocation of civilians, as initially proposed by the Israeli government.
They will be more like neighbourhood de-confliction zones, said another official after Mr Blinken's meetings.
The secretary of state also underlined that there must be room to sustain and build on the humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza.
But he avoided a question about whether he'd imposed a timeline for the military operation, stating instead that Israel agreed with the US approach.
He said Washington supported Israel's goal to neutralise the threat posed by Hamas, and highlighted the complexity of such a task when the Palestinian militants are embedded amongst the civilian population.
Earlier this week the administration clarified that it was not prepared to use its ultimate leverage - placing conditions on America's massive military assistance to Israel - which is powering the war.
This is what a dozen or so Democratic senators were told when they questioned whether Israel's use of the weaponry complied with American law, according to one who attended a meeting with the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
A senior US official said threatening aid to Israel was not an effective approach, but its leaders pay attention to what the US says.
The emphasis has been for President Biden to use his influence as Israel's strongest ally to privately push Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on humanitarian issues.
Mr Blinken has been unusually public about this.
The next phase of the war will reveal whether Israel has got the message.

First fuel tanker enters Gaza from Egypt since start of war,,BBC,By David Gritten,"A tanker has delivered fuel to Gaza for the first time since the war between Hamas and Israel began five weeks ago.
A senior UN official said it had received 23,000 litres (5,060 gallons) of fuel via Egypt's Rafah crossing.
But he warned that Israeli authorities had restricted its use to transporting aid into Gaza, and that none could be used to power hospitals or water pumps.
Israel has been blocking all deliveries of fuel, saying it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes.
An Israeli defence ministry body said it had agreed to allow UN aid lorries to be refuelled following a request from the US government.
The decision came hours after Israeli troops raided Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which has been the focus of days of fighting and seen nearby air strikes.
Israel launched a major military campaign to destroy Hamas - which it classes as a terrorist group - and began a siege of Gaza in retaliation for a cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,000 people have been killed in the territory since then and the UN has warned of a ""humanitarian disaster"".
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza - said on Tuesday that the lack of fuel meant it could no longer unload or distribute aid from lorries that arrived at Rafah.
Although Wednesday's delivery means the UN will now be able to fill up its vehicles, Israel has banned it from using any of the fuel to provide basic services to 1.5 million people who have fled their homes, more than half of which are sheltering in Unrwa facilities.
""Our entire operation is now on the verge of collapse,""Unrwa's Commissioner General, Philippe Lazzarini, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
""By the end of today, around 70% of the population in Gaza won't have access to clean water,"" he added. ""To have fuel for trucks only will not save lives anymore. Waiting longer will cost lives.""
The agency's Gaza chief, Thomas White, said 23,000 litres represented only 9% of what it needed daily to sustain life-saving activities and demanded that aid ""be delivered based upon need - not based upon conditions set by parties to a conflict"".
Earlier, Mr White said all three sewage pumps and 10 water pumps in the southern town of Rafah had stopped working because they had run out of fuel, as had the desalinisation plant in the nearby city of Khan Younis.
Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis has also been forced to halt all services except for emergencies and 24 ambulances have been taken out of service.
Many other health, water and sanitation facilities have already been forced to shut down across the Strip due to lack of fuel, damage, attacks and insecurity.
Palestinian telecommunications firms have also said that they expect to switch off phone and internet services on Thursday due to a lack of fuel for data centres and exchanges, according to the UN.
The Netblocks internet observatory said on Wednesday thatmetrics showed a new gradual decline in internet connectivity in Gazaand that residents' ability to communicate was likely to be reduced.
On Tuesday, 91 lorries carrying food, medicines, health supplies, bottled water, blankets, tents and hygiene products entered Gaza from Egypt,the UN said, bringing the total since the Rafah crossing reopened on 21 October to 1,187.
The UN has described that as a ""drop in the ocean"", noting that about 500 lorries would cross into Gaza each day on average before the war began.

Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt fails to open for foreigners,,BBC,By Robert Plummer,"The exit of foreigners from Gaza via the Rafah border crossing was halted on Saturday in an apparent dispute over evacuating injured patients.
Hundreds of foreign citizens have escaped through the crossing into Egypt in the past few days.
But on Saturday, no foreign nationals, dual nationals or injured patients were let through, Palestinian sources said.
Hundreds of people with foreign passports went to the border, but the gate did not open.
Sources from the crossing authorities on the Palestinian side told the BBC that movement of people with foreign passports is not being allowed until there is agreement on the safety of transferring injured patients.
There has been no official statement from the authorities as yet.
The UK Foreign Office confirmed that British citizens in Gaza had been unable to leave via the Rafah crossing.
A spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are disappointed that the Rafah crossing has been temporarily closed today.
""This continues to be a complex and challenging situation and we are using all diplomatic channels to press for its reopening in coordination with our international partners.""
The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on Wednesday to allow a number of civilians to leave Gaza.
It was their first opportunity to do so since the war began on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen staged an unprecedented assault on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people.
Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a ""complete siege"" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 9,488 people have been killed.
Rafah is the southernmost post of exit from Gaza and borders Egypt's Sinai peninsula.
Mohammed Ghalayini, a British scientist from Manchester who had been in Gaza visiting family when the war began, accompanied his uncle to the crossing earlier this week after he was named by Gaza authorities on the list of approved evacuees.
""People are really afraid of what's going on and so if they have a chance to leave, they're trying to leave,"" he told the BBC.
""But getting to the border is a struggle as well, because fuel supplies are short,"" he added. ""So you know, I saw people arriving on a donkey cart with their luggage at the border.""
The crossing, which has been open and shut frequently over the years, is now also the only crossing point for humanitarian aid.
Israel has not allowed any fuel shipments to enter the Strip since the start of the war. It has also cut off electricity supplies, prompting calls from UN agencies for fuel supplies to be let into Gaza to power basic services.
But on Saturday, US special envoy David Satterfield told reporters that when the fuel runs out in Gaza, there is an agreed mechanism to bring more in.
On Friday, an ambulance that had been attempting to transport an injured person to the Rafah border crossing was hit outside Gaza City's biggest hospital, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.
The agency says 15 people were killed in the incident.
The Israeli military said a number of Hamas fighters had been killed and accused Hamas - which is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other powers - of transferring militants and weapons in ambulances, although it has not yet supplied evidence of this.

Saturday saw a pro-Palestinian march in Cardiff city centre for the fifth weekend in a row over the Gaza war.
The museum apologised for any inconvenience, but said it shut the doors to protect the safety of visitors and staff.
It said people could still access the museum via the Reardon Smith Theatre on the side of the building, and they would open the front doors as soon as it was safe to do so.
Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas, which it considers a terrorist group, in retaliation for the 7 October cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen.
At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's assault on Israel and about 240 others were taken hostage.
Since Israel started its counterattack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory and the United Nations has warned of a ""humanitarian disaster"".

People struggle to leave Israel as flights book up,,BBC,"By Michael Race, Katy Austin & Jonathan Josephs","Securing direct flights from Israel to the UK has become increasingly difficult with more airlines cancelling flights after the Hamas attacks.
Virgin is now operating one flight to and from Tel Aviv a day instead of two and BA is flying one round trip.
EasyJet, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have suspended flights from Israel into the UK.
One travel agent said he been ""inundated"" with calls from people trying to get flights back to the UK.
Jeremy Segel, director of West End Travel, which specialises in trips to Israel, said many flights were booked up with only the ""odd seat"" available.
He arrived back in the UK on Monday with his family who had travelled as part of a 44-strong group to celebrate the Jewish festival of Sukkot.
While his BA flight was delayed, Mr Segel told the BBC people were ""panicking"" in Ben Gurion Airport as they learned of flights being cancelled.  At one stage, ""everyone started running"" in the airport over a false alarm of an attack.
""People are very nervous, people are very defensive,"" he said.
BA's website shows that its earliest flight to the UK from Ben Gurion Airport is on Monday 16 October and a one-way ticket costing more than £1,300. For the following Monday, a ticket is about £226.
Virgin Atlantic and Israel's national carrier El Al - which is still operating two flights daily to London Heathrow and two to Luton Airport - have no availability on their UK-bound services until next week.
Several airlines have introduced flexible booking policies and allowed customers to change travel dates for free.
Flightradar24, a website which tracks flights, told the BBC many airlines had cancelled journeys due to safety concerns. But it pointed out that the airspace over Israel isn't closed, so the number of flights flying to or from Tel Aviv ""is currently down to individual operators"".
Despite a dwindling number of direct flights leaving Israel, Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, urged UK nationals wishing to leave to use commercial transport, with no UK government evacuation currently planned.
The Foreign Office is advising against all butessential travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories,and against all travel to certain parts of the region.
""There are air flights, and of course there are land borders with friendly nations - with Egypt, with Jordan,"" Mr Cleverly said. ""If you seek to leave Israel we are working with the air industry and with Israeli air traffic control to maintain those flights.""
One woman from London, who asked the BBC to withhold her name, remains in Tel Aviv along with her husband, another adult couple and 12 children.
She said the group was ""going through a lot of trauma"" and had been forced to search for places to hide when air-raid sirens had sounded. The children especially were ""shaking from fear"".
""I can't tell you about the fear we are living through,"" she said. ""We have been trying to contact anyone to get us home.""
She said she had tried to call the British Embassy in Israel but had received no reply.
""We are very disappointed as we live in England and no one is willing to help us get back safely,"" she said. ""What are we supposed to do in this time of war?""
Asked if the government's policy on not currently facilitating an evacuation from Israel for UK citizens could change, Mr Cleverly said the situation in Israel was ""very fast moving"".
""I'm not able to speculate as to what might happen in the future.""

US warns Israel against reoccupying Gaza after war,,BBC,By David Gritten,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that Israel cannot reoccupy Gaza after the war with Hamas ends.
Mr Blinken also insisted Hamas could not continue to rule there as it risked a repetition of the 7 October attacks.
He said there should be no forced displacement, blockade or reduction of territory, and that the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority should govern.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israelwill have ""overall security responsibility"" for Gaza indefinitely.
He did not elaborate on what that would entail when he made the comment in an TV interview on Monday, but a senior Israeli official told reporters in Washington on Tuesday that Israel had no intention of reoccupying Gaza or controlling it for ""a long time"".
Israel has been bombarding the territory for a month and began a major ground offensive over a week ago with the objective of destroying Hamas, which it, the US and other Western powers consider a terrorist organisation.
The war began after an unprecedented cross-border assault on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 10,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while the UN is warning that an ""unfolding catastrophe"" is making a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent.
At a meeting in Tokyo, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy nations declared that they supported ""humanitarian pauses and corridors to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement and the release of hostages"". But they stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.
At a news conference afterwards, Mr Blinken set out the Biden administration's position on what a post-conflict Gaza should look like.
""The United States believes key elements should include no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Not now. Not after the war,"" he said.
""No use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks. No reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends. No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. No reduction in the territory of Gaza.""
""We must also ensure no terrorist threats can emanate from the West Bank.""
The secretary of state said ""affirmative elements"" were necessary for a ""sustained peace"".
""It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority,"" he said.
""And it must include a sustained mechanism for reconstruction in Gaza, and a pathway to Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side in states of their own, with equal measures of security, freedom, opportunity and dignity.""
When asked about the Israeli prime minister's comments, he said there would need to be a ""transition period at the end of the conflict"" but that he did not believe Israel intended to reoccupy and govern Gaza.
Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war. Although it withdrew its forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005, the UN still considers the territory occupied because Israel retains control over its air space, coastal waters and shared border.
On Tuesday, Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer clarified to the BBC what Mr Netanyahu had meant by ""security responsibility"".
""Governance requires an administration we assume will be Palestinian,"" he said. ""There's a question of the overriding security responsibility, that's what he was talking about, to ensure that in a post-Hamas Gaza we don't have the re-emergence of a terror threat from in Gaza.""
""Israel wasn't operating or doing any operations in Gaza, and we saw what happened over nearly two decades,"" he added. ""They built this terror state right on the south of Israel and we saw the effects of this.""
He also doubted whether the Palestinian Authority - which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under full Israeli control and is dominated by the Fatah movement, Hamas's rival - was the right body to govern Gaza.
""They haven't shown their ability there to actively fight terrorism,"" he added.
Mustafa Barghouti, head of the Palestinian National Initiative, was sceptical about what Mr Netanyahu was saying in public.
""When he says that he wants to keep the security control of Gaza forever that means he's planning to annex Gaza to Israel,"" he told the BBC.
Mr Barghouti said Palestinians needed a unified leadership that ""could prepare the ground for free democratic elections and end the occupation, not only of Gaza Strip but also of the West Bank and East Jerusalem"".
On the ground on Wednesday, the UN said thousands more people had fled northern areas as Israeli troops battled Hamas fighters deep inside Gaza City.
For a second day, crowds were seen walking southwards along Salah al-Din Road during a window announced by the Israeli military.
Many said they had run out of food and water or were frightened by news of Israeli forces' advances, while UN monitors reported that some had to cross Israeli checkpoints, where they saw people arrested.
Israel's military is focusing its operations on Gaza City, where it claims Hamas has its central command and a vast network of tunnels.
Hundreds of thousands of people have now heeded Israeli orders to move to the south since the war began, although in recent days Israel has continued to strike what it says are Hamas targets there and civilians have been killed.

Israel Gaza: TDs reject call to expel Israel's ambassador,,BBC,,"A motion which called for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador to Ireland has been rejected in the Irish parliament.
Social Democrat leader Holly Cairns, who tabled her party's motion, said ""despite the overwhelming support of the Irish people, this government has chosen not to act"".
An Irish diplomatic team is stationed at the crossing and would bring arrivals to Cairo, where medical assistance has been arranged, Micheál Martin continued.
In the UK Parliament, MPs voted to reject a call for an immediate ceasefire on Wednesday evening.
On Monday, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar reiterated his government's call for Hamas to release all hostages immediately.
A father-of-two whose family was among a number of Irish-Palestinians on a list to leave Gaza said it feels ""like God chose you to survive"".
Mr Shaheen said he had been contacted by staff from the Irish government who confirmed that his family was included on the list of international citizens who would be allowed to cross from Gaza to Egypt.
Mr Shaheen said life in Gaza had been turned upside down since Israel began bombing the territory in early October.
Another Irish-Palestinian father of two, who grew up in Belfast, has called for the Irish government to put his children on the evacuation list.
""I am begging them to put my children's names on the next list and to make sure they will be safe when they reach the border crossing,"" he told RTÉ.

Footage shows scale of destruction after Israeli air strikes on Gaza,,BBC,,"Footage shows the aftermath of Israeli air strikes on Gaza, where a mosque was completely destroyed.
Israel launched retaliatory strikes against Hamas after the militant group launched a series of attacks on Saturday, in the biggest escalation in the region in decades.
According to Palestinian officials, Israeli air strikes have killed at least 313 people in the Gaza Strip, with almost 2,000 wounded.
In Israel, more than 600 people have been killed, and dozens of Israelis have been taken hostage.

Palestinian gunmen among three killed in Israeli Nablus raid,,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"Three Palestinians have been shot dead and several wounded by Israeli forces in Nablus, in the occupied West Bank.
Witnesses described hearing gunfire and explosions as Israeli troops raided several houses in the crowded Balata refugee camp, in what they said was the biggest operation there in years.
The Israeli military says gunmen shot at its soldiers, who returned fire.
It says the soldiers found three M16 rifles, ammunition and an explosives workshop. Three arrests were made.
Israeli-Palestinian violence has been intensifying for months with near-nightly Israeli military raids in the West Bank and rising settler violence as well as a series of deadly attacks by Palestinians on Israelis.
Funerals have taken place for the three men who were killed during the latest raid in Nablus. Two have been identified as fighters from the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction.
Palestinian sources say these two men were killed in an exchange of fire with Israeli forces, while it was unclear if the third man had joined in the fighting.
Security camera footage being shared on social media, which cannot immediately be independently verified by the BBC, appears to show that one man was unarmed when shot while approaching a soldier.
Palestinian reports said that Israeli troops entered Balata camp accompanied by bulldozers and that they blocked ambulances from entering.
""All night we didn't sleep, we stayed awake, we were afraid, in horror,"" a resident of the camp, Um Abdullah, told al-Quds TV.
""We were sitting inside the house and a friend of my son called to say: 'They're going to demolish the house next-door, you need to leave.' Within a few seconds they demolished the house and our windows and doors fell down. We stayed inside and then ran away.""
In a statement, the spokesman for the Palestinian presidency, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, condemned what he called ""a real massacre and a continuation of the all-out war Israel is waging against the Palestinian people"".
He called for the US administration to intervene to put a stop ""to the Israeli madness that will drag the region towards an explosion"".
Overnight, the Israeli military says it made more than a dozen arrests across the West Bank, including three in Jenin. Like Nablus, Jenin has recently seen a concentration of Israeli army raids and has been a hotbed for Palestinian militants.
On Sunday, the Israeli military said a soldier was lightly wounded in a car ramming attack in the village of Hawara, close to Nablus. A search for the driver is continuing.
Earlier this month, two Palestinians were killed and others wounded by Israeli army gunfire during another arrest raid in Balata camp.

Bodies line corridors as Gaza hospital warns it's at breaking point,,BBC,By Adnan Elbursh,"Gaza City's main hospital, Al Shifa, is at full capacity.
The hallways and courtyards are filled with hundreds of bodies, as the morgue's refrigerators cannot hold them all. More bodies still lie outside.
Inside, hundreds of seriously injured people fill the hallways as staff work under immense pressure, knowing that all services might soon grind to a halt if its back-up generators stop working. Women and children are among the wounded.
This could lead to a serious catastrophe.
At the hospital, we see a young girl who has been brought in screaming from intense pain and shock. She calls out to doctors to treat her and to get rid of her pain.
Her home was unexpectedly shelled by Israeli forces, and a number of her relatives were killed.
But doctors are racing against time, and focus on giving priority to those who have been most seriously injured.
For others it is too late.
One woman sits next to the bodies of some of her relatives, who also died in a fierce Israeli bombardment which targeted a densely populated neighbourhood of Gaza. Surviving family members are arriving one by one.
""We were sleeping and they bombarded our house like everyone else,"" she says. ""They hit our house while we were sleeping. We didn't have any fighters [in our building]. The building is full of civilians - 120 people live there.""
Another woman on a stretcher tell us: ""They postponed my operation, they said other people were more of a priority… you can wait a bit. What can I do? [There are] so many people injured here.""
The head of the hospital, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmia, tells the BBC of the consequences if al-Shifa is forced to stop operating: ""The hospital cannot function without electricity.
""More than 120 people are intubated in the ICU, neonatal and other wards; [if this happens,] all departments and services across the hospital will collapse, and we will no longer be able to treat patients.""
As we report from the hospital, we discover that dozens of our own neighbours, relatives and friends are among those injured and killed.
We have to stop working as we process the shock of the story coming so close to us.
Cameraman Mahmoud al-Ajrami is overwhelmed and tears run down his face when he discovers a friend has been brought to the hospital after surviving serious injuries, and that most of the man's relatives have been killed.
The Palestinian ministry of health says it is working under immense pressure, conscious of the risk that hospitals in Gaza will soon be unable to function because of the power shutdown.

US $6bn deal with Iran under scrutiny in wake of Hamas attack on Israel,2023-10-12,BBC,By Jude Sheerin & Barbara Plett Usher,"The US says Iran has not accessed money agreed in a prisoner swap as the White House faces renewed criticism over the deal amid claims Tehran instigated a Hamas attack on Israel last weekend.
Washington has a ""quiet understanding"" with go-between Qatar not to free up any of $6bn (£.4.9bn) from the pact, the BBC's US partner CBS reports.
Iran's mission to the UN said the US cannot renege on the agreement.
The US has said it has no evidence of a direct Iran link to the Hamas assault.
The $6bn of Iranian oil funds held in South Korea were unfrozen in September as part of a deal that saw five US-Iranian citizens freed from captivity.
US President Joe Biden's officials have pushed back strongly against Republican criticism that the fund empowered Iran's support for Hamas.
On Thursday morning, Deputy US Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told House of Representatives Democrats behind closed doors that the money ""isn't going anywhere anytime soon"".
But later in the day, White House spokesman John Kirby would not confirm reports that the funds had been frozen.
""What I can tell you,"" he said, ""is none of it has been accessed and we are watching every dime as you would expect.
""We were watching it very, very closely.""
Neither would US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken confirm the money had been frozen as he visited Tel Aviv on Thursday.
He instead listed the ""facts"" about the account in a weary voice when asked about the matter by journalists.
America's top diplomat said it was Iran's money from oil sales, that it was held in Qatar and that it was only for food and medicine and that the US has to approve every transaction.
It is a complicated mechanism that has not yet been activated.
Any such freeze would be a provocative one at a time when the US is trying to prevent Iran and the militant groups it backs from joining the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Analysts warn such a move could embolden hardliners in Iran.
US officials would also probably be concerned a freeze of the fund would lead Iran to arrest more US-Iranian citizens.
National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday that Iran had played a role in the attack by funding the military wing of Hamas over the years.
But US officials have also said they cannot corroborate reports of direct involvement in the attack by Iran, which is Israel's arch-enemy.
President Biden has been under pressure from within his party to stop the funds going to Iran.
Democratic senators who are facing re-election next year have joined Republican calls for the US president to effectively break the deal.
But Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a statement reported by the Washington Post: ""The senators in question and the US government are all acutely aware that they can NOT renege on the agreement.
""The money rightfully belongs to the people of Iran, earmarked for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to facilitate the acquisition of all essential and non-sanctioned requisites for the Iranians.""

Biden criticises 'most extreme' ministers in Israeli government,,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israeli ministers have criticised the US president, after he said their government contained ""some of the most extreme"" members he had ever seen.
Joe Biden told CNN that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had ""problems in terms of his coalition""when asked why he had yet to visit the White House.
Mr Netanyahu's nationalist-religious coalition includes far-right parties.
The leader of one of them, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, denied that he was an extremist.
Mr Ben-Gvir, who has convictions for racist incitement and supporting a terrorist organisation, also warned Mr Biden that he ""needs to realise that we [Israel] are no longer a star on the American flag"".
Energy Minister Israel Katz, a member of Mr Netanyahu's Likud party, said the US president ""knows the rules of democracy"".
He also noted a decision by Mr Netanyahu's security cabinet on Sunday to ""act to prevent the collapse of the Palestinian Authority"". Mr Ben-Gvir voted against the move, while another far-right minister abstained.
Mr Biden also said in the CNN interview that the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank that are not under full Israeli control, had ""lost its credibility"" and ""created a vacuum for extremism among the Palestinians"".
""So, it is not all Israel now in the West Bank, all Israel's problem. But they are a part of the problem, particularly those individuals in the cabinet who say: 'We can settle anywhere we want; they have no right to be here, etc.'""
""We are talking with them regularly, trying to tamp down what is going on. Hopefully, Bibi will continue move toward moderation and change,"" he added, using the Israeli prime minister's nickname.
Mr Netanyahu returned to power at the end of December, leading the most right-wing government in Israel's history.
It immediately faced condemnation from Palestinians and human rights groups for stating that the Jewish people had an ""unquestionable right to all areas of the Land of Israel"", including the occupied West Bank.
Since then, the government has advanced plans for 13,000 new housing units at settlements across the West Bank, according to the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now. That is three times as many as in the whole of last year.
Most countries deem the settlements, which are built on land captured by Israel in 1967 in the Middle East War, to be illegal under international law, although Israel disagrees.
The Biden administration warned last month that the settlement expansion was undermining the viability of the two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict - the long-standing international formula for peace - as well as exacerbating tensions and harming trust between the two parties.
The past seven months have also seen a surge of deadly violence in the region.
On Monday, the Israeli military said its troops had shot dead a Palestinian man who threw a grenade and opened fired at them near the village of Deir Nidham.
The incident came a week after the military launched what it called ""extensive counterterrorism effort"" in the city of Jenin. Twelve Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed during the two-day operation, which involved hundreds of ground forces backed by drone strikes.

"Israel faces 'long, difficult war' after Hamas attack from Gaza",,BBC,By Paul Kirby,"Israel's military has warned that Hamas militants from Gaza are still fighting inside Israel after they infiltrated southern communities and left a reported 300 people dead.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Israelis they are going into a ""long and difficult war"".
Hundreds of gunmen burst into southern Israel, killing soldiers and civilians, and taking into Gaza what the army said was a ""significant number"" of hostages.
Israel has responded with air strikes.
These have continued on Sunday morning, with the Israeli Air Force saying it was targeting ""operational infrastructure"" in Gaza.
The Israeli military also carried out artillery strikes in southern Lebanon after mortars were fired from there towards Israeli positions in the disputed Mount Dov/Shebaa Farms area.
Lebanon's militant Hezbollah movement claimed it had carried out the attack ""in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance"".
More than 300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza since Palestinian militants infiltrated Israel from Gaza on Saturday morning, according to Palestinian health officials.
Gazans received Israeli text messages overnight telling them to leave their homes and move to city centres or take refuge in shelters.
The Israeli prime minister said in an overnight message that the war had been ""forced on us by a murderous attack by Hamas"", and the first stage would end in the coming hours when most of the militants on Israeli territory had been wiped out. Israel would restore security to its citizens and win, he added.
The Israeli government also said it would cut off electricity, fuel and goods supplies to Gaza.
Israel's nightmare scenario - armed Palestinian militants at large in the south of the country - began early on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath and festival of Simchat Torah.
Gunmen cut through the Gaza perimeter fence, storming into Israel on motorbikes, paragliders and by sea. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman said they numbered in the high hundreds, while more than 3,000 rockets were fired across Israel across the day.
""They attacked dozens of Israeli communities and IDF bases and went door to door, house to house,"" said Lt Col Jonathan Conricus.
""They executed Israeli civilians in cold blood in their homes and then continued to drag into Gaza Israeli civilians and military personnel. I'm talking women, children, elderly, disabled.""
Distressing videos emerged of Israeli civilians running for their lives from a festival in the desert, and of women being bundled into vehicles and kidnapped.
Israelis rang into news channels saying they were hiding in their homes and scared for their lives. The town of Netiv HaAsara said 15 of its residents were shot dead by Hamas militants.
In the town of Sderot, a resident called Shlomi described seeing a ""sea of bodies, inside Sderot along the road"".
Gradually the Israeli military began to reassert control over most of the southern communities. Hostages held in a dining room in Kibbutz Be'eri were eventually freed after 18 hours, Israeli media reported. Shortly afterwards further reports said troops had freed hostages in the town of Ofakim and the attackers holding them had been killed.
US President Joe Biden spoke of America's ""rock-solid and unwavering"" support for Israel which was ""under attack orchestrated by a terrorist organisation"".
Hamas's military wing said the number of Israelis captured was several times greater than dozens and they included senior military officers.
By the end of Saturday, more than 1,500 people had been wounded in Gaza and 1,500 more in Israel, officials said.
The army said Hamas's unprecedented level of violence would be met with an unprecedented response.
Tens of thousands of reservists have been mobilised and are now expected to launch a ground operation in Gaza.
On Saturday Israeli strikes destroyed the 11-storey Palestine Tower in downtown Gaza City, which houses Hamas radio stations in the rooftop.
The Israeli air force said it struck ""military infrastructure in two multi-storey buildings used by senior Hamas terrorist operatives for carrying out terrorist activity"", and that it had warned occupants to evacuate before the attack.
There was also violence in several locations in the West Bank on Saturday. Palestinian medics reported that six Palestinians were shot dead during confrontations with Israeli forces.
Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif called on Palestinians everywhere to join the group's operation.
""We have decided to put an end to these Israeli offences with God's help, so the enemy understands that the time of wreaking havoc without being held accountable is over,"" he said.
Ismail Haniyeh, the leader-in-exile of Hamas, claimed that Palestinian factions intended to expand the violence to the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.
Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas spokesman, meanwhile told the BBC that the group had direct backing for the attack from Iran.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a political rival of Hamas - said the Palestinian people had the right to defend themselves against the ""terror of settlers and occupation troops"".
There has been strong international condemnation of the Hamas attacks.
UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was ""appalled by reports that civilians have been attacked and abducted from their own homes"", while the UK's Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, said it ""unequivocally condemns the horrific attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians"".
However Saudi Arabia called for an immediate halt to the escalation, saying it had warned repeatedly about the dangers stemming from ""continued occupation"" and ""the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights"".

"Israel-Hamas war: 'Hide religion,' Welsh Jewish student told",2023-10-22,BBC,By Emilia Belli,"A Jewish university student says they have been told not to show outright signs of their religion amid the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
The 20-year-old from Cardiff University, who wishes to remain anonymous, said she felt scared about becoming a target of abuse.
Meanwhile, a Welsh-Palestinian woman said she felt ""dehumanised"" by language used.
Thousands of people have died since the start of the conflict.
Palestinian officials say more than 4,300 people have been killed in Gaza since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,400 and taking an estimated 200 hostages.
The student said a lot of people had stopped wearing their kippahs out as they did not want to become targets.
She said a friend had been ""terrified to go back to campus"" over fears of how people would react.
During a recent conference call, the Union of Jewish Students advised those who were worried about becoming targets to hide signs of their Jewish faith.
Cardiff University said there was support available and it had a zero-tolerance approach to racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.
Meanwhile, Alaa Khundakji, 36, a Welsh-Palestinian from Cardiff whose family were displaced to south Gaza due to bombing, said the atmosphere in the UK had made things worse.
""There is such great fear and anger and disappointment in the way it's portrayed, in the way as a community we're dehumanised,"" she said.
She added that Palestinian families had told her of children coming home from school ""distressed.""
She said Palestinian people in the UK were feeling ""marginalised and alienated"".
Israeli-born Moran and Tova, from Cardiff, said Israel was meant to be ""a safe haven"" for Jewish people and the community had felt let down by the Welsh government since Hamas's attack.
She said: ""We had a meeting here, we had a representative of the British government but not Wales.""
Both women said they felt unsafe and claimed a friend had been verbally abused while placing an Israeli flag on the steps of the Senedd.
They said another friend had tried to join but turned back upon seeing a pro-Palestine march in Cardiff.
Moran said: ""We are keeping a low profile at the moment.""
She said she would not allow Hamas to ""let us live in fear, they will not win and we will walk with our heads up and proud"".
Tova added: ""We don't normally want to be anonymous, we are proud Israelis, and it's painful.""
Three of Wales' police forces said they had not seen a notable increase in reported hate crime, but Supt Tim Morgan of South Wales Police said the service was ""actively reaching out"" to offer support.
The Muslim Council of Wales' secretary general Dr Abdul-Azim Ahmed said it was reassuring that Welsh police had not seen a rise in hate crime, but many Muslims were ""hurting"" and ""afraid.""
""People are concerned about the impact of campaigning for Palestine. They're concerned as well about the reception and sentiment others hold.
""It's such a polarised time, especially some of the rhetoric coming from authorities.""
The Welsh government said: ""The first minister has strongly condemned the appalling attacks carried out by Hamas and the horrific escalation in violence against Israel.""
""The minister for social justice has reached out to faith leaders in Wales to express her shock and condolences and is in touch with Faith Communities Forum to arrange a meeting with representatives from the Jewish community as soon as possible.""
When asked about Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's language around Palestinians, the UK government pointed to his statement in the Commons earlier this week when he said: ""We mourn the loss of every innocent life, of the civilians of every faith and every nationality who have been killed, so let us say it plainly: we stand with British Muslim communities, too.""
He said the UK government was providing an extra £10m of aid to Palestinians, saying Palestinian people were ""victims of Hamas too"".

Palestinian gunmen killed near West Bank Samaritan community,,BBC,By Raffi Berg,"Three Palestinians have been shot dead after opening fire on Israeli soldiers near Nablus in the occupied West Bank, Israel's military has said.
The troops were guarding the Samaritans, a tiny community which traces its origins back to biblical Israelite tribes.
Security camera footage shows a figure shooting at two soldiers who return fire before a two-minute gun battle.
It comes amid spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tensions in the West Bank.
Since the start of the year, more than 160 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
On the Israeli side, at least 30 people - including two foreigners and a Palestinian worker - have been killed in attacks or apparent attacks by Palestinians. All were civilians except one off-duty serving soldier and a member of the Israeli security forces.
In the incident on Tuesday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the soldiers were fired at from a car. It said the soldiers returned fire ""neutralising the terrorists"".
It said weapons, cartridges and military equipment were found and seized.
The official Palestinian Wafa news agency said Israeli forces took away the bodies of the men, who it said were aged between 32 and 43, and their vehicle. The militant Islamist group Hamas said the three were members of its armed wing.
The area where the incident took place is home to the Samaritans, a community believed to number fewer than 900, half of which live in Israel and the other half under Palestinian rule outside Nablus. Unusually, its members hold both Israeli and Palestinian citizenship.
They practise a religion which is rooted in Judaism, but has its own official status, customs and sets of beliefs.

Doctor in Gaza: I woke up to sounds of explosions,,BBC,By Derek Cai,"A British surgeon on a charity trip to Gaza has described how constant shelling from Israel forced him to cancel all his scheduled operations.
Abdul Qadir Hammad was there with theLiverpool International Transplant Initiative, which helps people with no access to critical medical care.
He was due to perform surgery on Saturday - the same day Hamas militants launched a deadly attack in Israel.
Israel has launched air attacks on Gaza in retaliation.
Doctor Hammad said there was no inkling of what was to come on Friday when he went to check on his patients at the Al-Shifa hospital -  the largest public healthcare complex in the Gaza Strip.
He has been visiting Gaza for decades to help patients there.
But he said things took a sharp turn on Saturday, when he ""woke up to sounds of explosions the next morning.""
""I immediately [contacted] the director of Al-Shifa hospital and asked if it was still safe to do the operations, who said yeah, I think it's okay,"" he said.
""But then within 20 minutes looking at the news, it was clear that this was not the case,"" he said, adding that they were forced to cancel all the scheduled operations.
Fearing for his safety, he made contact with the World Health Organisation and was told that it was not safe for him to remain in the hotel.
""There have been continuous airstrikes and shelling since then,"" he told the BBC's Newshour radio programme from a UN facility where he and about 20 other foreign nationals have been living since Sunday.
Shutting off electricity, food and water will be ""devastating for the civilian population and the hospitals,"" he said. ""It will cause a humanitarian disaster.""
While many human rights and aid organisations have criticised the Hamas militants' indiscriminate attack, they have also raised concerns about Israel choking vital food and energy supplies from entering Gaza.
""Kidney failure in any part of the world puts a lot of burden on the patient,"" Dr Hammad said, ""but in Gaza, in fact, it is life threatening. Kidney transplants are life-saving for these patients.""
His own safety is also a concern, he said, adding that he's thinking about his family in the UK.
A UN official told them that crossing into Israel would be difficult because of the conflict. The only safe way for them to leave Gaza is to arrange a safe passage to Egypt, but that will require complex negotiations and negotiations with the Israeli and Egyptian authorities, the official told them.
While concerned, Dr Hammad said the facility he's in is relatively safe, supplied with electricity, food, water and even the internet.
But he is worried about the people out in Gaza without access to these things, and pointed out the irony of why he went to Gaza in the first place.
""When I come here, my aim is to save three, four, maybe five lives by doing kidney transplants. But it is easy to kill 2,000 people in two days,"" he said.
""Sometimes you say what's the point of doing all this.""

Al-Shifa: What we know about Israel's raid on Gaza's main hospital,,BBC,By Sam Hancock,"The Israeli military has raided Gaza's main hospital in what it describes as a ""targeted operation against Hamas"".
An eyewitness at Al-Shifa hospital told the BBC that troops moved in overnight and were interrogating people.
On Wednesday, Israel said it found Hamas' ""operational centre"" at the hospital, sharing images of what it said were Hamas weapons and equipment.
Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side.
UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said he was ""appalled"" by the Israeli raid, while the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was ""extremely worried"" for patients and staff, with whom it had lost contact.
The BBC has been speaking to a journalist and a doctor inside the hospital to find out what is happening there, while the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has also been providing updates.
Khader, a journalist inside Al-Shifa, told the BBC's Rushdi Abualouf that Israeli troops were in ""complete control"" of the hospital and no shooting was taking place.
He said six tanks and about 100 commandos entered the complex during the night. The Israeli forces then went room to room, questioning staff and patients.
The IDF reportedly asked all men aged 16-40 to leave the hospital buildings, except the surgical and emergency departments, and go to the hospital courtyard.
Soldiers fired into the air to force those remaining inside to come out, Khader said.
However Muhammad Zaqout, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry's director of hospitals, told Al Jazeera that ""not a single bullet"" had been fired - because ""there are no resistors or detainees"" inside.
Early on Wednesday, the IDF said its forces were in the midst of a ""precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area"" in the hospital.
It said the raid was ""based on intelligence information and an operational necessity"", calling for the surrender of ""all Hamas terrorists"" present there.
As the soldiers entered the hospital complex, they engaged with a number Hamas members and killed them, the IDF said.
On Wednesday evening, the IDF said troops found ""an operational command centre, weapons, and technological assets"" belonging to Hamas inside the MRI building.
It said it was ""continuing to operate in the hospital complex"", sharing images and videos showing what it said were Hamas weapons.
In a seven-minute video, IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus pointed to security cameras that he said had been covered over, and weapons that he said were AK47 rifles hidden behind MRI scanners.
The BBC has not yet been able to verify the video or its location.
But unless Israel has more to reveal, the military's controversial operation inside the hospital did not net a major arsenal of weapons, reports the BBC's Orla Guerin in Jerusalem.
Hamas knew Israel was coming, and therefore, if they were operating beneath the hospital, they would have had weeks to clear out through Gaza's extensive tunnel network, our correspondent adds.
Israel's Army Radio reported that troops had not yet found any sign of any of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attack on Israel, when 1,200 other people were killed.
The raid on Al-Shifa came shortly after the US publicly backed Israeli claims that Hamas had infrastructure underneath the hospital.
However Dr Ahmed Mokhallalati, a plastic surgeon at Al-Shifa, told the BBC there were only civilians in the hospital.
He said there were tunnels under every building in Gaza, including Al-Shifa hospital.
According to international humanitarian law, hospitals are specially protected facilities.
This means that parties to conflicts cannot attack hospitals, or prevent them performing their medical functions. They can lose their protection if they are used by a party to the conflict to commit an ""act harmful to the enemy"".
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says this could be something like ahospital being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a shelter for able-bodied fighters, or to shield a military objective from attack.
The IDF said it had repeatedly warned Hamas its ""continued military use of Al-Shifa jeopardises its protected status"", calling for the evacuation of the hospital before the raid.
The WHO had warned that evacuating patients would be a ""death sentence"", given that the medical system was collapsing.
Dr Mokhallalati told the BBC on Wednesday the hospital was without power, oxygen and water. On Tuesday, surgeries had been carried out without proper anaesthesia, with patients ""screaming in pain"". Doctors were unable to help one patient with burns, and had to just ""let him die"".
Dr Mokhallalati said  six premature babies had died in recent days.
""Why can't they be evacuated,"" he said. ""In Afghanistan, they evacuated the cats and dogs.""
The IDF said it was providing incubators, baby food and medical supplies.

Israel and Palestinians: Factory attack political protesters jailed,2023-06-26,BBC,,"Pro-Palestinian protesters who caused hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage to an electronics plant they believed was making circuit boards for Israeli drones have been jailed.
Teledyne Labtech, in Presteigne, Powys was targeted in December 2022.
Activists in red suits and balaclavas smashed windows, daubed red paint on walls and drilled holes in the roof.
They also used crowbars to destroy office equipment and they also covered a memorial to a staff member in paint.
Susan Bagshaw, 55, of Comins Coch, Ceredigion, Morwenna Grey, 42, of Machynlleth, Powys, Tristan Dixon, 34, of Huddersfield, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit criminal damage.
Ruth Hogg, 40, of Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, was found guilty of the same charge after a trial in Caernarfon in May.
Hogg was jailed for 27 months, while the other three were sentenced to 23 months each at Mold Crown Court on Monday.
Judge Rhys Rowlands told the court the group caused ""wanton damage"" at the factory.
It heard workers were in the canteen on the morning of 9 December when they heard breaking glass, as Bagshaw and Grey broke windows to get in.
Once inside, the two women, wearing boiler suits and balaclavas, smashed computer screens, sprayed paint on the walls and floors, and set off smoke bombs.
Hogg and Dixon were then found drilling and sawing on the roof and smashing skylights.
A banner in support of Palestine was unfurled across the side of the factory.
Elen Owen, prosecuting, told the court there was evidence of planning and premeditation by the group.
She said they caused fear and distress to staff adding that one said he feared for his life.
The combined cost of the damage and consequential costs such as security measures, totalled about £1.2m she said.
The factory, which employed 64 people at the time, was closed for about three weeks for the clean-up and repairs.
In a victim impact statement, the firm's general manager, Adele MacLachlan, said there was anger about ""misinformation"" surrounding what Teledyne Labtech manufactured.
It made, she said, circuit boards for applications, like inflight entertainment antennae, MRI scanners and radar.
Judge Rowlands said though they believed the company was involved in the manufacture of arms used by Israel against Palestinians, there were no security fences or guards at the factory, which made it ""a very unlikely candidate for ties with arms industry"".
He said the group carried out ""a sea of vandalism"" and a ""significant"" degree of costly damage.
He also said: ""There was a high degree of planning and premeditation and intention to cause a high degree of damage.""
There were a number of aggravating features to the case, he said, including that it was a group action which posed a risk to others, and workers and the emergency services were inconvenienced.
He accepted all four had shown a degree of remorse for their actions and had said in letters to the court that they would not carry out such action again.
But he said contrition in Hogg's case was ""hollow"" given that she pleaded not guilty.
He said the action they took was ""very far from the generality of direct action cases… it involved extreme behaviour and violence.""
""Your intention was to put the factory out of action for as long as you could.""

"Israeli soldier killed, Palestinian teen attack suspect shot dead amid violent surge",2023-08-31,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"An Israeli soldier has been killed and several other people wounded in a suspected lorry ramming attack by a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank.
It comes at a tense time where deadly violence there has surged to a level not seen for some two decades.
Overnight, Palestinian militants set off an improvised explosive device near a convoy of Israeli troops in Nablus.
In Jerusalem, a 14-year-old Palestinian boy was shot dead by an Israeli police officer after allegedly stabbing a man.
According to an Israeli military official, the suspected ramming attack was carried out by a Palestinian man, who was 41 and had a permit to work in Israel.  He was driving eastwards in a lorry towards the Maccabim crossing when he made a sudden U-turn.
He drove into a group of off-duty soldiers who were standing by the side of the road, dressed in uniform.
One soldier was killed.  Three soldiers, two people in a passing car and a Palestinian worker were injured.
The driver of the lorry - which was not registered to him - then made off and was shot dead by Israeli security guards at another checkpoint some 6km (four miles) away.  Pictures of the white pick-up truck show the windscreen riddled with bullet holes.
The checkpoint where the soldiers were allegedly targeted is on a busy main road which leads from central Israel, through the West Bank, to Jerusalem.
Overnight, violence erupted in Nablus, in the northern West Bank, as Israeli soldiers attempted to secure a route for Jewish visitors to a sensitive holy site known as Joseph's Tomb.
The location, close to Balata Refugee Camp, has been a frequent flashpoint since Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
Four soldiers were injured when an explosive device was detonated next to them, the Israeli military said.  Video shared on social media showed a large plume of white smoke rising into the air after the blast.
Some 30 Palestinians in Nablus were also injured during confrontations with the Israeli army, according to local medics.
On Wednesday evening, a teenager from occupied East Jerusalem was shot and killed by an off-duty Israeli policeman at a light railway station, not far from the Old City.  The stop is on the invisible line that divides East and West Jerusalem.
Israeli witnesses said that the boy stabbed a man in the back with a kitchen knife and that other civilians tried to disarm him and scuffled with him.  Israeli police say that he was then shot by an officer who was on board the train.
Some Palestinian reports have given a differing sequence of events.
Earlier in the day, a Palestinian man had been shot and seriously wounded by Israeli troops after allegedly ramming them with his car and injuring one soldier, near the southern West Bank city of Hebron.
In the past year and a half, there has been a rise in Palestinian shooting and vehicle ramming attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers.  There have also been an increased number of Israeli military raids and mass arrests in the West Bank and an upturn in violence against Palestinians by extremist settlers.
In 2023 so far, more than 180 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to figures collated from PA sources. Israel says most of those killed were militants, but stone-throwing youths protesting against incursions and civilians not involved in any confrontations have also been killed.
Some 33 people - the vast majority of them civilians - have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis during the same period.

West Bank: Eight Palestinians killed during Israeli raid,2023-11-26,BBC,By Sebastian Usher,"Eight Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The most serious incident was an Israeli raid overnight in the city of Jenin, in which five were killed.
The Israeli army said it was mounting a raid to capture a Palestinian who was suspected of involvement in an ambush that killed two Israelis in August.
Palestinian factions have called for a strike in Jenin to mourn those killed.
The West Bank has seen almost daily clashes for more than a year and a half, after Israel suffered a wave of deadly violence by Palestinian militants.
Israeli forces have gone into West Bank towns and cities in search of those suspected of being involved in shootings and stabbings or planning such attacks.
Jenin has been a flashpoint, and hundreds of Palestinians - both fighters and civilians - have been killed.
Back in July, Israeli forces launched an incursion into the city's refugee camp, which is regarded as a hotbed of militants.
Thirteen Palestinians were killed in the fiercest confrontation in the West Bank for 20 years.
In addition, Israeli settlers have responded to killings carried out by Palestinian gunmen with rampages in Palestinian towns and villages.
So, the area was already at boiling point before the Hamas assault on Israel on 7 October.
In the weeks since then, the UN says some 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or settlers in a new escalation of the conflict. Four Israelis have been killed by Palestinians.
Even as Israel has been fighting a war with Hamas in Gaza, it has tightened its controls on the West Bank in a bid to prevent a spill-over of the conflict.
But this appears only to have further undermined the Palestinian Authority and boosted the rise of militant groups in Jenin and beyond.

Dozens killed as Israeli strikes hit southern Gaza refuge areas,2023-10-17,BBC,By David Gritten,"More than 100 Palestinians have been killed in air strikes in southern Gaza, officials say, as the Israeli military continues to target the area despite ordering civilians to shelter there.
Most of the dead reportedly fled their homes in the north ahead of what is expected to be a major ground offensive against the militant group Hamas.
The military said it struck a series of Hamas targets in the south.
There is also mounting concern about humanitarian conditions in Gaza.
The US said it had agreed to develop a plan with Israel that would enable aid to reach civilians in the Hamas-governed territory, as UN aid agencies warned that hospitals' fuel supplies were unlikely to last more than 24 hours, water was extremely limited and shops only had a few days of food left.
There have been hopes of opening Egypt's Rafah crossing to let lorryloads of urgently needed aid in and Palestinians with foreign passports out.But an Israeli strike reportedly damaged a building at the crossing on Monday.
Israel cut electricity and most water and stopped deliveries of food and medicine through its crossings in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas militants on 7 October in which at least 1,300 people were killed and 199 others taken hostage.
Around 3,000 people have been killed in Israel's bombardment of Gaza since then, according to health officials.
The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf in Khan Younis says that what happened overnight in southern Gaza is very worrying for the hundreds of thousands of people who have complied with last Friday's order from the Israeli military to evacuate northern Gaza for their ""own safety"".
Local officials in Khan Younis said three Israeli air strikes left more than 100 people dead, most of whom were displaced.
Amin Hneideq said his daughter was wounded by a bomb that destroyed a nearby home and killed a family who had fled southwards. ""They brought them from the north just to strike them in the south,"" he told Reuters news agency.
The Israeli military said on Tuesday morning that it had struck operational command centres, military infrastructure with operatives inside, and hideouts belonging to Hamas in Khan Younis and Rafah, to the south, as well as two northern areas.
Later, it announced that a strike had killed a top Hamas military commander, Ayman Nofal, who it described as ""one of the most dominant figures in the terrorist organisation"". Hamas said he died in a strike in Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.
Many displaced people in Khan Younis told the BBC that they were planning to pack up their belongings and return to their homes.
One man said he had been sleeping in the street for the last couple of days, and that he would prefer to die in dignity than to die from thirst.
Khan Younis, Rafah and other southern communities have been overwhelmed by the need to accommodate and feed more than 600,000 displaced people. Another 400,000 people have sought shelter elsewhere in the Strip.
""Every day it's a daily mission for everyone to go to find things to feed their children,"" filmmaker Yousef Hammash told BBC Radio 5 Live, adding that everyone was suffering extreme stress and were existing in ""survival mode"".
Some water was brought to Khan Younis from a store in Gaza City on Tuesday, which was risky because there was no guarantee the lorries would not be targeted by Israeli forces.
The UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said Israel opened one line of water to southern Gaza for three hours on Monday, but thatonly 14% of the Strip's 2.2 million population were able to benefit.
Gaza's last functioning seawater desalination plant was also forced to shut down due to a lack of fuel, increasing concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases.
The hospital in Khan Younis, which has been struggling to treat some of the 12,500 people so far wounded in air strikes, said it would run out of fuel for its back-up generators at midnight, placing the lives of patients at serious risk.
People have been trying to secure additional fuel at local petrol stations and companies, which would allow the hospital to keep functioning.
The World Food Programme also said that food shops in Gaza had just four or five days of supplies left. It added that there might be a few days' more in warehouses, but the Israeli strikes were making access very difficult.
Despite such warnings, an Israeli military spokesman insisted that ""there is no humanitarian crisis right now in Gaza"".
""We do not have the commitment to supply Hamas electricity,"" Lt Col Richard Hecht told BBC Newsnight.
""People who attacked us, they've been in control for multiple years already in the Gaza Strip. They have electricity... I also see water in the south of Gaza.""
The UN human rights office meanwhile said Israel's order for 1.1 million civilians to evacuate, combined with the imposition of its ""complete siege"" on Gaza, could constitute the ""forcible transfer of civilians in violation of international law"".
A spokeswoman also said reports of attacks on civilians attempting to flee had to be investigated independently and warned that ""we cannot have collective punishment of an entire population because of an attack by militants.""
She appealed again for Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups to immediately and unconditionally release all of the hostages being held in Gaza and to stop firing indiscriminate rockets at Israeli cities and towns.
Overnight, Hamas released a video of a 21-year-old Israeli-French woman, Mia Shem, who said she was captured at a music festival where at least 260 other partygoers were massacred.
On Tuesday,her mother Keren told a news conference: ""I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home. She only went to a party to have some fun. And now she's in Gaza and she's not the only one.
""There are babies and children and old people, Holocaust survivors, who were kidnapped... This is a crime against humanity.""
In a separate development, the Israeli military said it had carried out new strikes on targets belonging to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in response to cross-border anti-tank missile fire.
Troops also killed four militants who attempted to infiltrate Israeli territory and plant an explosive device, it added.
The Israeli military and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire almost daily since Hamas's attack, raising fears of a regional war.

Conservative MPs express concern over Israel boycott bill,2023-10-25,BBC,,"Tory MPs have criticised a government bill which would ban public bodies from boycotting Israel as a ""violation of freedom of speech"" and ""draconian"".
Ex-minister Kit Malthouse said it risked ""playing into the antisemitism"" that has increased in the UK recently.
The bill imposes a ban on public bodies making their own direct or indirect boycotts, disinvestment or sanctions campaigns against other countries.
Communities Secretary Michael Gove said it would help to fight antisemitism.
The government says the bill would guarantee foreign policy remained a UK government matter.
The Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill, known as the anti-BDS bill, seeks to prevent public bodies, including councils, from campaigning against, boycotting or sanctioning a particular international territory - unless that is endorsed by the UK government's own foreign policy.
It aims to limit the reach of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for broad-based economic and cultural boycotts of Israel and Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
The BDS movement is widely backed by Palestinians and anti-occupation groups in the UK. Israel sees it as antisemitic - as dothe United StatesandGermany- and has supported moves by other governments to outlaw such boycotts by public bodies. The issue is highly controversial, often sparking rows and protest among rival groups supportive of Israel or the Palestinians.
The BDS says it opposes racism including Islamophobia and antisemitism.
During a debate on the bill in Parliament a number of MPs including some Conservatives and a senior Labour MP strongly criticised the legislation.
Former Home Office minister Mr Malthouse argued against a section of the legislation which would forbid public authorities to say they would back a boycott if it was lawful.
""To not even be able to express opposition to the law whilst still complying with it seems to be very un-British, extremely illiberal and unnecessarily draconian,"" he said.
Another former Conservative minister, George Eustice, said it was a ""violation of freedom of speech"".
The bill gives the government the power to make certain countries exempt from the boycott restrictions.
However, it does not allow the exemption of Israel, the Occupied Territories or the Occupied Golan Heights, specifically naming these areas in the legislation.
Mr Malthouse told MPs: ""In carving out Israel, the West Bank and the occupied Golan Heights in the legislation, the secretary of state is, I'm afraid, playing into the antisemitism that we've seen rise in this country over the last few weeks.""
Senior Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge also expressed a fear that the bill would strengthen polarisation at a time when the Israel-Gaza war had already heightened community tensions.
She told MPs: ""To bring this wrong-headed, poorly-drafted politically-motivated bill back in the midst of these horrors we are seeing every day… is an act of complete irresponsibility and unbelievable foolishness.""
Mr Gove robustly defended his bill, insisting it would not undermine free speech or prevent local authorities from taking into account human rights considerations when making decisions.
He told MPs that the bill had the backing of the representative bodies that speak for Britain's Jewish community.
He said: ""When they are so clear that this legislation is in the interests of community cohesion, fighting antisemitism, and making the United Kingdom a safe house for everyone, when they are so clear, we should treat their words with respect.""
The bill was also backed by Conservative MP Theresa Villiers who said local authorities should be focused on ""delivering services not conducting their own foreign policy"".
Another Tory, Andrew Percy, disagreed with MPs who said the bill should not be brought forward while tensions were running high. ""Are we waiting until Hamas give us permission,"" he asked.
Amendments from Labour, Conservative and SNP MPs were defeated and the bill continues its progress through Parliament.

Israel Gaza conflict: Scottish footballer Clark Robertson tells of escape,2023-10-11,BBC,By Phil McDonald & Ken Banks,"A Scottish footballer who plays for a team in Israel has told how he had to flee the country when it came under attack from Hamas.
Clark Robertson, a former Aberdeen player, recently signed for MS Ashdod.
He is now home in Aberdeen after club officials told him to leave the country in the wake of the weekend attacks.
Since then the death toll in Israel has reached 1,200, with more than 1,000 people killed by Israeli air strikes on Gaza.
Seventeen British nationals, including children, aredead or missing follow the attack on Israel.
Among them isBernard Cowan, who grew up in Glasgowbefore settling in Israel with his wife and three children.
Mr Robertson, 30, slept on the floor of Tel Aviv airport on Saturday night before being able to secure a flight to safety.
He told BBC Scotland News: ""It was a big shock for everyone, a very worrying time.""
On Friday evening the team stayed in the north of Israel ahead of a game on Saturday evening.
""I got woken up by my teammate at 8am to say that the game was off, he said Israel was under attack,"" Mr Robertson explained.
""At that time I don't think anyone realised how serious it was because they're used to rockets.
""Once we found out on Saturday morning it was all kicking off, we got back on the bus to Ashdod which is about 20 minutes from Gaza, which probably wasn't the safest thing to do but I think the club acted professionally and quickly.""
He said the club told all its foreign players to get their passports, pack their suitcases and get to the airport as soon as possible.
After spending the night at the airport, he flew to Budapest on Sunday evening and came back to Aberdeen on Monday.
The footballer said: ""A couple of rockets hit Ashdod yesterday actually. We've got a group chat with all the players, I think they're all OK, they are all safe.
""Nobody knows what's going to happen in the coming days, weeks and months really. I don't know when I'm going to be going back out there.""
The former Blackpool, Rotherham United and Portsmouth player added: ""I think I'm the first Scotsman to go over and play there, that was a very proud moment for me. In the last three months I've loved living in Israel, it's an amazing place.
""When my agent told me about the interest from Ashdod, and a couple of other Israeli clubs, I started doing my research obviously. My mum was probably a bit more worried than me.
""Nobody saw this attack coming. Hopefully I can get back and do what I love doing, when it's safe to do so.
""Hopefully there can be some sort of resolution soon, some sort of normality.""

Backlash over bill banning boycotts of Israel goods from public bodies,2023-07-03,BBC,"By Ione Wells, Political correspondent, & Paul Seddon","The government has been urged to rethink its plans to fine public bodies which initiate boycotts against Israel.
The proposals received initial backing but have been met with criticism from both Conservative and Labour MPs.
Communities Secretary Michael Gove said the bill would guarantee foreign policy remained a UK government matter.
But Labour says the bill undermines the UK's longstanding foreign policy towards the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
The party warned the bill also risked undermining support for people around the world facing persecution, as well as placing ""unprecedented restrictions"" on elected councils, undermining freedom of speech and having potential ""widespread and negative impacts"" on local authority pension funds.
The Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill seeks to prevent public bodies, including councils, from campaigning against, boycotting or sanctioning a particular international territory - unless that is endorsed by the UK government's own foreign policy.
First published last month, it received initial backing by 268 to 70 votes after several hours of debate in the House of Commons on Monday.
Much of the debate on the issue has focused on boycotts of Israel and Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement calls for broad-based economic and cultural boycotts of Israel and Israel settlements - similar to those applied to South Africa in the apartheid era.
Such boycotts are backed by Palestinians who see them as applying pressure on Israel to end its military occupation.
The Israeli government, on the other hand, sees the entire BDS movement as unjustly singling out Israel and describes it as antisemitic.
Speaking in the Commons, Mr Gove said there had been an ""increase in antisemitic events following on from the activities of the BDS movement"".
He added that although there were ""legitimate reasons to criticise the Israeli government"", the BDS movement was asking councils to ""treat Israel differently from any other nation on the globe"".
""Nothing in this bill prevents or impedes the loudest of criticisms of Israel's government and leaders,"" he added.
But Labour - and a number of Conservative MPs - raised concerns about the bill's potential impact on UK foreign policy.
Dame Margaret Hodge, who served in Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said the proposed legislation was ""flawed, poorly drafted and will have damaging consequences both here and abroad"".
""The bill is not a considered attempt to bring about peace, provide better security for Israel or respond to the threats posed by BDS,"" she said.
""It's about using Jews as a pawn in the government's political game.""
Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the government must remove references to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories from the bill.
She said the bill ""essentially gives exceptional impunity to Israel"", adding: ""This is something we should not give to any country and I would be standing here making the same request if any country was named.""
Longstanding UK government policy calls for an end to Israel's military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories as part of a negotiated ""two-state solution"".
The UK has for decades endorsed the position of international law, under which Israeli settlements are seen as illegal - although Israel disputes this - and sees their expansion as an ""obstacle to peace"".
The bill does not stop public bodies from complying with UK-wide sanctions, and it gives the government the power to make certain countries exempt from the restrictions.
For example, the government intends Russia and Belarus to be exempted.
But the bill does not allow the rules to exempt Israel, the Occupied Territories or the Occupied Golan Heights.
In doing so, it groups the three territories together, which critics including Labour argue undermines the UK's foreign policy position by suggesting boycotting Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories or Golan Heights would be the same as boycotting Israel - despite the illegality of the former two under international law.
Critics have also raised concerns that the bill would limit campaigns against human rights abuses in other parts of the world - such as against the Uyghur in Xinjiang, China.
Ahead of the vote on Monday, the government spokesperson said: ""Public bodies should not be pursuing their own foreign policy agenda.
""The bill will not hinder the robust action we are taking against Uyghur forced labour in supply chains as it contains exceptions to the ban for labour related misconduct, including modern slavery.
""The ban on boycotts does not apply to individuals, including publicly elected officials, when carrying out private acts that are protected by the Human Rights Act.""
A Labour amendment to the bill was defeated in the Commons by 272 votes to 212 - a margin of 60.
The amendment had sought to decline the bill a second reading over concerns it ""risks significantly undermining support"" for groups around the world facing persecution, for example the Uyghur, who are ""currently victims of grave and systemic human rights abuses"".
It said it opposed any ""discrimination"" by public bodies in how they spend their money and says all public bodies must act ""without bias"" when making decisions on procurement and investment.

'They were going tree by tree and shooting' - Israeli partygoer describes festival attack,2023-10-08,BBC,,"Gili Yoskovich was among hundreds of young people at a dance music festival in southern Israel, near the Gaza Strip, when gunmen opened fire in the early hours of Saturday morning, as Palestinian militants launched a co-ordinated attack on Israel.
She described to the BBC how she hid under a tree in a field as gunmen roamed about shooting anybody they found.
""They were...all over the place with automatic weapons.
""They were standing next to the cars starting to shoot but I realised it was very easy to get killed...because everyone was going everywhere.
""The terrorists were coming from four or five places...so we didn't know whether to go here, so then I got into my car again and I drove a little bit more.
""Some people were shooting at me. I left the car and started to run, I saw a place with many pomelo trees and I went there.
""So I was in the middle [of this field] and I was lying on the floor. It was the second hiding place I found and they were just all around me.
""They were going tree by tree and shooting. Everywhere. From two sides. I saw people were dying all around. I was very quiet. I didn't cry, I didn't do anything.
""But I was on the one hand breathing, saying: 'OK, I'm going to die.  It's OK, just breathe, just close your eyes,' because it was shooting everywhere, it was very very close to me.
""Then I heard the terrorists open a big van...and get more weapons from this car. They were in the area for three hours. No-one was there, no-one.
""I was sure the army would come, I heard some helicopters, I was sure the army would come down with helicopters and ropes and go down into this field and save us. But no-one was there. Just all these terrorists.
""They were very close to me and my leg was shaking. I tried and did my best, I moved a little bit and when they were in this side I heard them talking Arabic.
""I tried to be more under the tree so maybe when the shooting comes, they will not touch my face. ""I was lying there for three hours.
""I was just thinking about my kids, my friend, about everything and I was saying it's not the time to die for me, not yet. Then I started to hear some Hebrew from one side, [but] Arabic from three sides. I realised that there were some soldiers, maybe five or six.
""I decided to go to these soldiers. Meanwhile there were still terrorists around, so I was going with my hands up so that they will know that its me and I'm not a terrorist. Then someone was putting me in a car.
""I was the first one to get out of the field. It took others two or three more hours to get out [and] all the way people were dying - all the way on the road, young people, [as] it's a festival for young people.
Many many people were dying on the road.
Whoever tried to run away they were shooting from both sides. So best was to hide.  ""The most crazy thing is how come we were there for such a long time and no one was there. No army, no police. Nothing.""

Israel angrily dismisses UN truce resolution on Gaza,2023-10-27,BBC,By George Wright & Antoinette Radford,"Israel has angrily dismissed a UN resolution urging a ""humanitarian truce"" in Gaza, vowing that it will continue to defend itself.
The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly called for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas.
Israeli UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan said the UN no longer held ""even one ounce of legitimacy or relevance"".
The US voted against the resolution but has called for a ""humanitarian pause"" in Israeli military operations in Gaza.
Israel's military on Friday said it was expanding its operations, as its strikes intensified across the Gaza region.
Spokesman Daniel Hagari said forces had ""increased the attacks in Gaza. The air force widely attacks underground targets and terrorist infrastructure, very significantly"".
He again told Gaza residents to move further south.
Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.
The UN General Assembly on Friday voted in favour of an immediate truce in Gaza. There were 120 votes in favour, 14 against and 45 abstentions.
The resolution - put forward by Jordan on behalf of the Arab group - also condemns all acts of violence against Palestinian and Israeli civilians, including all ""terror and indiscriminate attacks"".
The vote is not legally binding, but carries moral weight due to the universality of the UN's membership.
Israel's Ambassador Erdan called it ""a dark day for the UN and for mankind,"" vowing his country would use ""every means"" in fighting Hamas.
""Today is a day that will go down as infamy. We have all witnessed that the UN no longer holds even one ounce of legitimacy or relevance,"" he said.
He accused those who voted yes of preferring to support ""the defence of Nazi terrorists"" instead of Israel.
US national security spokesperson John Kirby said the US would support breaks in fighting to help hostages get out of Gaza - and to allow more aid in.
""We would support humanitarian pauses for stuff getting in, as well as for people getting out, and that includes pushing for fuel to get in and for the restoration of electrical power,"" he said.
The White House has not commented on the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) announcement that Israel is expanding its ground operations into Gaza.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 7,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began. There is now a critical shortage of essential services, thousands have fled their homes and the infrastructure has been heavily damaged.
Among international leaders calling for a ceasefire was France's President Emmanuel Macron.
Speaking before Israel said it was increasing its attacks in Gaza, he said he had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog that the population of Gaza must be protected.
""A humanitarian truce is useful today to be able to protect those who are on the ground, who have suffered bombings,"" he said at the end of a two-day summit of EU leaders in Brussels.
Mr Macron reiterated that Israel had a right to defend itself, but he said ""the complete blockade, the indiscriminate bombardment and even more the prospect of a massive ground operation"" posed significant risks for the civilian population in Gaza.
Meanwhile, Jordan warned the outcome of what it called a ""ground war"" would be a humanitarian catastrophe.
Israel this week called for the UN's secretary general tostep down over comments he made about the Gaza war.
António Guterres said in a speech to the Security Council on Tuesday that he condemned unequivocally Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel two weeks ago but that they ""did not happen in a vacuum"".
Israel accused him of ""justifying terrorism"" and called for his immediate resignation.

Jenin: Abbas bids to reassert control with rare visit after Israeli assault,2023-07-12,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has paid his first visit in over a decade to Jenin in the occupied West Bank.
It comes a week after a massive Israeli military assault on the city's refugee camp.
The visit was a bid to reassert control by the Palestinian Authority (PA) leader amid the worst security and political crisis in the territory in two decades.
He pledged to rebuild the camp, which he called ""an icon of struggle"".
At the camp gates, where flags of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad flew next to those of the internationally recognised PA, Mr Abbas arrived amid chaotic scenes.
He had flown to Jenin in a Jordanian military helicopter from his headquarters, 100km (62 miles) to the south in the city of Ramallah.
There was a huge armed deployment. PA security forces joined a thousand-strong unit of Mr Abbas' elite presidential guard to clear a path for the 87-year-old to enter the camp, parts of which remain devastated from Israel's air and ground assault.
Using a stuttering microphone that repeatedly stopped working and made it hard for the crowd to hear, the Palestinian president spoke of defiance, calling Jenin camp ""heroic"" and saying that it ""stood against the aggression and sacrificed its people for the homeland"".
He also appealed for unity. ""We came to say we are one authority, one state, one law, one security and one stability"".
But, in a further sign of the collapse in public support for the PA, there were only a few hundred people in the crowd from among the urban refugee camp's 24,000 residents.
The PA was created during the Oslo peace accords of the 1990s, giving Palestinians limited self-governance ahead of a hoped-for transition to an independent state.
Now, many Palestinians view it as a security sub-contractor for Israel's military occupation of the West Bank, which is into its 57th year. Polls suggest most Palestinians now back armed resistance, believing the PA fails to protect them.
In the crowd for the speech by Mr Abbas - also known by his nickname Abu Mazen - was Jenin resident Mohammed al-Ghoul. He appealed for unity among all the Palestinian factions but complained that the PA forces stand aside when Israeli forces enter.
""Abu Mazen has brought the [Palestinian] military with him - there are snipers and troops,"" he said.
""If they were here like this when the occupation [Israeli] army raids, then [the Israelis] wouldn't dare to enter.""
As Israel's military raids have intensified in the West Bank, Mr Abbas has vowed to end security co-ordination with Israel - a pledge he has made many times before but which is rarely acted on.
Further inside the camp, militant gunmen still patrolled as Mr Abbas spoke and his forces did not venture further.
Palestinian sources told the BBC that the militant groups co-ordinated the president's visit with PA security forces. They said the militants on Tuesday allowed the PA forces to defuse improved explosive devices (IEDS) under streets, which had previously been laid to try to repel Israeli military raids.
The recent use of such IEDS against Israeli troops had been a key factor leading up to last week's Israeli operation.
In exchange for the co-ordination, the PA released around a dozen Palestinian militants from its prisons, according to the sources.
Mr Abbas also paid a short visit to lay a wreath at the nearby cemetery where nine of the 12 Palestinians killed last week are buried. Ten of the dead have been claimed by militant groups as members. One Israeli soldier was also killed.
The camp is largely in the control of militants calling themselves the Jenin Brigade. It is a loose alliance of armed organisations including the more established groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. They are all listed by Israel and the West as terrorist organisations.
The past year has seen rising numbers of Palestinian armed attacks targeting Israelis, while Israel has intensified its deadly military raids in the West Bank. At least 160 Palestinians and more than 30 Israelis have been killed since January.
Israel's government said its two-day military operation last week was to stop Jenin camp being a ""refuge for terrorism"". It said it seized hundreds of guns and other weapons, including ""advanced"" improvised explosives.
It was Israel's biggest assault in the West Bank in two decades, involving drone strikes and armoured diggers causing massive destruction.
The United Nations accused Israel of using excessive force, while the Palestinian leadership called it a ""war crime"".

Gaza: BBC reporter and family left homeless again after Israel air strike warning,2023-10-17,BBC,"By Rushdi Abu Alouf in Khan Younis, Gaza","It was just before 3pm in Gaza on Tuesday. I was preparing to go live on BBC TV News when I received a call from my wife - almost in tears, the kids crying in the background.
They'd been told to leave the apartment we'd been staying in because of a warning the Israeli air force was going to bomb next door.
I told her to grab the children and leave immediately. My colleague Mahmoud was nearby and I rang him to ask him to help.
For the second time in five days, my family was fleeing - running from the bombing.
On Friday, we had packed up our house in Gaza City, after the Israelis told everybody in northern Gaza to move south for their own safety.
We moved with my father-in-law and my wife's sister and their families. Like thousands of other families, we drove to the city of Khan Younis. We spent hours and hours looking for anywhere we could stay.
It wasn't easy. An already crowded city of 400,000 people was swelling to take in more than a million.
Finally, we found a house where the owners agreed to let us share with another family.  We thought the neighbourhood Al Amal looked busy, had a bakery and a pharmacy and that we would be safe because it had so many people in it.
Together with the other families in the building, we helped each other find water and food.
But then the owner of the building said he had received a phone call. The caller identified themselves as an Israeli soldier, checked the owner's name and said the building should be evacuated because the building next door (only a metre away) was going to be destroyed.
We all left straight away and got to a safe distance leaving many of our possessions. It was impossible to know when Israel would bomb, in five minutes or the next day.
I told the family to go to the Red Cross (ICRC) hospital, about 700 metres away, just to be sure.
So now we are homeless again. I've knocked on the door of a house near the hospital and have asked the family inside to look after my wife and children for a few hours, so I can work out what to do next.
Honestly, I don't know what to do - it is hard to be a reporter and try to look after my family like this. I struggle to find food and water for them. We now don't have a home.
I've covered the previous wars in Gaza but this is the first time my family has been so affected.
I can cope when I'm in danger but when your family is too, you feel guilty.

Gaza: Surgeon ready to help says moral duty trumps fear,2023-11-13,BBC,By Tim Dodd,"With each passing day, groups of volunteer medics in different parts of the world remain on standby to go to Gaza to care for the thousands of injured and sick people who fill hospitals stretched to the extreme. Professor Nick Maynard is one of them.
Nick is a consultant surgeon, based in Oxford, who's been travelling to the Gaza Strip and West Bank for more than a decade.
Since 2010 he has been to Gaza almost every year, usually leading a group of medics who teach students and junior doctors.
In May, he witnessed the conflict first-hand whenat least 15 Palestinians, including three commanders of the militant group Islamic Jihad, were killedin Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip.
Gaza locked down, and after four days of ""non-stop"" bombing Nick was evacuated by the UN.
He is now on standby to go and work in operating theatres with the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, as soon as it becomes safe to do so amidthe conflict between Israel and Hamas.
""A huge sense of duty"" is motivating him to want to go and do what he can, and he says he is not alone.
""I think there is fear, apprehension, not knowing what one would find, but I think the other motives for doing so… are so powerful that they outweigh everything else,"" he says.
""I consider it a huge privilege to be in a position to help these people who need help more than most of us can possibly understand.
""It just feels the right thing to do...I've got many friends over there who I'm very close to. I've got Gazan friends staying with us [now].""
He shares the story of Enas, a young Gazan doctor he trained who he and his wife have become an ""adoptive parent"" to.
She left Gaza eight years ago after securing a scholarship to study in England but has never been able to return.
As part of Israel's blockade of Gaza, Palestinians are prohibited from entering and leaving except in extremely rare cases, including if people need care for life-threatening conditions or if they are on a limited list of merchants.
When Enas got married, Nick walked her down the aisle because her family were denied permission to leave Gaza.
She has had little contact with them in recent weeks due tocommunications blackouts, and goes days without knowing if they are alive or dead.
""They think they'll die,"" Nick says. ""They've all written their names in indelible ink on their arms and their legs so that if they get killed, they'll be identified.""
The Islamic University of Gaza and Al-Azhar University, where Nick teaches, both sustained ""serious damage"" in October during bombing, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, which forms part of the Palestinian Authority.
The Israel Defense Forces claimed the Islamic University of Gaza ""serves as a central training centre for Hamas engineers"" and a ""training institution for the development and production of weapons"", claims Nick is sceptical of.
""I've visited these buildings on many, many occasions and, more importantly, people I've known for many years and trust implicitly have spent decades in these buildings and [they] do not believe that happens,"" he says.
""It's inconceivable to me that they could be used as Hamas headquarters without the knowledge of people who work there day in, day out.""
Countries including Turkey, Jordan, and Egypt have been calling for a ceasefire, as well as theUnited Nations and the leaders of all of its major agencies.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there would be no ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages, but that humanitarian pauses might be possible to let aid into the enclave and hostages out.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also resisted callsfor one, saying it would allow Hamas to ""regroup and repeat"" its 7 October attacks, in which it killed 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped more than 200 others.
Nick insists that in order for Gazan patients to be helped there needs to be a complete ceasefire, ""not a temporary pause of 48 hours"", as well as the creation of multiple corridors of aid - including from Israel.
""There's no way it can all come in through Rafah,"" he says, referring to the only crossing point for humanitarian aid on Gaza's southern border with Egypt.
""The main road up and down Gaza has been destroyed... so to transport patients from the north down to Rafah will, I think, be well nigh impossible.
""And many of those patients - if there is still power in the hospitals, which is disappearing - may be on ventilators.""
More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,500 children - but Nick believes those numbers could be just the tip of the iceberg.
""As a result of the bombings there will be large numbers of deaths due to untreated cancers, untreated diabetes,"" he says.
""Until insulin was invented, diabetes killed everyone. Now, if they haven't got any insulin... diabetes will start killing people.
""If they've got no power, they can't give dialysis, so all patients in kidney failure will die, so that the amount of excess deaths will be huge in the next few months absolutely is a really important point.""
The World Health Organization has said a ""public health catastrophe"" was imminent in Gaza, due to mass displacement, overcrowding, and damage to water and sanitation infrastructure.
These conditions are perfect for the rapid spread of infectious diseases like cholera, Nick adds.
""They're drinking dirty, non-sterile water at the moment. The big danger is that infectious diseases just take control and run through the population...and that will lead to many, many thousands of deaths.""

Shockwaves from Israel-Hamas war disrupt US politics,2023-10-09,BBC,By Anthony Zurcher,"Israel's war with Hamas following the militant group's unprecedented and deadly weekend attack is also sending shockwaves through domestic US politics.
The crisis is creating new headaches for the Biden administration, sharpening the focus on the current turmoil in Congress and threatening to add an extra level of unpredictability to the 2024 US elections.
And while the American public tends to pay slight attention to events abroad, the horrifying images of civilian deaths from the Middle East - and the news that Americans are among the casualties - ensures that this story will grab the national attention.
Already Joe Biden's critics are lining up to place the blame for violence in Israel squarely at the president's feet.
They've accused Iran of masterminding the attack and say that US policies toward that nation, including allowing it to increase oil sales and have access to $6bn (£4.9bn) in frozen assets as part of a deal to achieve the release of some jailed American citizens, was a signal of American ""weakness"".
A senior administration official on Saturday said that was a ""ridiculous charge,"" adding that only non-Iranian third-party groups have had access to the $6bn, which can only be spent on humanitarian aid.
Former president Donald Trump, in a speech in New Hampshire on Monday, pledged to reinstate all US sanctions on Iran and reimpose a US travel ban on all ""terror-afflicted"" majority Muslim nations.
Mr Trump pointed to his successful negotiation of the Abraham Accords between Israel and two Persian Gulf states as an example of what had been a trend toward peace in the Middle East.
Some experts, however, have said that by bypassing the Palestinian issue, those accords - and the recent Biden administration push to normalise diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - may have been a contributing factor in the Hamas attack.
One of Mr Trump's presidential rivals, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, also accused Democratic administrations of being too soft on Iran.
""Ultimately, this was an attack by the Iranians,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said. ""US policy under both Biden and Obama, they just had rose-coloured glasses with respect to Iran.""
While the lion's share of Republican criticism was directed at Mr Biden, the attack on Israel also exposed some fault lines within the party - particularly on the changing views among conservatives on the merits of the kind of interventionist foreign policy that was long a hallmark of Republican presidencies.
Former vice-president Mike Pence used the moment to launch one of his most direct critiques of what he said was a nativist and isolationist worldviews of some of his Republican rivals.
""It's absolutely essential that we call out leaders in the Republican Party,"" he said in a statement released by his campaign. ""Voices of appeasement like Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis, I believe have run contrary to the tradition in our party where America is the leader of the free world.""
On Monday morning, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joined in with the Republican chorus blaming Mr Biden's policies for laying the groundwork for the attack.
Mr McCarthy was a victim of an uprising among right-wing conservatives, and his ousting has essentially frozen the chamber until Republicans can unite behind a new speaker - a process that could take at least several days more.
Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, the mastermind of the move against the then-speaker, dismissed accusations that his actions may have made it more difficult for the US Congress to come to Israel's aid, noting that America gives Israel $3bn (£2.45bn) in military support every year.
""There is no ask from Israel that we are unable to meet because it's going to take us a few days to pick a new speaker,"" he said, adding that the world doesn't spend much time thinking about Mr McCarthy's political career.
It was an opportunity for Mr McCarthy's supporters to get another round of digs at a colleague they now thoroughly revile.
""I look at the world and all the threats that are out there,"" Michael McCaul, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday. ""What kind of message are we sending to our adversaries when we can't govern, when we're dysfunctional, when we don't even have a Speaker of the House?""
The Biden administration has said there is no immediate need for a congressionally approved aid package for Israel. But two senior officials told US senators during a briefing today that new assistance should be included in a legislative package that also contains continued support for Ukraine.
Given the resistance to additional Ukraine funding among some Republicans, however, it remains to be seen whether such a move would make such an aid package more likely to pass - or less. A social media post earlier today by Republican Senator Josh Hawley seemed to suggest the latter.
""Israel is facing existential threat,"" he wrote. ""Any funding for Ukraine should be redirected to Israel immediately.""
If Republican fault lines have been exposed by the Israel crisis, the same cannot be said for divisions on the left - at least for the moment.
While the Democratic Party has traditionally been vocal advocates for Israel, that support has ebbed in recent years as the party has moved to the left and its criticism of the right-wing policies of Israel's Likud-led government - including its aggressive expansion of settlements in the occupied territories - has intensified.
A January 2023 Gallup Poll showed more Democrats sympathised with Palestinians (49%) than Israelis (38%) for the first time in the poll's 22-year history.
The ferocity and indiscriminate nature of the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians, however, has obscured these divisions.
While some far-left groups have rallied to express backing for the Palestinians, mainstream Democrats have been vocal in their support for Israel and quick to denounce signs of dissent from their side.
Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Cori Bush of Missouri, two of the more outspoken critics of Israel in the House of Representatives, offered sympathies for Israeli and Palestinian civilian casualties while calling for the end of US aid to Israel. Those comments prompted condemnation from several of their fellow Democrats.
""It sickens me that while Israelis clean the blood of their family members shot in their homes, they believe Congress should strip US funding to our democratic ally and allow innocent civilians to suffer,"" said Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey.
Ms Bush and Ms Tlaib are in the minority of their party for the moment. Bernie Sanders, one of the leaders of the progressive left, issued a statement on Saturday saying he absolutely condemned ""the horrifying attack"".
""There is no justification for this violence, and innocent people on both sides will suffer hugely because of it,"" he wrote on social media.
As headlines about Israeli civilian deaths are replaced by coverage of what could be a lengthy Israeli ground campaign in the Gaza Strip, however, the sentiment among Democrats could begin to shift to where it was earlier this year.
The situation in the Middle East has shifted dramatically in a matter of days. Given the existing cross-currents and partisan divisions inside the US, the domestic political dynamics of the current crisis are likely to be equally unpredictable.

Israel attack: London police patrols increase amid celebration claims,2023-10-08,BBC,By Yasmin Rufo & Jordan Reynolds,"Police patrols have increased across London after videos emerged of what appears to be people celebrating the Hamas attack on Israel.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman has said she expects the police to ""use the full force of the law"" against displays of support for Hamas.
The Met said it would provide a visible presence to ""reassure communities"".
On Saturday, Palestinian militants launched a major assault into Israel from Gaza.
Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, Ms Braverman said: ""Whenever Israel is attacked, Islamists and other racists use Israeli defensive measures as a pretext to stir up hatred against British Jews.
""Yesterday I spoke with CST—UK [Community Security Trust] to ensure the Government is doing everything necessary for the protection of our Jewish communities.
""There must be zero tolerance for antisemitism or glorification of terrorism on the streets of Britain.""
British man missing in Israel after Hamas attack
Immigration minister Robert Jenrick, has also urged the Met to increase patrols, claiming people were ""glorifying the terrorist activities of Hamas"".
People have shared videos on social media showing Palestinian flags being waved, beeping car horns and clapping.
Mr Jenrick urged the police to ""take this seriously"", adding that ""there is no place for this in the UK"".
In a statement, Scotland Yard said: ""We are aware of a number of incidents, including those that have been shared on social media, in relation to the ongoing conflict in Israel and the border with Gaza.
""The Met has increased policing patrols across parts of London in order to provide a visible presence and reassurance to our communities.
""Anyone who experiences threatening behaviour or is worried about their safety is urged to contact police.
""We will ensure that an appropriate policing plan is in place in order to balance the right to protest against any disruption to Londoners.""

Palestinian medical aid fundraiser scrapped by Borth venue,,BBC,By Jack Grey,"An event raising money for medical aid for Palestinians in Gaza has been called off by the venue set to host it.
The fundraiser, for UK charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, was due to be held at Borth Community Hall, Ceredigion, on 28 October.
Organiser Alex Harwood said she was ""hurt and dismayed"" by the hall's decision to cancel the event.
Ray Quant, hall committee chairman, said members did not want to be perceived as supporting only one side.
Ms Harwood said the aim of the event was to raise funds for those in need of ""medical or life-saving treatment as they are caught up in the most extreme violence and war through no fault of their own"".
""We were aware of the serious situation where medical aid for victims of conflict was scarce, particularly for children and we were moved to raise funds,"" she said.
Ms Harwood claimed the event was cancelled by the community hall committee as she was told it ""could be perceived that the venue would be seen as sympathetic to a terrorist attack"".
""All we hope is that somewhere along the line compassion and logic will prevail and allow us to raise these much-needed funds,"" she added.
In an email to Ms Harwood on 12 October, seen by the BBC, Mr Quant said: ""Our view is that with the present conflict we don't want it to be 'perceived' that the hall committee is promoting one of the protagonists.
""Even though many on both sides are innocent, because the present situation needs the United Nations or others to broker a humanitarian aid corridor to address the unfolding human crisis.""
Mr Quant said: ""My committee members feel it should be a fundraising event which supports both medical sides of the conflict.
""Borth Community Council has convened a meeting for Thursday evening and following that I will hold a further meeting with the hall committee.""
Isabelle Railton, Borth Community Council clerk, said: ""We're holding a meeting of the community council and any members of the public that would like to attend on Thursday at 19:00 BST.
""We are not the hall committee, but it has been brought to our attention by members of the public that are unhappy with the decision.""
The meeting will be held online and members of the public wishing to attend have been asked to contact the community council.
On 7 October, Palestinian militant group Hamaslaunched an attack on Israel, which saw its fighters enter communities near the Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,400 people, and taking many as hostages.
Nearly 2,700 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes and a ground offensive is also expected.
The largest UN agency in the Gaza Strip is on the verge of collapse, its chief commissioner said.
Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said in a speech from the agency's headquarters in East Jerusalemon Sunday: ""Gaza is being strangled and it seems that the world right now has lost its humanity.""
""If we look at the issue of water - we all know water is life - Gaza is running out of water, and Gaza is running out of life. Soon, I believe, with this there will be no food or medicine either,"" Mr Lazzarini said, calling the siege in Gaza as ""nothing else than collective punishment"".

Bowen: Five new realities after four weeks of Israel-Gaza war,2023-11-03,BBC,By Jeremy Bowen,"One of the first things to understand about the reportage, analysis and commentary that has poured out since the Hamas attacks of 7 October is that no-one has the full story. Not only is it, as ever, hard to penetrate the fog of war to work out what is happening on the battlefield. The new shape of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has not yet emerged.
Events are still moving fast. Fears that the war could spread are very real. New realities in the Middle East are out there somewhere, but their shape and the way that they will work depend on the way this war goes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond.
Here are a few things that we know, and a few that we do not. The list is not exhaustive. Some people mocked Donald Rumsfeld, US defence secretary at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he talked of ""unknown unknowns"". But in this part of the world as much as any other, they exist - and when they emerge, they can make a big difference.
One certainty is that Israelis support the military campaign to break the power in Gaza of Hamas and its junior partner, Islamic Jihad. Their anger is driven by the shock of the Hamas attacks, the killing of more than 1,400 people and the fact that around 240 hostages are still being held in Gaza.
I met Noam Tibon, a retired general in the Israeli army, to hear about how he drove down with his wife to Nahal Oz, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza, after Hamas attacked on 7 October. His mission, which was successful, was to rescue his son, his daughter in law and their two young daughters who were in their safe room, hearing Hamas gunmen roaming around outside.
Tibon may be retired but he is a very fit-looking 62-year-old. He ended up armed with an assault rifle and a helmet he had taken from a dead Israeli soldier, leading a group of soldiers he had assembled in the chaos of that day, clearing the kibbutz and saving the lives of his family and many others.
The general was an old-school, straight-talking Israeli officer.
""Gaza is going to suffer… no nation will agree that your neighbour will slaughter babies, women or people. Just like you (Britons) crushed your enemy during World War Two. This is what we need to do in Gaza. No mercy.""
What, I asked, about innocent Palestinian civilians who are getting killed?
""Unfortunately, it's happening. We live in a tough neighbourhood, and we need to survive… we have to be tough. We have no choice.""
A lot of Israelis are echoing his sentiment that Palestinian civilian deaths are unfortunate, but they are being killed because of the actions of Hamas.
It is also clear that Israel's assault on Hamas is causing terrible bloodshed. The latest figure for Palestinian deaths from Gaza's health ministry, run by Hamas, has exceeded 9,000 - of whom around 65% are children and women.
It is not clear how many of the men who have been killed were civilians or fighting for Hamas or Islamic Jihad. US President Joe Biden and the Israelis do not trust the ministry figures. But in past conflicts, Palestinian casualty statistics have been considered accurate by international organisations.
One grim milestone is fast approaching. The United Nations (UN) says around 9,700 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion 21 months ago.
Some of the Palestinian dead would have been part of Hamas. But even if that proportion is as high as 10%, which is unlikely, it means that Israel is on course to have killed as many Palestinian civilians in just over a month as Russia has killed in Ukraine since February 2022. (The UN says its data for Ukraine is incomplete and the true number of civilians killed is likely higher, while in Gaza the number of dead is also likely to be higher as many Palestinians are believed to be buried under rubble).
The UN human rights office has said that so many civilians have been killed and wounded in Israeli air strikes that it has serious concerns that the attacks are disproportionate and could be war crimes.
From the first days after the Hamas attacks, President Biden has supported Israel's decision to use military force to remove Hamas from power. But he has also added the qualification that it needed to be done ""the right way"". He meant that Israel should observe the laws of war that protect civilians.
The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv. Before he took off, he said: ""When I see a Palestinian child - a boy, a girl - pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child from Israel or anywhere else.""
I have reported on all of Israel's wars in the last 30 years. I do not remember a US administration stating so publicly that Israel needs to observe the laws of war. Blinken's visit suggests that he believes Israel is not following Biden's advice.
Something else we know for certain is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under great pressure.
Unlike Israel's security and military chiefs, he has not accepted any personal responsibility for the catastrophic series of failures that left Israeli border communities virtually undefended on 7 October.
Last Sunday, 29 October, he caused uproar when he sent out a tweet blaming the intelligence agencies. Mr Netanyahu deleted the message and apologised.
Three Israelis, a former peace negotiator, the ex-head of the Shin Bet (Israel's internal intelligence agency) and a tech entrepreneur, wrote an article in the journal Foreign Affairs saying that Mr Netanyahu should not have any part of the war and whatever follows. The Israeli PM has loyal supporters, but he has lost the confidence of prominent figures in Israel's military and security establishment.
Noam Tibon, the retired general who fought his way into kibbutz Nahal Oz to rescue his family, compares Mr Netanyahu to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who was forced to resign in 1940, and replaced by Winston Churchill.
Tibon told me: ""This is the biggest failure in the history of the state of Israel. It was a military failure. It was an intelligence failure. And it was the failure of the government… the one really in charge - and all the blame is on him - is the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu… He is in charge of the biggest failure in the history of Israel.""
It is also clear that the old status quo has been smashed. It was unpleasant and dangerous, but it seemed to have a certain grimly-familiar stability. Since the end of the last Palestinian uprising around 2005 a pattern has emerged that Mr Netanyahu believed could be sustained indefinitely. That was a dangerous illusion, for all concerned - Palestinians as well as Israelis.
The argument went that the Palestinians were no longer a threat to Israel. Instead, they were a problem to be managed. The tools available include sticks, carrots and the ancient tactic of ""divide and rule"".
Mr Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for most of the time since 2009 - after an earlier spell between 1996 and 1999 - has argued consistently that Israel does not have a partner for peace.
Potentially, it did. The Palestinian Authority (PA), which is the main rival to Hamas, is a deeply flawed organisation, and many who support it believe its aged President Mahmoud Abbas needs to step aside. But it accepted the idea of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel back in the 1990s.
""Divide and rule"" for Mr Netanyahu meant allowing Hamas to build its power in Gaza at the expense of the PA.
While Israel's longest-serving prime minister is always careful about what he says in public, his actions over many years show that he does not want to allow the Palestinians to have an independent state. That would involve giving up land in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which the Israeli right wing believes belongs to the Jews.
From time to time, Mr Netanyahu's pronouncements would leak. In 2019, a number of Israeli sources say that he told a group of his Likud members of parliament that if they opposed a Palestinian state they should support schemes to pump money - mostly provided by Qatar - into Gaza. He told them that deepening the division between Hamas in Gaza and the PA in the West Bank would make it impossible to establish a state.
It is also clear that Israel, backed by the Americans, will not tolerate a deal that allows Hamas to stay in power. That guarantees a lot more bloodshed. It also raises big questions about what or who replaces them, which so far have not been answered.
The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea has lasted for more than 100 years. One lesson of its long and bloody history is that there will never be a military solution.
In the 1990s, the Oslo peace process was established to try to end the conflict by establishing a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem alongside Israel. The last attempt to revive it, after years of on-off negotiations, happened during the Obama administration. It failed a decade ago, and since then the conflict has been allowed to fester.
As President Biden and many others have said, the only possible chance for avoiding more wars is to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That will not be possible with the current leaders on either side.  Extremists, both Israeli and Palestinian, would do all they could to scupper the idea, as they have done since the 1990s. Some of them believe they are following the will of God, which makes it impossible to persuade them to accept a secular compromise.
But if this war does not deliver enough of a shock to break deeply-held prejudices and to make the idea of two states viable, nothing will. And without a mutually-acceptable way of ending the conflict, more generations of Palestinians and Israelis will be sentenced to more wars.

How Hamas staged Israel lightning assault no-one thought possible,2023-10-08,BBC,By Sean Seddon and Daniele Palumbo,"Many Israelis would have been asleep when it began.
Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath and also a holy festival day, meaning families were planning to spend time at home together or in synagogue, and friends were meeting up.
But out of the dawn sky, a hail of rockets signalled the start of an attack that was unprecedented in its scale and co-ordination.
For years, Israel has fortified the barrier between itself and the small Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Within hours, its impenetrability was exposed as flawed.
BBC News has been analysing footage taken by militants and civilians on the ground to piece together how Hamas co-ordinated their most sophisticated attack ever from Gaza.
At around 06:30 local time, the rockets began to fly.
The Islamist militant organisation - which controls Gaza and is designated as a terrorist group in the UK and elsewhere around the world - uses this tactic frequently.
The rudimentary rockets often struggle to evade Israel's advanced Iron Dome missile defence system - but thousands were fired in a short space of time to overwhelm it.
The scale suggests months of planning and stockpiling. Hamas says it fired 5,000 in the first round (Israel says it was half that number).
Air raid sirens began to sound as far afield as Tel Aviv - 60km (38 miles) from Gaza-and western Jerusalem and smoke was seen rising above towns where there had been direct hits.
As the rockets continued to launch, fighters were gathering where they planned to penetrate the heavily fortified Gaza barrier.
Although Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, it still controls its airspace, shared border and shoreline.
As well as regular military patrols around the perimeter - which is a concrete wall in some places and a fence in others - there is also a network of cameras and sensors to prevent incursions.
But within hours, the barrier had been breached again and again.
Some Hamas fighters tried to bypass the barrier completely, including by flying over it on paragliders (unverified footage showed at least seven drifting above Israel) and by boat.
The Israel Defense Forces said they had repelled two Hamas attempts to cross into Israel by landing vessels on the beach.
But what sets this attack apart is the several co-ordinated, direct assaults on barrier crossing points.
At 05:50 local time, a Telegram account associated with Hamas's armed wing posted the first images from the ground, taken at Kerem Shalom - the most southern of Gaza's crossings.
They showed militants overrunning a checkpoint and the bloodied bodies of two Israeli soldiers on the ground.
Another image showed at least five motorbikes, each carrying two militants armed with rifles, passing through a hole which had been cut in the wire fence section of the barrier.
At a less guarded section, a bulldozer was seen demolishing a stretch of barbed wire-topped fencing.
Dozens of seemingly unarmed people were gathered there, and some began to run through the gap.
At Erez - the furthest north of the Gaza crossings, around 43.4km (27 miles) from Kerem Shalom - Hamas was swarming another crossing.
Footage was posted on one of the group's propaganda channels. It shows an explosion at the concrete barrier, which served as a signal to start the assault, and a militant can then be seen waving a group of fighters towards the blast site.
Eight men in bulletproof vests and carrying rifles run towards the heavily fortified checkpoint and fire at Israeli troops.
Later in the video, the bodies of Israeli soldiers are seen lying on the floor as the militants go from room to room sweeping the compound, clearly organised and trained.
Gaza has seven official crossings - six are controlled by Israel, one into Egypt is controlled by Cairo.
But within the space of a few hours, Hamas had found ways to enter Israeli territory along the length of the barrier.
Hamas fighters swept out of Gaza in all directions. We now know from the Israeli authorities that they assaulted 27 different locations, seemingly with orders to kill on sight.
The furthest Hamas penetrated was the town of Ofakim, which lies 22.5km (14 miles) east of Gaza. The map below shows the different areas they reached.
In Sderot, militants were seen standing on the back of a pick-up truck being driven through the town, which lies around 3km (1.8 miles) to the east of Gaza.
Around a dozen armed fighters were seen fanning out through the empty streets of Ashkelon, just to the north of the Erez crossing which had just been stormed.
Similar scenes were repeated across southern Israel and civilians were told by the military to hide indoors.
At a music festival near Re'im, gunmen fired at will at a large group of young people who had gathered in the desert.
An eyewitness told the BBC how the militants were driving around a van loaded with weapons and spent three hours searching the area for other Israelis to target.
We now know that hostages were taken from the festival and other locations and transported back into Gaza. Israel says 100 people - soldiers and civilians - have been abducted.
Footage taken in the town of Be'ri and verified by the BBC shows around four civilians being forcibly led away by militants.
Several videos have circulated online of Israelis, some of them heavily injured, being paraded through Gaza's crowded streets.
Other unverified atrocities too graphic to publish were captured on camera, including a motorist being dragged from his car and having his throat slashed, and the bodies of dead civilians and soldiers being defiled.
As well as targeting Israeli communities, Hamas also attacked two military sites: a base at Zikim and another at Re'im.
Footage taken from near Re'im shows the aftermath, with several burned-out cars scattered along the road to the base. It's unclear how many people were killed during the fighting.
Hamas's social media channels have repeatedly shared images of dead Israeli soldiers. BBC News has not verified these images.
Within just a few hours of the rocket barrage beginning, hundreds of Israelis were dead - and it happened in a way no-one thought was possible.
Help began to arrive in the stricken southern region within a few hours but Hamas, for a time, was in effective control of pieces of territory outside of Gaza.
The speed and deadliness of the surprise attack has stunned Israel. Questions over how it was able to happen will be asked for years.
By mid-morning, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared: ""We are at war.""

Jerusalem: Journalists attacked as Israeli nationalists march in Old City,2023-05-18,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"Thousands of Israeli nationalists have marched into the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, with violence directed at media covering the event.
The flag parade is part of Israel's Jerusalem Day, marking its capture of the east of the city in the 1967 war.
A group of marchers threw stones, sticks and bottles at Palestinian and foreign journalists at the Damascus Gate entrance.
They also cheered and chanted racist slogans, including ""Death to Arabs"".
Far-right Israeli cabinet ministers joined the procession. One of them, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, declared: ""Jerusalem is ours for ever.""
Palestinians along the route in occupied East Jerusalem earlier shuttered homes and shops over fears of abuse.
The march has increasingly become a show of force for Jewish ultranationalists, while for Palestinians it is seen as a blatant provocation undermining their ties to the city.
Racist, anti-Arab chants are often shouted by nationalist marchers. The event has in the past sparked much wider violence.
Israeli police vowed to stop law-breaking, but blamed regional ""terrorist elements"" for ""wild incitement"" about the march on social media. They also said it was only ""a small minority on both sides [who] try to agitate"".
Palestinian Authority leaders called the East Jerusalem events a ""provocative act"", saying far-right cabinet ministers Mr Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich - staunch supporters of the parade - were ""planting seeds of conflict"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the event would go ahead as planned.
Along the route in the Old City, Samir Abu Sbeih pulled down the shutters of his sweet shop, saying that police had advised Palestinian businesses to do so by mid-afternoon.
""It's not their land to celebrate,"" he said of the march. ""We live under occupation and that's why we have to accept it.""
Kebab restaurant owner Basti, who did not want to give his full name, said the event had become ""worse"" over the years.
""People, when they dance with the flag, sometimes they try to put the flag in your face, sometimes they spit on your face. And this is not nice.""
He said police told him he was not being forced to close, but that if he kept his business open, it would be at his own risk.
""For me, I just want to be inside. I don't like problems, for both sides,"" he said.
Jerusalem Day events have been marked by Israelis for decades, but in recent years, parts of the route have been the focus of spiralling tensions.
In the late afternoon, tens of thousands of Israelis headed from the west of Jerusalem to the Old City, ending with a so-called flag dance at the Western Wall, the holiest site for Jewish prayer.
Before that, marchers went their separate ways and thousands of mainly men and teenage boys headed into East Jerusalem.
They walked through Damascus Gate, which Israeli forces usually clear of Palestinians in advance, and then into the Old City's Muslim Quarter.
Previous years have seen groups of marchers chant ""death to Arabs"" and ""may your village burn"", while others banged the shutters of Palestinian shops.
One of the marchers, Pini, who didn't want to give his surname, said he had attended for decades to mark the day ""Jerusalem was reunited and returned to the hands of the Jewish people"".
""From 1948 to 1967, we were prevented from accessing the Western Wall,"" he said referring to the period that East Jerusalem was under Jordanian control. ""We returned to the Western Wall,"" he added.
Asked about a threatening atmosphere for Palestinians, he said he opposed any harassment. But, echoing highly controversial comments this year from a far-right minister, he added: ""There is no such thing as a Palestinian people; when was Palestine established? Is there a Palestinian king? Is there a Palestinian currency?""
Palestinian militant group Hamas warned Israel this week that it would reignite conflict, were it to cross ""red lines"" in Jerusalem during the event.
On flag march day in 2021, the group fired rockets at Jerusalem from the Gaza Strip as a week of boiling tensions exploded into war.
However, this year, with another round of conflict between Israel and Gaza militants ending only last weekend, appetite for escalation appeared lower.

Israel Gaza: Father loses 11 family members in one blast,2023-10-31,BBC,By Fergal Keane,"There is no mistaking what he sees as he climbs across the rubble.
The fabric lies bright against the grey rubble. Khalil Khader picks up the dusty and tattered child's pyjamas and is instantly overtaken by memories.
The toddler in her pyjamas. Rosa, his daughter, 18 months old, the baby of the family.
Khalil shows a video on his phone. Rosa wears the same blue nightwear and is holding the hands of two older cousins. The three of them dance in a circle.
The video was filmed in slow motion, so it seems as if the children are swaying in a gentle breeze. They are smiling. It is playtime and their lives have not yet been overtaken by war.
Khalil is a quiet spoken man, aged 36, a computer engineer at Al-Najjar hospital in Rafah, and the father of four young children: Ibrahim, aged nine; Amal, aged five; Kinan, two-and-a-half, and Rosa the last born.
Khalil steps carefully across the rubble. The house is only a few minutes walk from the hospital. There is now a mound of masonry and metal, household objects and some children's toys. A small drum. A toy piano.
On the night the missile struck - October 20 - Khalil was working at the hospital.
""A massive bomb exploded,"" he told one of my BBC colleagues who went with him to the scene of the attack.
""My neighbours were coming to the hospital. So I asked, 'Where was the bombing?' And they told me, 'It was around your house.' I had to run to the location to check on the family. I tried calling but no one was answering. And as you can see… the whole house was bombed.""
Eleven members of his family were killed.
They included his four children, his two sisters, his 70-year-old father, his brother and his sister-in-law, and their two daughters. They were wrapped in white shrouds in a courtyard of the hospital.
His wife was badly wounded. She is being treated for burns and other injuries sustained when the house collapsed.
Khalil had known war before in Gaza. The small strip of land - with a total land area of just 141 sq miles (365 sq km) - has seen relentless conflict over decades. Such was the legacy of conflict that he worried about raising a family there.
""I remember in the 2014 war, my wife was pregnant,"" he recalls, ""and our neighbours were bombed. She was in her seventh month and almost fell down the stairs from the blast. And I was thinking, how can I bring children into this life?""
But he imagined that a better life might be possible for them.
""I had a dream for each of my kids. Ibrahim was first in his school and I dreamed about seeing him as a doctor one day. Amal was very creative, she loved drawing. And she used to show me her drawings, and sometimes I would draw with her.
""Kinan was very playful - everyone loved him. And he used to take care of his little sister. He was always there to protect Rosa, and would say, 'Don't touch her, she's my baby!' And now they are all gone.""
Khalil is still searching for the body of his sister under the rubble. And he must support his wife in hospital. His children are gone.
But as he shows one photograph after another of Ibrahim, Amal, Kenin and Rosa, there is a tenderness in his eyes.
He will always be their father.

Gaza sees heaviest night of Israeli bombardment since start of war,2023-10-28,BBC,By David Gritten,"Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have experienced the heaviest night of Israeli bombardment since the war with Hamas began three weeks ago.
Hamas-run authorities said hundreds of buildings were destroyed in air and artillery strikes, and that at least 377 people were killed in the past day.
Israel's military said its warplanes hit 150 underground targets, including tunnels and other infrastructure.
Tanks and troops also went into the Strip and clashed with Hamas fighters.
The military said some soldiers would remain in the field, as Israel's defence minister declared that the war had entered a ""new phase"".
Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had entered the second stage of the war with Hamas.
He said additional Israeli ground forces have gone into what he called ""that stronghold of evil"" - referring to Gaza - to ""dismantle"" Hamas and bring hostages home.
""This will be a long and difficult war,"" Mr Netanyahu added.
Israel began its bombing campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by hundreds of Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 229 taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 7,700 people have been killed in the territory since then, and the UN is warning that a ""humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding"".
On Friday night, huge explosions lit up the sky as the Israeli military said it was ""operating powerfully on all dimensions in order achieve the goals of the war"", with ""ground forces... expanding their operations"".
At the same time, Palestinian mobile phone and internet networks went down, cutting off communications both inside the Strip and making it difficult to get accurate reports out.
Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it was fighting Israeli troops in the north-eastern town of Beit Hanoun and the central Bureij area, and that it had also fired barrages of rockets towards Israel.
On Saturday morning, the BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, described a scene of total chaos on the ground.
He said the bombardment of northern areas was on a scale he had never seen before. There were fewer strikes in southern areas, he added, but there was panic among the hundreds of thousands of people sheltering there after being told by Israel to leave their homes in the north.
The Israeli military said warplanes struck 150 underground targets in northern Gaza belonging to Hamas - which Israel, the UK and other powers class as a terrorist group - including ""tunnels, underground combat spaces and additional underground infrastructure"".
Later, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant declared: ""Last night, the earth in Gaza shook. We attacked above the ground and under it. We attacked terrorist operatives from all levels everywhere.
""The directives to the forces are clear: the operation will continue until further notice.""
Gaza Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal told AFP news agency that ""hundreds of buildings and houses were completely destroyed and thousands of other homes were damaged"" in the Israeli strikes, adding that they had ""changed the landscape"" of northern Gaza.
Photographer Shehab Younis posted a video on Instagram showing a badly wounded man being rushed out of a building and put into the back of a truck because there was no ambulance.
He told the BBC in a voice note that the situation was ""catastrophic"", with people unable to contact emergency services because all means of communication were down.
William Schomburg, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross sub-delegation in Gaza,told the BBC that hospitals had been operating non-stop to deal with the casualties.
""I've been able to visit different hospitals, including the Al-Quds hospital, and the scenes there are difficult to describe,"" he said.
""Healthcare workers that are operating around the clock while also dealing with a lot of personal tragedy. I spoke to one doctor who had lost his brother and cousin the night before.""
Mr Schomburg said healthcare facilities had also been transformed into centres for displaced civilians ""who fear that the only safe place for them is on a hospital floor"".
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which is hosting more than 600,000 of the 1.4 million people who have fled their homes - said that it lost most contact with its teams during what it described as the ""worst and most intensive night"" of bombings so far.
""The breaks in communications are making our work... extremely challenging,"" spokeswoman Juliette Touma said.
""We have lost so far 53 colleagues and are terrified that the number might have increased given the bombardment overnight.""
UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was surprised by the intensity of Israel's strikes.
""I was encouraged in the last days by what seemed to be a growing consensus... for the need of at least a humanitarian pause in the fighting to facilitate the release of hostages in Gaza, the evacuation of third country nationals and the necessary massive scale up of the delivery of humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza,"" he said.
""Regrettably, instead of the pause, I was surprised by an unprecedented escalation of the bombardments and their devastating impacts, undermining the referred humanitarian objectives.""
Israel also cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.
It has allowed 84 lorries carrying aid to cross from Egypt over the past week, but the UN has called that a ""drop in the ocean"". About 500 aid lorries per day were coming into Gaza before the war began.
There have been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations.
Israel refuses to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also accuses Hamas of hoarding fuel.

Controversial land sale puts Jerusalem Armenians on edge,2023-06-19,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"Wearing peaked black headdresses and long robes, a procession of Armenian priests is led along the stone streets of Jerusalem's Old City by two suited men in felt tarboosh hats with ceremonial walking sticks.
Quietly, apart from the tapping of the sticks, they file into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for prayers.
Nowadays, Jerusalem is at the core of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. But Armenians have been here since the 4th Century, when their country was the first to adopt Christianity as a national religion.
They have a share in the Old City's holiest Christian sites and their own quarter tucked away in its south-western corner, home to some 2,000 Armenians.
But now the community here feels under threat because of a murky real estate deal by its own Church leaders. Amid angry protests, the Armenian patriarch has hidden himself away and a disgraced priest, who denies any wrongdoing, has fled to California.
""It's like a puzzle. I mean, we are trying to know what happened, when it happened, and how,"" explains community activist Hagop Djernazian.
What has emerged is that some 25% of the Armenian Quarter has been sold on a 99-year lease to a mysterious Jewish Australian businessman for a luxury development.
The land includes a large car parking area - one of the few areas of open land inside the Old City walls - which his company has already taken over. Many Armenians had hoped the site could be used to build affordable housing for young couples from their tiny, shrinking community.
According to plans seen unofficially by Hagop and others, an Ottoman-era building housing five Armenian households, a restaurant, shops and the seminary are all part of the sell-off. Many fear this could affect the viability of living in the quarter in the long-term.
But the controversy extends far more widely.
""It is historical land that we have had for 700 years. Losing it with one signature will affect our cultural daily life, but it will also change the picture of Jerusalem,"" Hagop says. ""It will change the status quo, the entire mosaic of Jerusalem.""
As the Orthodox Easter celebrations took place in April, panic was spreading among Armenians. The Armenian Patriarch, Nourhan Manougian, admitted that he had signed away the land but said he had been deceived by a local priest who worked for him.
That priest was defrocked and later there were heated scenes as he was banished from the Armenian Quarter, escorted away under Israeli police protection as residents yelled out ""traitor"".
Recently, many Armenians have been joining weekly protests, linking arms and singing nationalistic songs below the window of the patriarch who now stays cloistered in his rooms at the convent. They demand that he revokes the land deal.
Amid a recentrise in attacks by extremist Jews targeting Christians in Jerusalem, some Armenians see the sale as an act of self-inflicted harm on the Christian presence here.
""The look of the city, its character is changing very much,"" says Arda, who lives in the Old City and complains that religious nationalists already feel emboldened by the drift of Israeli politics.
""Priests walking in the streets find settlers spitting at them, people say they don't want to see Christmas trees in the city, and restaurants are being attacked for no reason. It's all going in a certain direction.""
Israel captured East Jerusalem - including the Old City - from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War and went on to occupy and annex it in a move that is not recognised internationally. In the decades since, it has been at the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, claimed by both sides as their capital. Plots of land here are fiercely fought over.
There is a reminder of that near to the Armenian Quarter, at Jaffa Gate - the iconic entrance to the Christian Quarter.
Here, two landmark hotels, run by Palestinians, were secretly sold to foreign firms acting as fronts for a radical Jewish settler group. The Greek Orthodox Church lost a two-decade-long battle to cancel the deal in the Israeli courts and last year settlers moved into part of one of the hotels.
Armenian elders say that in the past, there have been frequent approaches by settlers wanting to buy land in their quarter and increase the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem. The Armenian Quarter is located next to the Jewish one, which makes it especially desirable.
However, a spokesman for the settler group which bought the Jaffa Gate properties told the BBC he had no knowledge of the Armenian land sale.
Meanwhile, in interviews in the US, the cast-out priest, Baret Yeretsian, has dismissed the idea that the buyer of the land lease - named as Danny Rothman but also Daniel Rubinstein in some documents - is driven by ideology.
Nevertheless, Palestinian Christian leaders say the sale has political implications.
""It undermines any future political solution to Jerusalem,"" says Dimitri Diliani, president of the National Christian Coalition of the Holy Land. ""According to international law, it's on occupied land that is subject to negotiations and this kind of reinforces the illegal settler presence in Palestinian East Jerusalem.""
He believes that ""the diversity"" of Jerusalem will also be badly affected.
Highlighting the significance of the Armenian Church's actions, both the Palestinian President and Jordan's King Abdullah II - custodian of Jerusalem's Christian holy sites - have suspended their recognition of the patriarch. This affects his ability to attend ceremonies and sign off on official church business.
Israel's foreign ministry has said it is aware of the Armenian patriarch's deal but due to the political sensitivity it refrains from commenting on it.
Meanwhile, in the walled courtyards of St James Convent - which has been home to many Armenian families since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and has its own clubs, school, library and even a football pitch - the talk nowadays is about little else.
Relations have been strained between the residents and clergy members, who act here as the religious and civil authority. On Friday, dozens of Armenian Jerusalemites gathered to hear from a group of international Armenian lawyers who have been visiting and have agreed to draw up recommendations on how to handle the case.
Nearby, in his ceramics shop, Garo Sandrouni paints glaze onto an ornately decorated bowl wondering what the future will bring.
He is from one of the families that brought the colourful tradition of Armenian pottery to Jerusalem a century ago, when they fled from what is widely seen as a genocide by the Turks.
He says that Armenians historically donated money to buy land in this holy city - their spiritual homeland - and that the Church has no right to sell it.
""This is what makes us angry. These lands belong to the Armenian nation. They don't belong to the Armenian patriarchate of Jerusalem,"" he tells me.
""The Armenian patriarchate of Jerusalem has to take care of these lands to keep them to preserve them, to protect them.""

Israel targets Hamas’s labyrinth of tunnels under Gaza,2023-10-12,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israel says it is striking parts of a secret labyrinth of tunnels built underneath the Gaza Strip by Hamas, as it continues to retaliate for the Palestinian Islamist militant group's unprecedented cross-border attack on Saturday.
""Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas. We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built,"" anIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said in a video on Thursday.
""These aren't bunkers for Gazan civilians. It's only for Hamas and other terrorists so that they can continue to fire rockets at Israel, to plan operations, to launch terrorists into Israel,"" they claimed.
It is very difficult to assess the size of the network, which Israel has dubbed the ""Gaza Metro"" because it is believed to stretch beneath a territory that is only 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide.
Following a conflict in 2021, the IDF said it had destroyed more than 100km of tunnels in air strikes. Hamas meanwhile claimed that its tunnels stretched 500km and that only 5% were hit. To put those figures into perspective, the London Underground is 400km long and is mostly above ground.
Tunnel construction began in Gaza before Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005.
But it was ramped up after Hamas took control of the Strip two years later, which prompted Israel and Egypt to begin restricting the movement of goods and people in and out for security reasons.
At its peak,almost 2,500 tunnels running underneath the Egyptian border were used to smuggle in commercial goods, fuel and weaponsby Hamas and other militant groups.
The smuggling became less important to Gaza after 2010, when Israel began allowing more goods to be imported through its crossings. Egypt later shut the smuggling down by flooding or destroying the tunnels.
Hamas and other factions also started digging tunnels to attack Israeli forces.
In 2006, militants used one underneath the border with Israel to kill two Israeli soldiers and seize a third, Gilad Shalit, who they held captive for five years.
In 2013, the IDF discovered a 1.6km-long, 18m-deep tunnel lined with a concrete roof and wallsleading from the Strip to land near an Israeli kibbutz after residents heard strange sounds.
The following year, Israel cited the need to eradicate the threat of attacks by militants using such ""terror tunnels"" under the frontier for a major air and ground offensive in Gaza.
The IDF said its forces destroyed more than 30 tunnels during the war. But a group of militants were also able to use one to mount an attack in which four Israeli soldiers were killed.
""The cross-border tunnels tend to be rudimentary, meaning they have barely any fortification. They are dug for a one-time purpose - invading Israeli territory,"" says Dr Daphné Richemond-Barak, an expert on underground warfare who teaches at Reichman University in Israel.
""The tunnels inside Gaza are different because Hamas is using them on a regular basis. They are probably more comfortable to be in for longer periods of time. They are definitely equipped for a longer, sustained presence.""
""The leaders are hiding there, they have command-and-control centres, they use them for transport and lines of communication. They are equipped with electricity, lighting and rail tracks. You can move around more and stand.""
She says Hamas appears to have ""perfected the art"" of tunnel building and warfare in recent years, having learned a huge amount by observing the tactics of Syrian rebel fighters in Aleppo and jihadist militants from the Islamic State (IS) group in Mosul.
The tunnels inside Gaza are believed to be as much as 30m (100ft) below the surface and have entrances located on the bottom floors of houses, mosques, schools and other public buildings to allow militants to evade detection.
Building the network has also come at a cost to the local population. The IDF has accused Hamas of diverting millions of dollars given to Gaza in aid to pay for the tunnels as well as tens of thousands of tons of cement intended for rebuilding homes destroyed in previous wars.
It is possible that a cross-border tunnel was used by Hamas militants during last weekend's attacks in Israel, in which at least 1,300 people were killed, most of them civilians, and more than 150 others were taken as hostages. There were reports that a tunnel exit was discovered near the kibbutz of Kfar Aza, where dozens of civilians were massacred.
If that is confirmed, the tunnel would have been built beneath the underground concrete barrier studded with sophisticated anti-tunnel detection sensors whichIsrael finished installing at the end of 2021.
Dr Richemond-Barak says it would be a shock, but stresses that no tunnel detection system is fool-proof. ""This is why tunnels have been used for time immemorial in war, because is there no way to prevent them.""
She also cautions that it is unrealistic for the Israeli establishment and general public to believe it will be possible for the IDF to destroy Hamas's entire network of tunnels in Gaza, as hundreds of thousands of troops mass nearby for a possible ground operation.
""There will be parts of the network where civilians, for whatever reason, will not evacuate... Some parts of the underground network are unknown. And for some of them the collateral damage will be too high.""
Destroying the tunnels will also lead to a significant loss of life - among Israeli forces on the ground, Palestinian civilians and the hostages, she warns.
More than 1,500 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them civilians, have already been killed in retaliatory Israeli air strikes since Saturday.
""Hamas is very good at using human shields. Once a strike is imminent and they know it, they will put innocent civilians on top of buildings. That has forced Israel to cancel strikes many times,"" Dr Richemond-Barak says.
""Having mastered the technique, Hamas could easily use it in the context of the tunnels and simply put Israeli, American and other hostages inside them.""
During the 2021 conflict, a series of devastating air strikes in Gaza City brought three residential buildings crashing to the ground, killing 42 people. The IDF said it targeted underground tunnels, but that when they collapsed the building's foundations collapsed too.
The tunnel network will also negate the advantages that the IDF has in terms of technology and intelligence, magnify the difficulties of urban warfare, and pose a lethal threat to Israeli troops, according to Dr Richemond-Barak.
""First of all, Hamas has had plenty of time to booby-trap the entire network,"" she says. ""They could just let the soldiers enter into the tunnel network and then eventually blow the whole thing up.""
""They could kidnap [the soldiers in surprise attacks]. And then you have all the other risks - running out of oxygen, fighting the enemy in one-on-one combat, and rescuing wounded soldiers becomes virtually impossible.""
She adds: ""Even if you don't go inside the tunnel, to secure an area where you suspect that tunnels might be present is very different from just securing an area in general. Here, you have to secure something that is invisible.""
The Israeli forces will, however, have some ways to mitigate the risks.
According to Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group security consultancy, these might include sending drones and unmanned vehicles into tunnels to map them and identify booby traps before soldiers clear them.
Warplanes could also drop ""bunker busting"" bombs, which penetrate deep into the ground before detonating. However, they would pose a risk of collateral damage due to the dense urban terrain.

Israel Gaza: 33 Palestinians released on fourth day of truce,2023-11-28,BBC,By Sam Hancock,"More Palestinians have been freed from Israeli prisons on the fourth day of a truce between Israel and Hamas.
The release of 33 people means 150 Palestinians have been released since Friday - the day both sides began swapping hostages and prisoners.
Fifty-one Israeli hostages, including three-year-old-twin sisters, have been freed by Hamas as part of the deal.
Qatar has said the pause in fighting will be extended by two days, which Israel has not confirmed or denied.
Little information has been released about the latest group of Palestinians to be freed.
On Monday both Hamas and Qatar - which has played a major role in the talks between the warring sides - said 30 Palestinian children and three women were due to be freed.
The Israel Prison Service later said 33 people had been freed from Ofer prison in the West Bank, and a detention centre in Jerusalem, but did not specify their genders or ages.
By the evening, Reuters news agency reported that a bus carrying the newly released Palestinian prisoners had arrived in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.
Images showed people in the Palestinian city, waiting to greet them - some carrying green flags of Hamas, their faces covered with balaclavas.
Separate images showed a Palestinian boy named Muhammad Abu Al-Humus reuniting with his mother, and other family members, at the family's home in East Jerusalem.
Al-Humus called his release ""an indescribable joy"" and kissed his mother's hand, the AFP news agency reports.
It was not immediately clear which facility he had been detained in, or for how long.
Eitaf Jaradat, one of the three Palestinian women released in the latest exchange, said ""the price of our freedom is seemingly expensive"" as she was welcomed back by her family.
""We always hope that we are freed and that our people are in a good situation. But this is our destiny that we were freed while they are on a sea of blood,"" she told Reuters.
Ms Jaradat was arrested in 2021, accused of involvement in a shooting that caused the death of an Israeli settler, according to Reuters.
While fighting between Hamas and Israel is temporarily suspended, aid organisations have taken the opportunity to send lorries into Gaza filled with essentials such as food, water, fuel and medicines.
Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children, should a two-day extension of the truce go ahead.
Israel has not commented explicitly on the extension, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Monday evening that it had ""approved the inclusion of 50 female prisoners in the list of prisoners eligible to be released, in the event that a release of additional Israeli hostages is carried out"".

"'I wake up and check if my family in Gaza is still alive,' says Palestinian American",2023-10-13,BBC,By Brandon Drenon,"Dorgham Abusalim has not heard from his parents in Gaza for days. The wait is ""absolutely horrifying"", he says.
Since he last spoke to them on Tuesday, Dorgham has been glued to the television, watching the Israeli bombing of Gaza, and watching the death toll climb.
On Whatsapp, he learned of one family in Deir al-Balah that lost 20 relatives in a single night. ""That's my family's neighbourhood,"" he tells the BBC from his home in Washington DC.
He is one of many Palestinian-Americans whose days are now marked by sporadic, anxious messages and calls with family and friends thousands of miles away.
More than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the strikes began, in retaliation for the killing of 1,300 people and kidnapping of about 150 people in Israel by Hamas militants.
About 2.2 million people live in the territory, which is controlled by Hamas. On Thursday night, Israel told everyone in the north - about 1.1 million people - to relocate to the south within 24 hours.
""Any place from which Hamas operates will turn into rubble,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said.
For Dorgham, 34, witnessing the war unfold from afar is terrifying and paralysing. He says he is keenly aware that any goodbye may well be the last.
""I can't go to bed without wanting to hear their voice,"" Dorgham says of his parents. ""I'm going to continue calling and calling until I get through.""
Israel turned off the water, energy and gas to Gaza on Saturday, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian disaster as hospitals run short on fuel and people struggle to store food.
As the electricity supplies dwindle, so do Dorgham's chances of hearing his mother's voice.
""Their electricity has gone down from four hours to two hours to one hour a day,"" Dorgham says, adding that his family are scrambling every day to find fuel.
""Some of my family are fleeing south,"" he says, ""but many are staying for fear they will never be able to return to their homes.""
Tariq Luthun, a 32-year-old Palestinian-American living in Detroit, Michigan, says his extended family in Gaza does not have power, so is trying to use their phones sparingly.
""They are safe as of this interview, or as of this moment,"" Tariq tells the BBC, but he says he worries about them constantly.
""Every day I wake up, I check to see if family members are alive,"" he says. ""Then I go to work. After I log off work, I check again to see if my family members are still alive.""
The stress of this routine is taking an emotional toll. ""I'm really devastated. It weighs on me.""
Palestinian-Americans who spoke to the BBC say they feel the plight of civilians in Gaza is being forgotten as the majority of US politicians declare their support for Israel.
In a speech on Tuesday, President Joe Biden said Israel had a right and duty to respond to the attacks.
He was careful to say that Hamas ""does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination"", but his speech was seen by many analysts as giving a green light to Israel to proceed with a full-scale ground operation, which would likely result in more civilian deaths.
""In the past you'd see the both-sides-ism,"" Tariq says. ""You don't see that here.""
Dorgham says harsh rhetoric from politicians in Israel and the US - like Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggesting that Israel ""level the place"" - makes him feel hopeless.
""It feels to me that we live in a world that categorically hates us. Why?""
Iman Kishawi, who was born in Gaza in 1958 but fled because of war when she was seven years old, says she worries constantly about her aunts and cousins who are still there.
""I don't know what to do,"" she says from her home in Los Angeles, describing how she paces back and forth around the house. ""They don't have phones. They don't have electricity. They are under constant bombardment.""
She relies on updates from other relatives in the US who have been able to get in touch with her cousins.
Speaking to them brings back memories of her childhood in Gaza, she says, including trips to the beach, where dozens of relatives would gather for family picnics. ""The sea was beautiful. Really, really beautiful,"" she says.
Such moments of nostalgia offer only a brief respite from the daily worry that her cousins could be victims of the next bomb strike.
She's been told they are OK, for now.
""When my cousin says OK, it means this second we're OK,"" she explains. ""They don't know what's going to happen next.""

What is the Rafah crossing and why is it Gaza's lifeline?,2023-11-01,BBC,,"The first civilians from the Gaza Strip have crossed the Rafah border into Egypt since the Israel-Gaza war started.
Dozens of severely injured Palestinians were taken in ambulances and hundreds of foreign passport holders made the crossing on Wednesday.
Egypt said it would initially allow in more than 80 injured and more than 500 foreign and dual nationals in total, in a deal said to have been brokered by Qatar.
This is the first such evacuation since the conflict began more than three weeks ago. It is not clear how long the border will stay open.
It has already been open for more than 10 days to allow aid into Gaza. So far, more than 200 trucks have crossed the border, but much more is needed.
It's the southernmost post of exit from Gaza and borders Egypt's Sinai peninsula.
There are only two other border crossings from and into the Gaza Strip - Erez, a crossing into Israel in northern Gaza, which is for people, and Kerem Shalom, a solely commercial goods junction with Israel in southern Gaza. Both are shut.
Gunmen from the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked the Erez crossing on 7 October during an unprecedented assault on southern Israel which killed more than 1,300 people.
Days later, Israel declared Erez and Kerem Shalom closed until further notice, leaving the Rafah border as the only way into and out of the Strip for people.
Rafah is now also the only crossing point for humanitarian aid.
Hamas and Egypt exercise control over who can pass through, but operations have been disrupted since Israel began conducting waves of air strikes on Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's assault.
Egyptian media said the crossing was shut down following three Israeli strikes on 9 and 10 October, which it said left injuries on the Egyptian and Palestinian sides of the border.
On 12 October, the Egyptian government asked Israel to halt strikes near the Rafah border crossing so it could serve as a ""support lifeline"" for people in Gaza, and made it clear that it would not open the passage until there were guarantees for the safety of its staff.
Three weeks later, people are gathering at the border following reports that Qatar has mediated an agreement to allow some people out of Gaza.
Reuters news agency says the Gulf state has been holding talks between Egypt, Israel and Hamas, in coordination with the US.
It is this deal that is allowing some critically injured people and foreign passport holders out of the Gaza Strip.
Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas - which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012.
Israel and Egypt have restricted the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. The two countries say their blockade is needed for security reasons.
As part of its response to Hamas's deadly attack, Israel's defence minister ordered a ""complete siege"" of Gaza on 9 October, adding: ""There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.""
Meanwhile Egypt fears a massive influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war.
Egypt's president warned on 12 October that an exodus from Gaza risked ""liquidating"" the Palestinian cause and called on Palestinians to ""remain steadfast on their land"".
It is also concerned about the possibility of Islamist militants coming into the country, having faced a jihadist insurgency in Sinai for almost a decade.
It is not easy for Palestinians to leave Gaza via Rafah. Palestinians wishing to use the crossing must register with the local Palestinian authorities two to four weeks in advance and may be rejected by either the Palestinian or Egyptian authorities with little warning or explanation.
According to the UN, in August 2023, the Egyptian authorities allowed 19,608 exits from Gaza and denied entry to 314 people.

Airlines cancel or delay flights to Israel as fighting continues,2023-10-09,BBC,By Daniel Thomas & Katy Austin,"Major airlines around the world have cancelled flights to Israel or warned of travel disruption as the security situation deteriorates.
Virgin Atlantic warned of cancellations and delays to Tel Aviv and British Airways (BA) has altered its schedule.
Meanwhile, three US carriers, as well as Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates, have suspended services.
Palestinian militants Hamas said that they had targeted Israel's Ben Gurion airport with missiles on Monday.
About 700 people have been killed in Israel since Hamas launched its attack on Saturday, with a further 500 having died in Gaza in retaliatory air strikes.
The Foreign Office isadvising against all but essential travelto Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and against all travel to certain parts of the region.
Virgin Atlantic said it had made eight cancellations between Tel Aviv and London Heathrow, from Saturday until this coming Wednesday.
""The safety and security of our customers and our people always comes first and our flying programme to Israel remains under constant review,"" a spokesperson said.
UK budget carrier Wizz Air confirmed it had cancelled flights to and from Tel Aviv until further notice, while EasyJet halted flights on Sunday and Monday, adding that it would alter it schedule for the rest of this week.
BA has changed its daily flights from Heathrow to Tel Aviv so that they depart in the morning instead of the afternoon. It is understood this is to avoid crew having to stay overnight in Israel.
The airline said it was keeping the situation under review. A spokesperson said a flexible booking policy had been brought in so customers could change their travel dates free of charge if they wished.
Flight checking website FlightRadar24 showed some flights still arriving in and departing from Tel Aviv on Monday morning, including by Ryanair and Pegasus.
However, Ryanair subsequently said it had been forced to cancel a number of flights to and from Tel Aviv on Monday and advised passengers to check for the latest flight updates.
On Sunday, US carriers United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said they had suspended direct flights to Israel.
In a statement, United said its flights would be paused ""until conditions allow them to resume"".
Delta said flights ""have been cancelled into this week"".
Meanwhile, 300 Polish and Hungarian nationals have been evacuated on flights, with Thailand and Nepal said to be considering similar moves.
Royal Caribbean, the cruise operator, said it was ""adjusting several itineraries in the area"" and was notifying affected customers.

Palestinian-American couple and baby boy finally escape Gaza,2023-11-02,BBC,By Sam Cabral,"A Palestinian-American family has managed to flee Gaza after nearly a month trapped in the war-torn enclave.
Abood Okal, Wafaa Abuzayda and their one-year-old son, Yousef, crossed safely into Egypt through the Rafah crossing on Thursday morning, a family friend told the BBC.
The trio were among a list of 400 US citizens and 100 others approved by border authorities to leave Gaza.
But several hundred more foreign nationals remain inside the enclave.
For the Okals, who reside in the quiet Boston suburb of Medway, Massachusetts, the war shattered a joyful reunion with the grandparents Yousef had never met.
After flying into Tel Aviv last month, they took in the sights of Jerusalem, journeyed through the West Bank, went to the beach, shared meals and rode horses together.
Then, six days before they were to catch a flight back to Boston, Hamas launched its attack on Israel, which responded by bombarding Gaza.
Heeding Israel's warnings to flee south, the Okals left Ms Abuzayda's parents' home in Jabalia, in northern Gaza. They do not know if the house - which is in the vicinity of a refugee camp that was bombed on Tuesday - remains intact.
By the following weekend, they had made their way to Rafah and holed up in a house about five minutes from the border crossing into Egypt.
""The general understanding was that, if there was going to be any opportunity for American citizens to get out, it was going to be through Egypt,"" Sammy Nabulsi, a family friend, said.
According to Mr Nabulsi, over the past three weeks Mr Okal attempted to make daily contact with the US state department and the American embassies in Cairo and Jerusalem.
On four separate occasions, they were advised to go to the Rafah crossing, waiting in line for up to eight hours but never receiving permission to cross.
Mr Nabulsi, who told the BBC he spoke with the family nearly every day of their ordeal.
A real estate lawyer by trade, he said he contacted White House and state department officials, as well as several members of the US Congress, on the Okals' behalf.
But, he told the BBC, officials offered vague and shifting explanations for why his friends were unable to get out.
It was an experience that left him concerned the government was not prioritising rescuing its citizens from Gaza, and left the Okals feeling ""completely hopeless and abandoned"".
All the while, the family's circumstances were growing more dire with each passing day.
The house in Rafah where they were staying was a single-family unit, but they shared it with 40 others.
With no running water or fuel, the residents were limiting how often they flushed the toilets and drinking saltwater from the well to stay hydrated.
With no cooking oil on hand, the family was largely living off canned tuna and fava beans, according to Mr Nabulsi.
Their last visit to the bakery lasted six hours and their last water run yielded only a few litres for the whole house to share.
But the hardest part for Mr Okal and Ms Abuzayda was watching how the conditions were affecting their son, said Mr Nabulsi.
When the war broke out, Yousef had occasionally woken up startled by the sound of airstrikes.
But more recently, he had begun to wake up screaming, apparently from night terrors, even when it was quiet outside. Oftentimes, he was inconsolable and would not go back to sleep.
""In the early days, every time there was an airstrike, [his mum] would try to smile and clap to convince him it was just fireworks,"" Mr Nabulsi said.
A few days ago, he added, they had run out of milk and were unable to find any more.
Mr Nabulsi says Mr Okal is a research director at the Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company, and that Ms Abuzayda worked at a Boston non-profit for young adults.
On Thursday, the family's names appeared on a list published by Gaza's border authority with permission to enter Egypt.
Mr Nabulsi confirmed to the BBC the trio crossed into Egypt shortly after 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) and was being transported to Cairo by US consular affairs officials.
""The Okal family is overwhelmed with the love and support they have received from home and abroad, but they are also exhausted, physically and emotionally drained, and have a long journey ahead of them back to the United States,"" he said in a statement.
The family, he added, is asking for privacy and the safe departure of all remaining Americans, as well as ""compassion and prayers for the innocent civilians in Gaza, who gave them shelter, who helped them find food and water, but who continue to be without their own supply of food, water, fuel, or medicine to live"".

Ahed Tamimi: Israeli forces arrest Palestinian activist in West Bank,,BBC,By David Gritten,"The prominent Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi has been arrested by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.
Ms Tamimi, 22, was detained overnight in the village of Nabi Saleh, the Palestinian Prisoners' Society said.
Israel's military told AFP news agency she was suspected of ""inciting violence and terrorist activities"".
Israeli media reported that Ms Tamimi was arrested in connection with a post on Instagram that threatened to ""slaughter"" Jewish settlers.
""[By comparison] you will say that what Hitler did to you was a joke,"" she is purported to have written, referring to the mass murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany,according to the newspaper Haaretz.
The post is no longer visible online, nor is the account carrying Ms Tamimi's name and photo where it was published last week.
Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, posted a photograph on X, formerly known as Twitter, that appeared to show an Israeli soldier restraining Ahed Tamimi in a bedroom.
He accused her of expressing ""sympathy and support for the Nazi human beings on social media"" and vowed: ""Zero tolerance with terrorists and supporters of terrorism!""
However, Ms Tamimi's mother, Nariman, denied that she wrote the post.
""There are dozens of [online] pages in Ahed's name with her photo, with which she has no connection,"" she told AFP.
Ahed Tamimi became an international symbol of resistance to Israel's occupation as a teenager.
In 2015, the then-14-year-old was photographed biting an Israeli soldier who was trying to detain her younger brother.
Two years later,she was arrested after being filmed slapping and kicking an Israeli soldierduring a confrontation outside her home. An Israeli court subsequently sentenced her to eight months in prison.
The Palestinian Prisoners' Society said Ms Tamimi was one of at least 70 Palestinians arrested in Israeli raids across the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem on Sunday night.
That raised to 2,150 the total reportedly detained there since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 were taken hostage.
Israel has bombarded Gaza continuously since then and sent in ground forces more than a week ago with the aim of destroying Hamas. More than 9,700 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
The West Bank has seen an alarming surge in violence at the same time.
According to the UN,141 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most of them during confrontations that followed Israeli search-and-arrest raids or during protests in solidarity with Gaza.
It says eight others have been killed by Israeli settlers, whohuman rights groups have accused of escalating a campaign of violent attacks on Palestinian communities.
Two Israelis have been killed by Palestinians over the same period.
Some 600,000 Jews live in 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.
Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.

Gaza family tell of desperate journeys to border in search of safety,2023-10-24,BBC,By Hamzah Abbas & Lauren Hirst,"A father-of-four in Gaza has told of his family's repeated desperate attempts to reach the border with Egypt in the hope of escaping to safety.
Emad Abuaassi fled from the north with his wife and children as the Israel airstrikes began.
In voice notes sent to the BBC, Mr Abuaassi said they had tried in vain to crossthe closed Rafah crossing, driving with rockets flying overhead.
""Every time we go there, we just suffer,"" he said.
""I can't explain anymore how it is. Absolute disaster. I have never seen or experienced anything like this in all our lives.""
The family moved from Blackpool in Lancashire to the Gaza Strip, where members of Mr Abuaassi's family still live, just under a year ago. His wife and children have British passports.
Since fleeing the north, they have been staying in Mr Abuassi's brother's flat in the city of Khan Younis.
Still more than eight miles from the Rafah crossing, he told how the family had made ""four or five"" perilous drives to get there in the hope of being allowed to cross.
""The dangerous bit is to reach the border. And the dangerous bit again is to get back home from the border,"" he said.
""Every time we go there, we just suffer. All day in the sun and rockets fly over our heads.
""I don't want to go unless we know for definite the border is open.""
Speaking on Monday, Mr Abuaassi's wife Stephanietold how ""nowhere is safe"".
It has now been almost three weeks since Hamas launched its unprecedented attacks on Israel, killing 1,400 people.
Israel has retaliated with intense bombing which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,800 people.
""We can't get out. We're living here in a two-bedroom flat [with] about 50 people,"" Mr Abuaassi said.
""The situation is absolutely bad. We're struggling for food, we're struggling for water, we're struggling for everything.
""We've just managed to have half a sandwich - me and my kids this morning.
""All our flat was destroyed, everything destroyed,"" he said.
""We managed to get out with just a tiny bit of money and just quickly ran to the hospital.
""We slept in the hospital the whole night.
""The next morning my brother came and he took us to his flat in Khan Younis and now we remain here but the situation is difficult and I hope something happens soon.""
The Gaza Strip only has two other border crossings, both with Israel - Erez, a crossing for people in northern Gaza and Kerem Shalom, a solely commercial goods junction in southern Gaza. Both remain shut.
Mr Abuaassi said every day was getting ""more difficult"" as food supplies dwindled.
""Everyone is starving here, day by day, life is getting difficult and difficult,"" he continued.
""I don't know what's going to happen over the next two, three days.
""[But] we are better than other people. Some people can't even have somewhere to sleep, or some food or water.
""At least we are kind of safe. We're lucky we got a bit of food and water and somewhere to stay. It's a really difficult situation here.""
He urged the British Embassy to help, adding: ""I hope the British Embassy can do something for us to get out of Gaza as soon as possible.""

"Israel Gaza: Children must be off limits, says father of abducted kids",2023-11-01,BBC,By Jon Donnison,"In the garden of his home in central Israel, amid the palm trees dappled in the morning sun, Yoni Asher shows me a video on his phone.
It's of his two small girls, sitting on a bed. They're singing Happy Birthday.
Raz, the eldest, with long fair hair, is just four years old. Her sister Aviv, darker and more like her dad, is only two.
""They made this for my birthday in July,"" Yoni tells me.
But four months on, the 37-year-old father and husband is home alone.
Along with their mother Doron, they were captured on 7 October in Hamas's unprecedented cross border attack. They are thought to be among the youngest of the 240 hostages being held in Gaza.
""They had been visiting their grandma for the holidays in Nir Oz,"" Yoni says.
The Israeli kibbutz sits only two miles from Gaza. It was one of the communities worst affected by the attack, with one in four of those who lived there believed to have been killed or kidnapped by Hamas.
Yoni was not with his family that day. He'd stayed home for work, a hundred miles away.
The first confirmation his family had been abducted by Hamas came in a video, posted on TikTok from inside Gaza. Yoni shows it to me.
In the five-second clip, you can see his wife Doron, still in her nightwear crammed onto a motorised cart surrounded by Hamas gunmen.
Raz is there in a pink summer dress.
""That's Aviv's hand,"" Yoni says, pointing to five tiny fingers, reaching out towards her mother.
That was more than three weeks ago. Yoni has not seen or heard of his family since. Their grandma, Efrat Katz, has been found dead. Her partner, Gadi Mozes, also abducted, is missing.
""The only way to describe it is hell,"" says Yoni. ""It's the definition of hell.""
""How can I eat when I don't know what my family are eating? How can I sleep when I don't know if they if they are cold or too hot?""
""As a father, if you ever saw your children jumping on the bed, or the sofa, you worry they will fall on their head. So, imagine how I feel in this situation. Everything is frightening to me.""
For now, all Yoni has are memories. And inside the family home, they are everywhere. Photographs and children's artwork on the wall. Tiny handprints in red paint.
""They loved to draw. Raz did this one for me,"" says Yoni, pointing to a cartoon-like figure on a pin board that's meant to look like him.
""She told me it's a superhero.""
There's the familiar toy kitchen.
""They always liked to pretend to cook for me.""
Yoni goes on.
A collection of tiny shoes is lined up in the corner amid children's books.
""I had to take all the batteries out of the noisy toys,"" he says.
""They are tiny balls of energy. With three women in the house, we had enough noise for any man,"" Yoni tells me managing to raise a smile.
I ask him how he feels about the suffering in Gaza, now under Israeli bombardment for almost a month and where the United Nations says thousands of children have been killed or injured.
""Children are children, it doesn't matter which country they are from,"" he says.
""Children need to be off limits. I can't hate not even the children of my so-called enemies. How can you hate a child?""
And what about the hostage videos that have been released by Hamas?
""It was not easy to watch,"" Yoni replies.
""They're the ones who got kidnapped. They [Hamas] are taking advantage [of] them in a cynical and the lowest way possible, in order to make some kind of psychological battle.""
At 37 years old, Yoni has known the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians his entire life. His parents knew it before him.
But for him, 7 October is obviously the worst moment.
""It's one day of Holocaust,"" he tells me, as he pauses to choose his words.
""I know it's a harsh word. But that day was the worst that was seen in the history of the Jewish people and the Israeli people.""
Does he think Israel can ever get over its collective trauma?
""We have no other choice. It's like my own personal case. It's either fight or be dropped,"" he says.
""We have to recover. It will be very difficult. But I believe in the long term, our nation will recover.""
For now though, all Yoni can do is wait, hope and tell his family's story.

Anger at Israeli army probe into fatal shooting of Palestinian toddler,2023-06-15,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"The parents of a Palestinian toddler killed by an Israeli soldier say the military's investigation into his death ""makes a mockery of our son's blood"".
Mohammed Tamimi, two, was shot in the head and his father Haitham was injured in the occupied West Bank on 1 June.
The military's report blames a mix-up for a soldier firing at their car.
It says he thought he was shooting at gunmen and that the confusion was caused by another soldier firing in the air in violation of regulations.
Haitham Tamimi told the BBC: ""We, as the parents of Mohammed, consider that the army's statement makes a mockery of our son's blood, belittles the scale of the soldiers' crime and confirms that there is no force that deters them from killing us.""
He said that he hoped to take his son's case to international courts in the future and that he was working with the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din and other organisations.
""I know that no-one will punish the soldier who killed my son, but I want to expose them so that the suffering that happened to us won't happen to another family,"" Mr Tamimi said.
The Israeli military published the results of its investigation into the incident in the village of Nabi Saleh on Wednesday.
The report repeated the military's previous assertion that two Palestinian gunmen had fired at a Jewish settlement and an Israeli military post close to Nabi Saleh.
An army officer arrived at the scene and began searching the area, it said. He then saw a ""suspicious vehicle and fired several times into the air in violation of orders"".
This prompted a soldier stationed at the guard post who heard the shots to open fire on the Tamimis' car outside their home, according to the report. He believed the gunmen were using it to flee and had received permission from his commander.
A military helicopter was used to transport Mohammed Tamimi to an Israeli hospital, but he died of his injuries four days later.
His father was treated for a gunshot injury to the shoulder in Ramallah but was discharged just in time to visit his son before his death.
Mohammed Tamimi was the youngest child killed as a result of the Israel-Palestinian conflict this year.
The Israeli military investigation found fault with commanders for miscommunication and ""incorrect decision-making"", and said that the officer who fired in the air would be reprimanded for violating orders.
""We do everything that we can so as not to harm uninvolved civilians. I express my sorrow for the harm that was caused to civilians and the death of the toddler,"" the Commanding Officer of Israeli Central Command, Major General Yehuda Fox, stated.
The Palestinian foreign ministry, in a statement, deplored the findings as ""the clearest and ugliest form of disregard for, and legalisation of, the shedding of Palestinian blood"".
It has called for an international investigation into Israeli military actions against Palestinian children.
""Without accountability, Israel's crimes against our people/children will continue unabated,"" Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh wrote in a tweet last week. He visited the mourning tent of Mohammed Tamimi in Nabi Saleh.
The US Office for Palestinian Affairs urged Israel ""to evaluate all use of deadly force that involves civilian casualties"".
Similar statements calling on Israel to hold accountable those responsible for Mohammed Tamimi's death were made by the European Union delegation to the Palestinians and the United Nations envoy for the Middle East peace process.
The killing of the toddler came amid a surge in violence, particularly in the West Bank, in recent months.
A Yesh Din report based on military data from 2017 to 2021 found that Israeli soldiers were prosecuted over less than 1% of the hundreds of complaints filed against them on alleged offences against Palestinians.

BBC's Cardiff building graffitied during Palestine protest,2023-10-29,BBC,,"A woman has been charged after the word ""liars"" was daubed on BBC Wales' office during a pro-Palestine protest.
Demonstrators gathered at the Aneurin Bevan statue on Queen Street in Cardiff before heading down St Mary Street toward the BBC's office on Saturday.
One of the attendees called the protest ""fairly spontaneous"", saying it involved a number of different groups.
Cardiff University lecturer Joey Whitfield said the protesters wanted to see an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
Deidre Murphy, 69, from Swansea, has been charged with criminal damage and is due to appear at Cardiff Magistrates' Court on 14 November, South Wales Police said on Sunday.
The Cardiff demonstration was one of a numbertaking place across the UKand follows a recent upsurge in conflict between Hamas and Israel.
Israel has expanded its strikes,three weeks after Hamas launched a cross-border attackthat killed 1,400 people and saw 229 peoplekidnapped as hostages.
Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 7,500 Palestinians have been killed as Israel carried out retaliatory strikes.
Mr Whitfield said, roads were blocked before the demonstrators sat down in front of the BBC's building in Central Square.
He said names were held up of people killed in Gaza since bombing began and chants that called ""for a ceasefire, a free Palestine"".
Sammie, a Palestinian Jordanian who attended, said: ""This is not only a Palestinian issue, it is a human issue.""
The BBC declined to comment.

Labour stands with the people of Israel - David Lammy,2023-10-08,BBC,By Sam Francis,"Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has said Labour ""stands with the people of Israel"", following attacks by Hamas.
Speaking to a fringe event at the Labour conference, Mr Lammy said ""Israel has a right to self-defence against terrorism"".
Any response should be ""proportionate"" and ""within international law"", Mr Lammy added.
More than 600 Israelis have reportedly been killed in attacks from Gaza since Saturday.
Retaliatory Israeli air strikes have killed at least 370 people in the Gaza Strip, with 2,200 wounded, Palestinian officials say.
ABritish man serving with the Israeli military has been killedon the Gaza border, his family says.
Images of ""elderly people, children and women being taken, being shot, some being held as hostages is deeply, deeply worrying,"" Mr Lammy said.
If a similar attack had happened in the UK ""we would be approaching that on a war footing"", he said.
""It would be incredibly serious we would do what we thought it took, within international law.""
Later, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his thoughts were with the family of the British man Nathanel Young ""and with all those whose families and communities have been touched by this terrible violence"".
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.
He said: ""I want to express my absolute solidarity for the people of Israel now is not a time for equivocation, and I'm unequivocal. Hamas, and the people who support Hamas, are fully responsible for this appalling act of terror, for the murder of civilians and for the kidnapping of innocent people, including children.""
Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to condemn Hamas at a left-wing event held outside the Labour Party conference.
Mr Corbyn said he did not ""support any attacks"", but in a tetchy exchange with journalists declined to set out his view on Hamas despite being repeatedly asked whether he would condemn the group.
Mr Corbyn said he wanted ""peace, a ceasefire and a process that ends the Israeli occupation of Palestine"".
The former leader is sitting as an independent MP after being removed from Labour's parliamentary party over his response to a report on antisemitism under his leadership. He remains a party member.
Under Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party increasingly supported Palestinian movements and criticised Israeli policies.
During the 2018 Labour conference,hundreds of members unfurled Palestinian flagsand chanted slogans during a debate on a motion aimed at showing support for Palestinian people.
Speaking at the Labour conference Mr Lammy reminded members that ""Hamas is a proscribed terrorist organisation"" in the UK.
Labour's official position is to support a two-state solution respecting ""sovereignty of Israel and the dignity and human rights of Palestinians,"" Mr Lammy said.
Mr Lammy's comments came after an interview given by Sir Keir toSunday with Laura Kuenssberg.
Sir Keir described the rocket fire and incursions from Gaza as an ""appalling terrorist attack"", saying Israel has ""every right to defend herself"".

Israel-Gaza: Shaky start to ceasefire ending five days of fighting,2023-05-13,BBC,By David Gritten,"There are hopes a ceasefire will take hold to end five days of fighting between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) militants in Gaza.
It got off to a shaky start, as both sides kept firing for two hours after the truce started on Saturday evening.
At least 33 Palestinians have been killed since Tuesday in Gaza, where Israel says it has struck PIJ targets.
Palestinian rocket fire into Israel has killed two people, one Israeli and one Palestinian working in the country.
The mediation efforts were led by Egypt, which urged both sides to adhere to the ceasefire agreement.
Washington welcomed the announcement of the ceasefire, and said US officials had worked with regional partners to achieve the resolution.
Barrages of Palestinian rockets set off warning sirens in southern Israel, close to Gaza, and the suburbs of the city of Tel Aviv just before the truce was due to come into effect at 22:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Saturday.
Minutes after it supposedly started, militants launched more rockets at southern Israeli communities and the Israeli military carried out air strikes on what it said were two PIJ rocket launchers in Gaza.
Further rocket fire at around 23:00 drew another round of air strikes.
Despite the fighting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement confirming that a ceasefire had been agreed and thanked Egypt for its ""intensive efforts"" to secure one.
It also said Israel had made clear that its acceptance meant ""quiet will be met with quiet, and that if Israel is attacked or threatened, it will continue to do everything that it needs to in order to defend itself"".
PIJ also confirmed the ceasefire, with a spokesman telling Reuters news agency: ""We will abide by it as long as the occupation [Israel] abides by it.""
According to a text from Egyptian intelligence seen by the BBC, Palestinian militants and Israel have agreed to stop actions targeting civilians and other individuals.
The BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says this form of wording appears to cover both the recent intense rocket fire from Gaza and Israel's controversial policy of targeted killings of militant leaders.
Israel began its military operation in Gaza before dawn on Tuesday, killing three leaders of PIJ in their homes as well as at least 10 civilians, including relatives and neighbours of the men.
PIJ fighters then fired barrages of rockets at southern and central Israel, which they said were intended to avenge the dead.
At least 1,234 rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza in total, with 976 crossing into Israeli territory, according to the Israeli military. Most have been intercepted or have landed in open areas, but some have hit homes and other buildings.
One woman was killed when a rocket hit an apartment building in the central city of Rehovot on Thursday, while a worker from Gaza was killed when he was hit by rocket shrapnel at a building site in the southern Sdot Negev region.
The military says 221 of the rockets have fallen short inside Gaza and that they have killed four people there, including three children. Islamic Jihad denies the allegation.
Israel has carried out air strikes on 371 PIJ targets across Gaza, killing three more leaders and destroying what it said were the group's rocket launch sites and command centres.
About half of the 33 people killed in Gaza were civilians, including seven children and four women, according to local health officials.

Palestinian Americans trapped in Gaza wait desperately to leave,,BBC,By Sam Cabral,"Almost a month since the war broke out, Folla Saqer and her two children are still trapped in Gaza.
Her husband, Ramiz Younis, is anxiously waiting for news that they have finally got out.
The children - Zain, two, and Zaina, nine months - are American citizens. Along with Ms Saqer, a permanent legal resident, they are among roughly 1,000 people waiting to cross into neighbouring Egypt and begin their return to the US.
The children are on a list published by Gaza's border authority approved to leave the enclave on Thursday, along with some 500 other foreigners, including 400 Americans.
Ms Saqer - whose name is not on the list - attempted to pass through the Rafah crossing on Thursday morning but was denied, according to Justin Eisele, a lawyer for the family.
He said no reason was provided, but ""based on comparing notes with other people"", her immigration status - a permanent resident, but not a citizen -  ""seems to be the distinction"".
Since Wednesday, foreign passport holders and injured Gazans have been allowed through the Rafah crossing for the first time since the war began.
But the US State Department has struggled to provide specifics on its processes for getting people out, and critics allege that government officials have been haphazard and vague in their correspondence.
It is all stoking growing frustration among some Palestinian Americans as they, or their families, scramble to get out of Gaza.
According to Mr Eisele, Ms Saqer was never made aware until her visit to the border that she - as a green card holder - would be unable to cross into Egypt.
When her passage was barred, ""she elected to not hand her babies to a stranger"", he told the BBC.
""Before we give Israel $15bn, could we take a minute to organise a mother crossing the border with her children?"" he asked. ""You can ship rockets that can level a building but you can't organise a simple border crossing with two of our allegedly strongest allies?""
In a statement to the BBC, the State Department declined to say why Ms Saqer was unable to pass through the Rafah crossing.
""The Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas. It has been a top priority for us to get Rafah open not just for trucks coming in, but for US citizens and other foreign nationals coming out,"" a spokesperson said.
""We expect exits to continue over the next several days. We will not stop working to get US citizens and their family members out as safely as possible.""
So desperate is Mr Younis to have his wife and children back home that, on Monday, the 51-year-old filed a federal lawsuit accusing the US government of discrimination and failure to do its duty towards its citizens.
The legal action, which names Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin as defendants, alleges the family has been ""let down and ignored as if we are second-class citizens"".
The Gaza-born Mr Younis returned to the enclave four years ago after marrying Ms Saqer. The couple resettled in Baltimore, Maryland, last year.
Feeling homesick, Ms Saqer took the children to Gaza on a short trip earlier this year. She intended to come back in mid-October, by which time Mr Younis had completed their move to Little Rock, Arkansas.
When the conflict erupted, Mr Younis immediately urged her to travel to the Egyptian border and wait for an opportunity to cross.
In those first three days, he said, he didn't contact the State Department: ""The crossing was open and I thought I can do this on my own,"" he said.
Ms Saqer took the children to her sister's place in Rafah, a 10-minute drive from the border. But the first time she attempted to leave, the waiting area by the crossing was bombed. In the frantic rush for cover, she left all their luggage behind.
With the crossing closed, Mr Younis provided his family's information to the State Department. He received an email on 14 October with instructions that the crossing would open for five hours the next day.
Ms Saqer and the children again went and waited, but they were not let through.
Similar updates, including from local US embassies, would follow in the ensuing days, urging Ms Saqer to go to the border. She made four more trips.
""Whenever we have the chance to communicate, my wife asks me for news [from the government],"" said Mr Younis.
""Sometimes I don't have news, but I keep the hope alive. I need to keep the hope alive even if there is nothing happening.""
The Okals, a suburban Massachusetts family who have been trapped in Gaza, are on the list of foreigners approved to leave the territory on Thursday.
Abood Okal and Wafaa Abuzayda took their one-year-old son, Yousef, to the enclave last month to visit the grandparents he had never met.
The family shared meals, went to the beach and rode horses together - until Hamas launched its attack on Israel six days before the Okals' intended departure.
From Ms Abuzayda's home in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, the trio heeded Israeli warnings and fled south. Nobody knows if their home - which is located very close to a refugee camp bombed on Tuesday - is still standing.
For nearly three weeks, the trio have stayed in a single-family home in Rafah with 40 other people, waiting for an opportunity to cross into Egypt.
Every single day, they have contacted the State Department, as well as US embassies in Cairo and Jerusalem, according to Sammy Nabulsi, a family friend.
On four separate occasions, they were advised to go to the Rafah crossing, waiting up to eight hours to cross.
""Their circumstances right now are completely dire and dangerous,"" said Mr Nabulsi on Wednesday.
The 40-person house has lost running water and fuel, he told the BBC. Its residents are limiting the number of times they flush the toilets and with no cooking oil on hand, the family is largely living off canned tuna and fava beans.
Their last visit to the bakery lasted six hours and their last water run yielded only a few litres for the whole house to share.
Worst of all, Yousef often wakes up screaming inconsolably from night terrors and cannot go back to sleep.
""That poor kid is just completely traumatised,"" said Mr Nabulsi, adding that Yousef's parents have run out of milk for him to drink.
Mr Okal, who holds a PhD in cancer research, is a director at the Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company. Ms Abuzayda worked at a local non-profit and now cares for their son.
""They're just the kindest people. They're really funny and sweet,"" Mr Nabulsi said.
""They live in Massachusetts. They should be in Massachusetts.""

US condemns Israeli minister Ben Gvir's 'inflammatory' Palestinian comments,2023-08-25,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"The US has condemned Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir for claiming his rights in the occupied West Bank are more important than those of Palestinians.
The state department said it strongly condemned the ""inflammatory comments"" and ""all racist rhetoric"".
His remarks on Israeli TV sparked a storm of criticism online.
Mr Ben Gvir has since called the coverage ""fake news"" and attacked the ""radical left"" for ""misquoting"" him.
On X, the platform previously known as Twitter, Mr Ben Gvir on Friday also launched a scathing attack on the Palestinian-American model Bella Hadid for reposting a clip of his comments, calling her an ""Israel hater"" who made him look ""racist and dark"".
Ms Hadid had reposted the video on Instagram where she has 60 million followers, adding the comment: ""In no place, no time… should one life be more valuable than another's.""
Mr Ben Gvir leads the ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit or ""Jewish Power"" party which espouses racist, anti-Arab policies. He has previous convictions for inciting racism and supporting terrorism.
In December he was made a top minister by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who gave him a seat in his security cabinet and put him in charge of the domestic police, as well as Israel's militarised border police force that operates in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
His comments on Wednesday came amid spiralling violence in which Palestinian gunmen killed three Israelis in separate attacks, including one close to the West Bank city of Hebron, where Mr Ben Gvir lives in a Jewish settlement.
It led to even further restrictions on movement for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces searched for the gunmen.
""My right, my wife's, my children's, to roam the roads of Judea and Samaria are more important than the right of movement of the Arabs,"" said Mr Ben Gvir, using a biblical term for the West Bank.
He then addressed Mohammad Magadli, an Arab Israeli journalist in the studio, saying: ""Sorry Mohammad, but this is the reality, that's the truth. My right for life comes before their right to movement.""
A video clip of the comments went viral online and sparked a backlash, including from Palestinians and Israeli opposition figures.
The Palestinian Authority leadership condemned ""in the strongest terms the racist and heinous remarks by Israel's fascist minister Itamar Ben Gvir, which only confirms Israel's apartheid regime of Jewish supremacy and racial terror against the Palestinian people"".
It called for Mr Ben Gvir and other Israeli officials to be ""sanctioned and held accountable"".
Karine Elharrar, an Israeli MP in the opposition Yesh Atid party, described the minister as ""the authentic representative of the most racist, messianic and Kahanist government we've ever had"".
Mr Ben Gvir's political background lies in Kahanism - a violently racist movement that supports the expulsion of Palestinians from their lands.
Pressed by Israeli journalists for a response, a US state department spokesman on Thursday night said: ""We strongly condemn Israeli minister Ben Gvir's inflammatory comments on the freedom of movement of Palestinian residents in the West Bank.""
""We condemn all racist rhetoric; as such messages are particularly damaging when amplified by those in leadership positions and are incongruent with advancing respect for human rights for all.""
Later on Friday, the EU also ""strongly condemned"" Mr Ben Gvir's comments, saying ""the values of democracy and respect for human rights stand central to the EU-Israel partnership, including as regards the people living under occupation in the Palestinian territory"".
Palestinians in the West Bank already endure severe restrictions on the right to movement, including being unable without permits to freely travel to Jerusalem or their ancestral lands inside Israel. The Israeli authorities say this is done for security reasons.
Parties representing Arab Israelis, or Palestinian citizens of Israel, as well as Israeli anti-occupation groups condemned Mr Ben Gvir but argued that he was simply articulating longstanding realities in the West Bank.
Addressing the US state department response, Arab Israeli MP Ahmed Tibi said: ""Ben Gvir… described bluntly, as a top Israeli minister, the general and sweeping Israeli policy since 1967. Why are you crying out following the description of racist apartheid reality, and not… the reality as it is?""
B'tselem, an Israeli non-governmental organisation which provides support for Palestinians living under Israel's military occupation, said: ""This is the reality we see on the ground, every day, for five decades. The rights of the Jews are more important than the rights of the Arabs, this is what apartheid looks like.""
In a likely nod to the global response to his comments, Mr Ben Gvir posted a statement in English on Thursday blaming the ""Israeli radical left"" for ""selectively"" misquoting him.
He said: ""This is how fake news is spread: I said yesterday on a TV broadcast that the right of Jews to live and not be murdered in terror attacks prevails over the right of Arabs in Judea and Samaria to travel on the roads without security restrictions. That is why checkpoints should be placed on roads where regular terrorism and shooting by jihadists are committed against Jews.""
""This is exactly how the Left continues to fan the flames of incitement in the world against the Israeli government,"" he added.
Mr Netanyahu's office issued a statement on Friday evening, in a likely attempt to limit the diplomatic damage, trying to clarify the comments.
It said: ""In order to prevent these heinous murders, Israel's security forces have implemented special security measures in these areas [of the West Bank]. This is what Minister Ben Gvir meant when he said 'the right to life precedes freedom of movement'.""
Following Monday's attack, Israeli forces set up checkpoints at entrances and exits to Hebron where they were questioning Palestinians, while they searched forthe gunmen who shot dead Batsheva Nigri, a 40-year-old nursery teacher and mother of three who lived in a nearby settlement.
On the same day,a Palestinian man was critically injured after being shot in the headby Israeli forces in a village near Nablus. Video appeared to show him unarmed and running towards an injured person before being hit by a single shot.
Last week, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy was left seriously wounded after being shot in the head by Israeli forces in East Jerusalem. Police alleged he had tried to throw a petrol bomb at them during a raid.
The same day video showed an apparently unarmed Palestinian man said to suffer from mental health problems being shot and wounded by Israeli troops during a protest near Israel's separation barrier in Qalqilya.

"British Jews are 'full of fear, like I've never seen before'",2023-10-31,BBC,By Aleem Maqbool,"""The Jewish community at the moment is full of dread, full of fear, like I've never seen before,"" says Justin Cohen, news editor and co-publisher of Jewish News.
He talks of this anxiety playing out with a backdrop of intense trauma caused by the Hamas killings and kidnappings on 7 October.
More than 70% of British Jews have family living in Israel and 90% have visited the country at least once, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research.
But the fact the Metropolitan Police reported a 15-fold increase in antisemitic incidents over the past three weeks, when compared with the same period last year, means hatred has been at the forefront of the minds of many.
""If people who are so boiling over with rage in these demos see Jewish people as inextricably linked with Israel, they will inevitably target those Jewish people. The fears are never-ending at this point,"" says Mr Cohen.
The demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling.
In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for ""intifada"", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings.
""We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,"" says Mr Cohen
Although protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches.
""It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,"" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.
In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bellwrote a blog post that went viralin which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.
Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation.
""Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,"" he says.
Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.
Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel.
""The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,"" he says.
It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.
The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to ""the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice"".
Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic.
""There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity,"" says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.
The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews.
Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance.
""It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful,"" Mr Sayle says.
Referring to the ""river to the sea"" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region.
But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country.
""I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,"" Mr Sayle says.
""But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven,"" he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.
While there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021.
""We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,"" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.
Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way.
""Everybody's very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,"" Mr Schechter says.
There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.

Northamptonshire woman tells of fears for relatives in Israel,,BBC,,"A woman who has relatives in Israel says she fears for her family as the ""terrifying"" conflict unfolds.
Susan, who lives in Northamptonshire, lived in Israel for many years but said the current situation was ""totally different from anything we've known"".
She said her grandchildren were ""being kept safe in sealed rooms"".
The UK Government said it was working to organise flights for UK nationals who wish to leave the country.
Susan,speaking to BBC Radio Northampton, met her husband in Israel and has three children - as well as two stepchildren who live in Israel.
She said the last few days had been causing the family distress.
""We are in touch with the family every day [but] we have to be very careful, we have to bite our tongues and not say anything,"" she said.
""That's the most frustrating thing: scurrying away into our corner, keeping our heads down, when everybody is saying what they want to say.
""We're warned not to do that.""
She said her grandchildren were not in school and were being kept safe in sealed rooms, where they can hear everything that is going on outside.
Every communication she gets from Israel, she says, sets her mind racing.
""I got a text message at 06:30 from an American friend who lives in Israel and my stomach literally went over before I'd read it,"" she said.
""She said 'It's started, we've had 600 bombs coming over and the terrorists have infiltrated our streets and our homes', and that's what's terrifying.""
Susan said she considered arranging for her Israeli relatives to come to the UK, but she does not think they would want to leave, adding: ""Israelis won't do that, they will stay put to heal themselves and get over it.""
""The worst thing is three o'clock in the morning when you start to think of the worst things and you try to stop your mind going completely crazy,"" she said.

"Lianne, Noiya and Yahel Sharabi: Funeral held for mother and daughters killed by Hamas",2023-10-25,BBC,By Lucy Manning,"It is the saddest of sights.
Opposite the pomegranate trees in a quiet corner so at odds with the manner of their death, three graves have been dug for a mother and her daughters: Lianne, Noiya and Yahel Sharabi.
A family Hamas tried to obliterate.
The contrast between this scene and a photo of smiling mum Lianne with her arms around her two teenage daughters, taken just a few months ago as they celebrated on Kibbutz Be'eri, in southern Israel, could not be starker.
They cannot even return home in death. Be'eri has been destroyed - the scene of a massacre. Too many are dead, yet the living cannot bury their dead there.
So this British-Israeli family is being buried in a cemetery about 25 miles (40km) from the Gaza border.
The Sharabis cannot even rest in peace. The girls' dad Eli is still missing. Their uncle Yosi has been kidnapped. Here children can't mourn their parents. Parents can't grieve their children.
In Israel, hundreds of people gathered for their funeral with many wearing T-shirts that read: ""Lianne, Noiya and Yahel have been murdered. Bring back Eli and Yosi now.""
Teenage girls cried for their friends Yahel and Noiya, unable to comprehend what has happened to this family.
Dead, missing, kidnapped. The horror of that day, for this country, in one family.
Lianne came to Israel from Bristol aged just 19 to work on a kibbutz. She then built her life here until Hamas decided to take that from her and her daughters.
She was a caring mother, wife, daughter and sister, with a dry sense of humour.
Her 13-year-old daughter, Yahel, was a bundle of energy, full of adventure and mischief.
And Noiya, 16, was a gifted student, sensitive and fun.
Their lives are now encapsulated in just a few words.
""Our entire world is broken"", their uncle said.
Lianne's family and friends in Bristol have been unable to travel here but said they would watch the funeral in the UK ""united in grief"".
They remembered Yahel for her sense of adventure, riding her bike at ""breakneck speed around the kibbutz"" and for dancing along to TikTok videos with her sister and, on occasions, her British cousins.
Her family in the UK said they were left with ""a Yahel-shaped hole in our lives that can never be filled"".
Noiya was described as a ""beautiful and talented young woman"" who was ""always the big sister"".
""A beacon of light extinguished too soon,"" her family said in her eulogy.
Lianne, the third of four siblings, was described as ""unique, rare, special"".
Her brother Steve described her as ""big in every way - her love, her personality, her attitude and her mouth"".
In a eulogy, her mother Gill said she had a dry sense of humour - ""sometimes irreverent, but never malicious"".
""We will miss our girl to the end of our days and keep her in our hearts forever, tucked away with the fondest memories of her 48 years,"" she said.

US moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack,2023-10-09,BBC,By Gareth Evans in London & Barbara Plett Usher in Washington,"The US says it is moving an aircraft carrier, ships and jets to the eastern Mediterranean and will also give Israel additional equipment and ammunition.
It follows the Hamas attack on southern Israel, which President Biden called an ""unprecedented and appalling assault"".
A US National Security spokesperson said several US citizens were among the dead.
Israel says more than 700 people have been killed and 100 kidnapped.
In Gaza, more than 400 people have been killed following retaliatory Israeli air strikes, according to Palestinian officials.
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, a missile cruiser and four missile destroyers were heading to the region. He said fighter jets would also be sent.
Further military aid to Israel would be sent in the coming days, the White House said, adding that the US was working to ensure Israel's enemies did not try to seek advantage from the situation.
The large deployment reflects American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.
In particular, the US is eager to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the conflict. It is backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.
Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi has expressed support for the Hamas attack, saying Israel needed to be held to account for endangering the region.
Hamas has said assistance from Iran helped it carry out its attack, which involved rockets, drones and militants on paragliders and saw hundreds of fighters break through Israeli border fortifications around the Gaza Strip.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had not seen evidence of direct Iranian involvement, but that Iran had been helping the Gaza-based group for years.
""Hamas wouldn't be Hamas without the support that it's gotten over many years from Iran. We haven't yet seen direct evidence that Iran was behind this particular attack or involved. But the support over many years is clear,"" he told US TV.
At a UN Security Council meeting, Iran denied involvement in the attack on Israel.
Hundreds of people are still reported missing. Among them is 23-year-old American-Israeli Hersh Golberg-Polin, who was ata music festival in the desert which was stormed by militants.
His parentstold the Jerusalem Postthey received two messages from him reading: ""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry.""
Reports have started to emerge of other missing North Americans too, including peace activist Vivian Silver.
A friend of the 75-year-old Canadian toldThe Canadian Jewish Newsthat Ms Silver had called her sister on Saturday morning to say Palestinian militants were at her door.
""There was screaming and yelling and Vivian was fighting and then the phone went dead,"" he said.
Israel's ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog, told CBS News that he understood Americans were among the soldiers and civilians abducted in southern Israel but did not have details.
The US sends billions of dollars of military aid to Israel, a close ally, each year. Since World War Two, Israel has been thelargest overall recipient of US foreign aid.
The UN Security Council is due to meet in New York shortly to discuss the violence in Israel and Gaza.

West Bank: Two Israelis killed in suspected Palestinian shooting near Hawara,,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"An Israeli father and son have been killed in a suspected Palestinian shooting attack in the occupied West Bank.
It happened near the village of Hawara - which has been the scene of previousdeadly attacks on Israelisandrampages by Jewish settlers in retribution.
The shooting took place at a carwash.
The gunman is said to have approached on foot and opened fire with a handgun.
The Israeli ambulance service said the two men aged 28 and 60 were pronounced dead at the scene. Both are said to have been civilians from Ashdod in southern Israel.
Israeli media reported that they had come to the West Bank to fix their car and spent several hours in Hawara.
They say that the attacker spoke to them briefly - maybe to check if they were Jewish Israelis - before shooting them at point blank range.
The weapon was apparently found in a nearby field, and the suspect is still thought to be in the area.
The Israeli military has set up blockades nearby and is hunting for the gunman. It is also said to be on alert for reprisal attacks.
The Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad praised the deadly shooting.
Hawara has long been a flashpoint in the West Bank. It is located on a main road south of Nablus, which is mostly used by Palestinians and Israeli settlers.
In the past, Israelis would sometimes shop there and come for services, which are often cheaper in Palestinian areas of the West Bank. But that has become uncommon after a recent surge in violence.
This year, the village has seen several shooting attacks in which Israeli settlers and soldiers have been targeted - including the killing of two brothers in February.
That triggered a deadly rampage by a large crowd of settlers in one of the worst such acts in years. There have also been other instances of settler violence.

US says Israel to begin daily four-hour military pauses in Gaza,2023-11-09,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israel will begin to implement daily four-hour military pauses in areas of northern Gaza, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.
However Israel's defence minister stressed they were only ""localised and pinpoint measures"" that would ""not detract from the war fighting"".
President Biden said there would be two ""humanitarian passages"" allowing people to leave areas of fighting.
On Thursday heavy fighting was reported around two big hospitals in Gaza City.
Meanwhile, pictures once again showed thousands of Palestinians fleeing south from the city and other northern areas.
Mr Biden also said the US was trying to increase humanitarian supplies and assistance to Gaza. He said he was aiming for 150 trucks of aid per day to enter the territory.
However the UN said the amount of aid entering Gaza was only meeting ""a fraction"" of people's needs and the humanitarian situation was ""intolerable"". A conference in Paris earlier heard repeated appeals for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Israel has been bombarding Gaza for over a month and began a major ground offensive almost two weeks ago with the objective of destroying Hamas, which it, the US and other Western powers consider a terrorist organisation.
The war began after an unprecedented cross-border assault on southern Israel by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 10,800 people have been killed in the territory since then, while 1.5 million have fled their homes.
Mr Biden said Israel was ""fighting an enemy embedded in the civilian population, which places innocent Palestinian people at risk"" but that Israel had ""an obligation to distinguish between terrorists and civilians and fully comply with international law"".
On Thursday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had raided Hamas's ""military quarter"" near Al-Shifa Hospital and killed 50 ""terrorists"".
A witness said he had also seen tanks opening fire near Al-Quds Hospital.
About 2,000 patients and 50,000 displaced people are said to be inside Al-Shifa Hospital, which is located in Gaza City's northern Rimal neighbourhood and is the largest medical complex in Gaza.
Its director, Mohammed Abu Selmia,told the Associated Pressthat Israeli troops were about 3km (2 miles) away and that conditions there were ""disastrous in every sense of the word"".
In footage filmed inside the hospital on Thursday, a man who was accompanied by two children tells a journalist that they had been walking on a street, trying to flee south, when an Israeli tank opened fire at them.
""The remains of seven or eight martyrs were left at the scene,"" he says.
An unverified video posted on social media overnight also purportedly showed a number of people being helped after being hit by shrapnel from a shell on a street close to Al-Shifa.
The IDF has previously alleged that Hamas is also operating underground command centres beneath Al-Shifa itself. Hamas and hospital staff have denied the accusation.
Fierce battles were also reported on Thursday around Al-Quds hospital, which is 2.3km (1.4 miles) to the south-west in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood.
Hamouda Musa, 34, told the BBC he and his neighbour had escaped from a building opposite the hospital after he saw four tanks and a bulldozer advancing from the coast, 1km away to the north.
""They were firing intensely towards a nearby residential building,"" he said. ""We fled under a barrage of bullets via a back street. We miraculously came back from the dead.""
On Wednesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said that areas in close proximity were struck, injuring patients and displaced people, and damaging buildings.
The hospital also said on Wednesday that its main generator had been shut down because of a shortage of fuel, forcing it to close its surgical ward, oxygen generation plant and MRI ward.
The clashes and strikes in the north, as well as the struggle to secure enough drinking water and food to survive, has prompted some of the several hundred thousands of civilians staying there to flee southwards in recent days.
Pictures from drones showed a stream of people walking along Salah al-Din Road and crossing the Wadi Gaza river, after the IDF opened the route for a sixth consecutive day.
An estimated 50,000 people fled the north on Wednesday, which was 10 times more than on Monday.
Although the IDF has ordered civilians to move south of Wadi Gaza for their own safety, it has continued to carry out strikes on what it says are Hamas targets in areas where hundreds of thousands have sought refuge.
The Hamas-run interior ministry in Gaza said 12 people had been killed and many more injured in an Israeli air strike on a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the IDF.
While visiting Egypt's Rafah Crossing with Gaza on Wednesday, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said both sides in the conflict had committed war crimes.
""The atrocities perpetrated by Palestinian armed groups on 7 October were heinous, they were war crimes - as is the continued holding of hostages.""
""The collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians amounts also to a war crime, as does the unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians. The massive bombardments by Israel have killed, maimed and injured in particular women and children,"" he added.
Israel has insisted it has been acting in complete compliance with international law and that it has done everything possible to minimise civilian casualties.
It has also rejected the UN's warnings of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, arguing that there is sufficient food, water and fuel despite the ""complete siege"" it imposed in response to Hamas's attack, and has rejected its calls for a ceasefire unless the hostages are released.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, told the Paris conference on Gaza that there had to be a ceasefire so that more aid could be delivered.
He called the volume currently coming through Rafah ""blatantly inadequate"".
A total of 756 lorries have crossed from Egypt since 21 October. Before the war, an average of 500 lorry loads entered Gaza every working day from Egypt and Israel.

Israeli archaeologists help find remains of Hamas attack victims,2023-11-07,BBC,By David Gritten,"Archaeologists have been enlisted to help Israel's military identify the remains of some of the 1,400 people killed in Hamas's attack a month ago.
They have been combing through and sieving the ash from burnt houses in which families from Kibbutz Be'eri, Kfar Aza and Nir Oz were murdered, the Israel Antiquities Authority says.
They have also been checking burnt cars at a festival site where hundreds died.
The IAA says the remains of at least 10 missing people have so far been found.
Some of them have since been buried, while other evidence has been brought for further examination at the Shura military base in central Israel.
On 7 October, an estimated 1,500 Hamas gunmen breached the Gaza perimeter fence under a barrage of rockets and then systematically attacked anyone they came across at nearby southern Israeli communities and military posts, as well as the outdoor Supernova music festival.
The UN says the names of 1,159 Israelis and foreign nationals who were killed, including 828 civilians, have so far been released by Israeli authorities. Of those whose ages have been provided, 31 were children.
Another 242 people, including about 30 children, were taken hostage.
The Israel Antiquities Authority said in a statement on Tuesday that its archaeologists had been asked by Colonel Yossi Cohen of the Israeli military's Gaza Division two weeks ago to help search for missing people in houses and cars that were incinerated in the attack.
""The archaeological methods employed at ancient sites are similar to the methods applied here,"" it cited the archaeologists as saying.
""But it is one thing to expose 2,000-year-old destruction remains, and quite another thing - heart-rending and unfathomable - to carry out the present task searching for evidence of our sisters and brothers in the settlements.""
A video posted online by the IAAshowed a team of archaeologists and soldiers inside several destroyed houses in Kibbutz Be'eri.
They are seen carefully inspecting ash and other charred debris on the floor with trowels and removing personal items from a sieve.
""I believe and hope that we found the missing father,"" one of archaeologists is heard saying.
""In the same house, we found several bodies of terrorists together with their weapons,"" he adds. ""There was a lot of blood, shocking things that shouldn't be described here.""
Another archaeologist vows: ""We will continue until we get to the last burnt house and we know that we have found everyone we possibly can.""

Israeli military failing to investigate journalists’ deaths - report,2023-05-09,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"Israeli forces have killed at least 20 journalists since 2001 in cases showing a pattern of ""inadequate responses that evade accountability"", a watchdog says.
A report by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) describes routine obfuscation and failure to properly investigate by the Israeli military.
It says the journalists' deaths and insufficient responses constitute a ""grave threat to press freedom"".
It comes ahead of the first anniversary of the killing of Shireen Abu Aqla.
The Palestinian-American Al Jazeera correspondent was shot dead during an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank on 11 May 2022.
The vast majority of the journalists killed in the last two decades were Palestinian.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in response to the report that its forces did not target journalists, who through their work were often present near ""violent riots"" or ""shooting attacks"" towards Israeli forces or civilians
""During intense combat situations, the IDF only strikes at military targets and takes all possible precautions in order to reduce harm to civilians during its operational activities,"" it added.
The IDF also said that it ""regularly examines and investigates its actions through independent and in-depth inspection and investigation mechanisms"".
The CPJ report details around two thirds of what it says are at least 20 cases of correspondents, camera operators, producers or other media workers killed by Israeli military fire since 2001.
In the case of Abu Aqla, who was shot in the head during an IDF raid in Jenin refugee camp, the report notes that ""to date no-one has been held accountable"", adding that her killing ""was not an isolated event"".
Since 2001, 18 Palestinians and two European foreign journalists - one Italian and one British - have been killed by Israeli military fire and no-one has ever been charged or held to account, the report says.
""The degree to which Israel claims to investigate journalist killings depends largely on external pressure,"" says Sherif Mansour, CPJ's Middle East co-ordinator.
""There are cursory probes into the deaths of journalists with foreign passports, but that is rarely the case for slain Palestinian reporters. Ultimately, none has seen any semblance of justice,"" he adds.
Israel maintains it has robust processes for investigating the actions of its forces.
Since 2014, it has operated a system of ""fact finding assessments"" into civilian deaths, which can progress to a criminal investigation by the Military Advocate General.
But in the nine years since the system has been in place, no case involving the death of a journalist has reached criminal proceedings and no soldier has been held accountable, the report says.
Among other cases highlighted in the report are those of Palestinian video journalist Yaser Murtaja and freelance reporter Ahmed Abu Hussein, both of whom were shot dead by Israeli snipers in separate incidents while they covered Palestinian protests at the Gaza perimeter fence in 2018.
The Palestinian journalists' union at the time accused Israel of ""deliberately"" targeting them.
The Israeli military told the report that the two journalists were ""allegedly present at the scene of violent riots"" and ""no suspicion was found which would justify the opening of a criminal investigation"" into the soldiers.
In the case of Murtaja, the CPJ report says Israel's then-defence minister Avigdor Liberman spent weeks ""trying to discredit the journalist"" by saying he was a senior member of the armed wing of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, without presenting any evidence.
It later emerged that the journalist had been vetted by the US to receive international development funding for his production company.
In the case of Abu Hussein, human rights campaigners filed a request for the military to investigate his death.
But the CPJ report says the IDF closed the case two years later without interviewing any witnesses, saying there was no criminal intent by the soldiers.
Abu Hussein's mother Raja said the military never contacted her about its probe. ""The typical answer the Israeli army gives when it kills civilians is that the army did nothing wrong,"" she told the report's authors.
""I wish I could meet the guy who killed my son... I would ask him, 'Why, why did you target my son?' I think he won't have an answer. He is a sniper, he kills,"" she said.
Under international law, the use of firearms by security forces against civilians is defined as a measure of last resort, and can only take place to stop an ""imminent threat of death or serious injury"".
The IDF routinely responds to cases of civilians hit, including journalists, by saying that soldiers use lethal force to stop rioting or amid fire aimed at them by Palestinian militants.
The CPJ report describes a ""pattern"" of evading accountability by the IDF and other officials including discounting evidence and witness claims, pushing false narratives, accusing journalists of terrorism and opening probes only under international pressure.
The IDF has previously said it was ""highly probable"" its soldiers fired the shot that killed Shireen Abu Aqla, but described it as ""unintentional"" - a claim disputed by her family.
The IDF said its enforcement policy regarding deaths during operational activity has been approved by several Supreme Court rulings.
Shlomo Zipori, a former chief defence attorney in the Military Advocate General's unit, told the report that soldiers may overthink their moves in the field if they fear being tried.
""I represented a soldier who was still serving in the army while under criminal investigation for killing a Palestinian and injuring another,"" he said.
""Someone threw a Molotov cocktail at him and he didn't respond because he was so traumatised by the interrogations he went through in the hands of the military police,"" he added.

Israeli music festival: Londoner's son fled militant attack,2023-10-09,BBC,By Guy Lynn and James W Kelly,"A surgeon from north-west London has said his son is ""happy to be alive"" after he fled a concert in southern Israel which was targeted by Palestinian militants.
Elliot Sorene, who lives in Mill Hill, told BBC London his son Ariel witnessed people being killed and kidnapped.
More than 260 bodies have beenfound at the Supernova festival site.
Mr Sorene said Ariel was not physically injured but one of his friends was killed and two more were hurt.
""He is happy to be alive but he's upset about what he saw and feels for those who have been killed, and taken hostage,"" he said.
Mr Sorene said Ariel, 22, was at a trance party when they heard ""rockets land nearby"".
He said his son and his friends ""saw terrorists with automatic weapons start to kill all of the security guards and indiscriminately shoot at the partygoers"".
Mr Sorene said Ariel, who has dual Israeli-British citizenship, managed to run to his Renault Clio but the militants then began firing on his vehicle.
Ariel and some of his friends managed to escape through a field and ran about 12 miles (20km) to a nearby community to find safety.
The Israeli military suggests dozens of people, among them foreign nationals, have been taken as captives from the festival as well as from border towns and villages into Gaza.
Noam Sagi said his 74-year-old mother Ada Sagi wasamong those believed to have been kidnappedby the militant group Hamas.
Mr Sagi, who is based in London, told BBC Radio 4: ""It feels unreal… it feels inhumane… it is very upsetting to think that this is even possible.""
The Israeli government hasannounced a complete siege of Gaza, cutting off food, medicine and power.
The country's armed forces are also carrying out a large-scale bombing campaign which has already killed about 500 people.
Dr Atef Alshaer, an academic at the University of Westminster who grew up in Gazan town of Rafah, said he was worried about his family who still live there.
""What is sad is to see harm done to the innocent and that is constant,"" he said.
He added: ""It's apocalyptic. I don't really exaggerate because you've got it in a really densely populated area and the bombing is really intense.
""They're very decent people, they don't deserve this.""
In London, police have launched an investigation after pro-Palestinian graffiti was daubed on bridges in Golders Green.
British Transport Police (BTP) said officers were called to the site, near Golders Green Underground station, at about 08:45 BST.
Golders Green has a prominent Jewish population.
BTP said the graffiti was being investigated as a potential hate crime.
A kosher restaurant in Golders Green also had its window smashed and cash register stolen, but this is not being treated as a hate crime, the Met Police said.

Israeli forces detain director of Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital,2023-11-23,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israeli forces have detained the director of Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital for questioning, a week after their controversial raid there.
Dr Mohammed Abu Salmiya was held at a checkpoint as he evacuated patients to the south, a colleague told the BBC.
The Israeli military said he was being questioned over evidence that al-Shifa ""served as a Hamas command and control centre"". He and Hamas have denied that.
Meanwhile, heavy fire was reported around another hospital in the north.
A doctor at the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia said Israeli troops had also ordered its full evacuation. The Israeli military said it was checking the reports.
Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip with the objective of destroying Hamas - which it classes as a terrorist organisation - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,500 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the Israeli air and ground strikes began, while the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian crisis.
On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to exchange 50 of the hostages - all children and women - for a four-day pause in the fighting.
Mediator Qatar says the truce will start at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday, with the first group of 13 hostages to be released at 16:00.
About 250 patients and staff members are estimated to remain at al-Shifa, which is the biggest medical facility in Gaza but is no longer operational.
On Wednesday, 190 wounded and sick people, their companions, and a number of medical teams were evacuated from the hospital in an ambulance convoy to the south, in co-ordination with the World Health Organization and other humanitarian agencies, according to the United Nations.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said in a statement overnightthat the evacuation process lasted for almost 20 hours ""as the convoy was obstructed and subjected to careful inspection while passing through the checkpoint"" on Salah al-Din Road that separates northern and southern Gaza.
""Furthermore, three paramedics and a companion of a wounded person were detained. The latter and two paramedics were later released, while the third paramedic, colleague Awni Khattab, is still detained until this moment.""
Neither the UN or PRCS mentioned Dr Abu Salmiya. But the head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa, Dr Adnan al-Bursh, told the BBC he had also been detained while accompanying the evacuated patients on Wednesday.
On Thursday afternoon, the Israeli military confirmed that Dr Abu Salmiya had been taken for questioning by the Shin Bet internal security agency, ""following evidence showing that al-Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre"".
""The Hamas terror tunnel network situated under the hospital also exploited electricity and resources taken from the hospital. In addition, Hamas stored numerous weapons inside the hospital and on the hospital grounds.
""Furthermore, after the Hamas massacre on 7 October, Hamas terrorists sought refuge within the hospital, some of them taking hostages from Israel with them,"" it added, also alleging that a female soldier who had been taken hostage was murdered on the premises.
Hamas has repeatedly denied that the hospital was used as a shelter by fighters, as have hospital staff and health ministry officials. Hamas has also claimed the soldier was killed in an Israeli air strike.
On Wednesday, the Israeli military showed embedded journalists what it said was further evidence of a Hamas ""terror tunnel complex"" beneath al-Shifa.
A Reuters news agency reporter said he had accessed a reinforced underground tunnel through an outdoor shaft in the hospital's grounds. The tunnel led to a series of rooms, including a bathroom, kitchen and an air conditioned meeting room that the military said was used by Hamas commanders, he added.
Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. This protection extends to patients, as well as to medical staff and ambulances.
However, hospitals can lose their protection if they are used by a party to the conflict to commit an ""act harmful to the enemy"".
In a separate development on Thursday, a senior doctor and a health ministry official said Israeli troops had ordered the full evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital, outside which fighting has been raging in recent days.
The Indonesian Hospital's medical director, Dr Marwan Sultan, told the BBC the situation inside was ""very difficult"", with ""heavy firing continuing around the hospital, from tanks, every 15 minutes"".
""We cannot stay in rooms, as the windows are being hit,"" he said. ""We are staying in corridors in the hospital. My office was targeted several times.""
""We are currently 10 medical professionals and 200 patients. No Israeli soldiers are currently inside the hospital, but we expect the same scenario as al-Shifa to happen unless the truce takes place,"" he added.
""We asked Gaza's health ministry for three buses today to evacuate the Indonesian Hospital, and we asked also for 13 ambulances for patients who cannot be seated. They are liaising with the Red Cross.""
The Israeli military said on Thursday morning that its troops were ""striking terror targets"" in the Jabalia area, which is just to the south of the hospital.
On Monday, the health ministry said 12 patients and other civilians at the hospital had been killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said its troops had targeted ""terrorists"" who opened fire at them from inside the facility.
Deadly Israeli strikes were also reported in the north of Gaza on Thursday, as well as in the southern city of Khan Younis.

Israel's Jenin operation reignites Palestinian anger,2023-07-04,BBC,By Jeremy Bowen,"A thick crust of black ash has settled on the pavements and roads in the centre of Jenin.
It comes from barricades of burning tyres set up by young Palestinian men, who prowl streets where they might see an Israeli jeep. Some of them carry rocks or small home-made bombs to hurl at passing Israeli vehicles. In sporadic bursts, gunfire and explosions echo in the refugee camp, which is on high ground above the town centre. Israeli drones buzz constantly overhead.
At times, armed Palestinians emerge from the tyre smoke to fire at the Israelis.
Violence between Palestinians and Israelis has become almost a daily event this year.  When blood is spilt there is often a dynamic of retaliation, that includes Palestinian armed groups, Jews who live in settlements in the occupied West Bank that are illegal under international law, and the Israeli army. The Israelis said they moved in on the Jenin camp because more than 50 relatively recent attacks were launched from there.
But the roots of violence, despair and hatred go much deeper than the latest violent confrontations. They thrive in the poison generated by a conflict over possession of the land that started more than a century ago. For a while, back in the 1990s, there were hopes that peace might come if an independent Palestinian state could be established alongside Israel, the so-called two-state solution. The attempt failed.
Powerful Western countries, including the US, European Union members and the UK still insist that two states are the only possible solution. Their words are empty slogans. The last American attempt to try to make the idea work collapsed in 2014.
The Israeli operation here in Jenin was in the air for months. Despite regular smaller Israeli raids, Palestinian armed groups had become strong enough and united enough to control the Jenin refugee camp. They seemed to be getting stronger.
A fortnight ago they blew up an Israeli jeep and fought hard to repel an Israeli raid, in which the Palestinian dead included a 15-year-old girl. The next day four Israelis were killed by two Palestinians who burst into a restaurant not far from Jenin, where they were eating. The Israeli army protected Jewish settlers who rampaged through Palestinian villages burning cars and houses, in a series of reprisals.
It was a matter of time before the Israeli army moved against the Palestinians who controlled Jenin refugee camp. It says it is carrying out a systematic operation to track down and destroy weapons and explosives.
Fury and frustration rage through young Palestinian men who have gathered in angry knots at road junctions in the town and outside a hospital on the edge of the Jenin refugee camp. Their barricades of burning tyres leave behind black circles and piles of burnt rubber and twisted wire.
The Israeli army is releasing updates on explosives discovered and neutralised in the two days it has been in the camp, along with what it calls terrorist command centres. The business-like tone of the military communiques contrasts with the statements made by members of the Israeli cabinet who oppose any kind of Palestinian self-determination.
After a Palestinian was shot dead in Tel Aviv by a passer-by, after he had rammed his car into a crowd of Israelis, public security minister Itamar Ben Gvir issued a statement saying Israel's war in Jenin was also their war in Tel Aviv. Every Jew, he said, was a target for murderers.
Mr Ben Gvir and his political allies have been pressing for a punitive sweep through the West Bank to deal with their enemies.  The Israeli army is more cautious, as it is more worried about the risks and consequences of escalation. All the indications are the Israeli army would like to restrict its operation to the Jenin refugee camp, declare victory soon and order its soldiers back to their bases.
Israeli victories after an operation like this never last long. Palestinian armed groups restock their armouries and the cycle begins again. Plans to expand settlements for Jews on occupied land that Palestinians want for a state, sometimes called a Zionist response by Israeli politicians, also raise the temperature.
Many Palestinians are disenchanted with their own ageing and ineffective leaders in the Palestinian Authority, a legacy of the 1990s peace process that was supposed back then to build the institutions necessary to create their own state.
When this operation ends, on past form both sides will claim victory. Then the current realities of this long conflict will reassert themselves. Anger, despair and poverty will reinforce the culture of resistance that has embedded itself in Palestinian society, especially here in Jenin and in Nablus. And Israel's right-wing, hyper-nationalist government, as long as it lasts, will try to match its rhetoric with action.
The real danger is that Israelis and Palestinians are sliding into an even more violent phase of their long conflict.

"Egypt warned Israel days before Hamas struck, US committee chairman says",,BBC,,"Israel was warned by Egypt of potential violence three days before Hamas' deadly cross-border raid, a US congressional panel chairman has said.
House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee head Michael McCaul told reporters of the alleged warning.
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu described the reports as ""absolutely false"".
Israeli intelligence services are under scrutiny for their failure to prevent the deadliest attack by Palestinian militants in Israel's 75-year history.
""We know that Egypt has warned the Israelis three days prior that an event like this could happen,"" Mr McCaul told reporters following a closed-door intelligence briefing on Wednesday for lawmakers about the Middle East crisis, according to AFP news agency.
""I don't want to get too much into classified, but a warning was given,"" the Texas Republican added. ""I think the question was at what level.""
An Egyptian intelligence official told the Associated Press news agency this week that Cairo had repeatedly warned the Israelis ""something big"" was being planned from Gaza.
""We have warned them an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big. But they underestimated such warnings,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Cairo official said Israeli officials had played down the threat from Gaza, instead focusing on the West Bank.
Sir Alex Younger, who served as chief of the UK's foreign intelligence agency between 2014 and 2020, said Hamas fighters were able to carry out their attack on 7 October due to ""institutional complacency"" in Israel.
He told BBC Radio 4'sToday Podcastthere may have been an assumption by Israel that Hamas was not interested in a new conflict, so any information that contradicted that was discounted.
""It is my assumption - though I'm not on the inside - that there would be data breaking through that could have been interpreted differently and certainly would be with hindsight,"" he said.
He added that complacency could have been compounded by an over-reliance on technological means to monitor Gaza, leading to a false sense of security.
According to the Financial Times, quoting two unnamed officials familiar with the matter, there was no hard intelligence of a specific attack.
On Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu described any suggestion that Israel had received a specific warning in advance of the deadly incursion as ""totally fake news"".
Egypt - which controls who crosses its border with Gaza - often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas.
More than 1,500 militants stormed through the Gaza security barrier in a co-ordinated land, air and sea attack on Saturday.
The death toll in Israel from the Hamas attacks has reached 1,200. More than 1,000 people have been killed by Israeli air strikes on Gaza.
Israel has been pounding Hamas targets in Gaza in response, while residents of the territory say they have no mains electricity after their only power station ran out of fuel.
Hamas has, meanwhile, condemned US President Joe Biden's remarks on Tuesday saying Israel had a duty to respond to the attacks, which he called an ""act of sheer evil"".
The Palestinian group said Mr Biden's remarks were ""inflammatory"" and aimed to escalate tensions in the Gaza Strip.
In the wake of the Hamas attack, the US announced it was moving an aircraft carrier, ships and jets to the eastern Mediterranean, and that it would also give Israel additional equipment and ammunition.

Palestinian-Americans struggle with survivors' guilt,2023-11-23,BBC,By Brandon Drenon,"For many Palestinian-Americans living thousands of miles away from Gaza but watching the deadly violence from afar, it's more than grief that grips them - it's also guilt.
""I think guilt is a feeling that a lot of Palestinians in the diaspora feel because every single Palestinian has Palestine in their heart, no matter where we live,"" says Anees, a Palestinian-American musician who lives in Virginia.
The 31-year-old has a huge Instagram following of 1.7 million people, and since the start of the Israel-Gaza war has used his platform to post about the war and call for a ceasefire.
""When we see the devastation, when we see the killings, I think inherently we feel this guilt that it could have been us,"" he says.
Since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 people hostage, the Israeli military has responded with a heavy bombing campaign which it says is aimed at Hamas but which the UN says is ""wiping out whole families and entire neighbourhoods"". More than 14,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Palestinian-Americans who spoke to the BBC say watching what's happening in Gaza unfold on social media feeds and TV screens has been emotionally debilitating.
""Everything I enjoy - every little thing - from the smallest to the biggest joy, my second thought is [Palestinians in Gaza] don't get to enjoy this,"" says Anees.
""I'm still able to go with safety to the grocery store without being bombed. I'm still able to go out to dinner without being bombed.""
In the minds of many Palestinian-Americans, the answers for how and why they're in the US only add to the complexity of emotions - many are the children and grandchildren of Palestinians who fled previous wars.
Jinan Deena, born in Ohio and one of seven million Palestinians around the world, says her grandmother was one of up to 750,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced out of their homes at gunpoint in the war that followed Israel's creation in 1948.
This violent displacement is what Palestinians today call al Nakba, or ""the Catastrophe"", and it pushed Jinan's grandparents to want to leave, she says.
Her family first resettled in the West Bank, where Jinan's mother was born, before coming to the US in 1981.
""Sometimes I wonder what if my mom stayed, and I was born and raised there?""
Jinan, 41, spent many summers in the West Bank and lived there for two years as a teenager. But her family eventually returned to the US because ""it just wasn't easy for us to go from living in America to living under occupation"".
The presence of Israeli military tanks and checkpoints, tear gas and rubber bullets was too much, she says.
""I look back at us leaving, and I'm like, 'Was that a cowardly thing to do? What makes me better than them?' Palestinian guilt has different levels to it.""
The US sends Israel billions of dollars in military aid every year, and a bill is making its way through Congress which would send more.
""I also feel guilty as an American, because my tax money is going to fund this huge war,"" says Jinan.
The rising death toll has intensified the emotional distress of Palestinian Americans. At least 5,600 children in Gaza have died since 7 October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And the number grows each day, ""becoming a graveyard for children"", according to the UN.
""I feel helpless, and I feel hopeless,"" says Jinan. ""I find joy in absolutely nothing.""
Feelings of guilt are also amplified by news of living conditions on the ground. Residents of Gaza have had their access to water cut off by Israeli blockades, and are facing food and water shortages and disease. Some residents of Gaza have told the BBC that they have been driven to drink sea water.
""I was running water into a massive pot to boil potatoes and I just broke down crying,"" Marcelle Afram recalls.
""Here I am just being able to turn on the faucet and literally pour more water into one pot to boil potatoes than one person in Gaza is able to have in an entire week right now.""
Marcelle, a food catering business owner in Washington DC, says feelings of guilt have moved him to turn down work that isn't related to fundraising for Palestinian causes.
""If I don't use everything at my disposal to help, I will have to live with that for the rest of my life.""
It's a sentiment echoed by Anees, who says he only uses his platform now to speak about the war.
Stephanie, an administrator of a Facebook group for Palestinians, says she feels similarly. She asked that we not use her last name, saying she has received threatening messages on Facebook since becoming more vocally pro-Palestinian.
Pregnant with her first child, intense nausea and fatigue kept her on the sidelines during some of the initial protests in Boston. Instead, she says she tried to be an ""activist at home"" and made calls to her state representatives urging for a ceasefire.

US sanctions individuals implicated in West Bank attacks,2023-12-05,BBC,By Max Matza,"The US has announced a visa ban on extremists responsible for violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was taking action to target attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians.
But the top diplomat said the ban would also apply to Palestinians accused of violence.
Attacks have surged in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's assault on southern Israel on 7 October.
US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said the ban would affect ""dozens"" of extremist Israelis and some of their family members. He said that laws forbid the US from naming those targeted.
The move marks the latest expression of frustration from Washington at the Israeli government's position towards settlers. Senior far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich - both settlers themselves - have previously been accused of seeking to downplay violence in the West Bank.
And in recent weeks Palestinians in the West Bankhave told BBC Newsthat Israeli settlers are using the war in Gaza as an opportunity to seize land.
More than 700,000 Jewish people live in more than 250 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the US dispute this interpretation.
The UN says it has recorded 314 settler attacks against Palestinians since 7 October, resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to Palestinian-owned property. Four Israelis, including three security forces personnel, have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in the West Bank over the same period.
""We have underscored to the Israeli government the need to do more to hold accountable extremist settlers who have committed violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank,"" Mr Blinken said in a statement on Tuesday. ""As President Biden has repeatedly said, those attacks are unacceptable.""
The decision comes just over a month after Israel was accepted into the US Visa Waiver Program, which allows Israeli citizens visa-free travel to the US.
Individuals targeted by Tuesday's announcement will not be eligible for the programme, according to the Associated Press news agency, and current US visa holders will have their travel passes revoked.
American passport holders are not affected by the new policy.
Reacting to the US decision, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters: ""There is, sadly, violence from extremists that we must condemn.""
""In a state of law, and Israel is a state of law, the right to use violence belongs only to those who are certified to do so by the government,"" he said, according to Reuters.

Anger and despair as Palestinians queue for supplies during truce,2023-11-29,BBC,"By Adnan El-Bursh in Deir al-Balah, Gaza","""Where are all Arabs and Muslims? Where are all the defenders of human rights? You've left the Palestinian people to suffer, go hungry and be destroyed.""
A middle-aged woman rails at the world in a queue for cooking gas in Deir al-Balah, a town in the centre of the Gaza Strip.
She shouts angrily in the air, desperation and frustration visible in her face, despair lurking in the background.
""We've been waiting in line to fill one gas cylinder since early morning. I performed my morning prayers while standing.""
She tells me that she had to flee her home in Beit Hanoun in the north, just 2km (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel.
""I can't describe the destruction. Entire families have been erased from civil records. They were killed under their houses.
""Gaza has been completely destroyed. Have mercy on us.""
She is now living with her family at a UN-run school in Deir al-Balah.
After Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostage, Israel started air strikes and then launched a ground invasion.
At least 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
The Gaza Strip is home to 2.3 million people and the UN says 80% have been displaced by the conflict, with Israel ordering everyone living in the north to evacuate south of the Wadi Gaza river.
On Friday, a four-day pause in the fighting began under a deal between Israel and Hamas, which saw 50 of the hostages held in Gaza freed in return for the release of 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
The two sides later extended the truce for two days from Tuesday to allow an additional 20 hostages and 60 prisoners to be released.
The agreement also allowed more aid to be sent to Gaza.
Up to 200 aid lorries have been crossing from Egypt each day. But that is still less than half of the number of lorries that entered daily before the war.
UN agencies have said they have been able to deliver some of that aid to the north, which has been the focus of the Israeli ground offensive, but there are huge shortages everywhere.
There are hundreds in the queue for cooking gas in Deir al-Balah, about 6km south of Wadi Gaza. Young men sit on gas cylinders as they wait. The air is tense. People are exhausted.
""You can't find a cup of tea or one pack of biscuits. Yesterday, people were sharing bread while sleeping on the street,"" says another man in the queue.
""The rain that we witnessed yesterday and the cold we went through. People spent the night here. May God help us.""
Israel cut off electricity and most water, and stopped deliveries of food, fuel and other goods to Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's attack.
Limited aid deliveries resumed on 21 October, but Israel halted all fuel shipments until 15 November and then allowed in only a limited amount. A US official says 140,000 litres of fuel is currently being delivered every two days.
The Israeli government says the fuel could be used by Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in Israel, the EU, UK and US.
Mohammed al-Qidrah is waiting patiently in the cooking gas queue.
""We've been here for three days. We came here two nights ago and from 03:00 until now, we haven't been able to fill up,"" he says.
""We can't find fuel, flour or anything. You need to stand in line for everything and you struggle to find it.""
The World Health Organization is warning that more people will die from disease than in bombings in Gaza if the health infrastructure is not restored.
Meanwhile, a UN-led aid consortium says 60% of the buildings in the territory are damaged or destroyed.
As the truce holds, there are signs some life is returning to Gaza, with people trying to harvest the remainder of this year's olive crop.
""We have to take advantage of this opportunity, there's no time,"" farmer Fathy Abu Salah told the Reuters news agency at his olive grove near the southern city of Khan Younis.
""This war destroyed us, there's hardly any production. The majority of the harvest was wasted.""
A lack of electricity has also left the local olive press reliant on fuel to power its machinery.
""Finding fuel is a crisis that everyone is facing,"" says olive farmer and press worker Mohamed Wafy.
""As soon as we secured access to fuel, we were able to open the olive press, even if it's working at minimum capacity.""

Israeli forces surround north Gaza hospitals,2023-11-10,BBC,By Laura Gozzi,"Shelling, gunshots and explosions took place outside Gaza City hospitals on Friday as Israeli forces continued their ground operation against Hamas.
Social media videos showed panicked and injured people running for cover.
Israel has always maintained that Hamas fighters hide in tunnels under hospitals, making the structures legitimate targets.
The Red Cross warned that hospitals in Gaza had ""reached a point of no return"".
It added that its staff attempting to deliver medical supplies had witnessed ""horrendous"" scenes, and described the destruction as ""unbearable"".
In Gaza as a whole, the Hamas-run health ministry says 11,078 people have been killed since the start of the war and more than 27,000 others have been injured.
Israel's bombardment of Gaza and ground operations followed Hamas's unprecedented mass attack on southern Israel on 7 October.
On Friday evening, Israel revised down the number of people killed during the attack to about 1,200, from the earlier figure of 1,400.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said the revised number was because many bodies were not immediately identified after the attack, and ""now we think those belong to terrorists... not Israeli casualties"".
Reports that Israeli forces in Gaza were surrounding several hospitals in Gaza City began to emerge early on Friday morning.
One person inside the Al-Quds hospital told the BBC that they could hear ""continuous clashes and explosions"", while eyewitnesses near the Al-Rantisi Paediatric Hospital said that Israeli troops were using megaphones to order anyone who was not medical staff or patients to leave the premises.
In one video posted on social media and verified by the BBC, a large group of civilians - many of them carrying white flags - can be seen trying to leave the courtyard of another hospital, Al-Nasr, when gunshots ring out, sending panicked people running for cover.
Videos posted on social media appeared to show the aftermath of a missile or mortar striking the courtyard at Al-Shifa, the city's largest hospital, while others appeared to show dead children and scenes of panic outside the outpatients' clinic.
Dr Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said that up to five Israeli strikes had damaged parts of Al-Shifa hospital, including the maternity ward.
""If Al-Shifa hospital goes out of service it will be a disaster for the people of Gaza City,"" Dr Al-Qudra said, adding that staff were afraid.
The Hamas government reported 13 deaths at Al-Shifa, while Dr Al-Qudra said he knew of one fatality but could not confirm any others.
By Friday evening, tensions in Gaza City remained high.
People inside Al-Shifa said they could still hear explosions and firing around the hospital and that Israeli tanks were about 100m (328ft) away.
The director of the hospital told the BBC that around 15,000 people remained in the structure - largely the elderly and the sick who cannot make the journey further south to where Israel has promised greater safety. He added that staff were overwhelmed by the number of injured people and were having to treat people in corridors and on the floor.
The fighting around Al-Quds hospital also intensified as night fell. The BBC understands an Israeli navy ship was involved as well as tanks, which have surrounded the hospital.
Speaking at the UN Security Council on Friday, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the situation on the ground in Gaza was ""impossible to describe"".
Dr Tedros said that hospital corridors were ""crammed with the injured, the sick, the dying"", that morgues were ""overflowing"", and that surgeries was being performed without anaesthesia.
He added that half of the Gaza Strip's 36 hospitals were not functioning at all, and that the remaining ones were operating ""way beyond their capacities"". He said that civilians in Gaza ""are not responsible for this violence, but are suffering in ways that we in this room cannot imagine.""
A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the IDF ""does not fire on hospitals"" but that ""we'll do what we need to"" if Hamas fired from hospital grounds.
When asked what the plan was to deal with patients in the hospitals who could not walk, or those who were on drips and with broken bones, he said: ""Our plan is - and we're taking an operational risk here - we're saying to Hamas to move people south.""
Hamas has previously denied claims that it places command posts under Gaza hospitals to use them as shields.
The US says Israel has agreed to daily four-hour military pauses in northern Gaza for humanitarian purposes - yet the fighting remained intense on Friday.

Panic and confusion at scene of Gaza hospital blast,2023-10-18,BBC,By Rushdi Abu Alouf,"Palestinian health officials now say that at least 471 people were killed by an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday night. They blame an Israeli air strike, but Israel's military says the blast was caused by a failed rocket launch by the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf visited the scene and found that body parts are still being collected.
Blood-soaked mattresses are strewn across the courtyard of the Al-Ahli Arab hospital, along with clothing and personal possessions left behind in the chaos that followed the blast and the huge fire it caused.
In a nearby car park lie the smouldering wrecks of more than a dozen cars.
The surrounding buildings are also damaged, apparently pockmarked by shrapnel. But no large impact crater is visible.
There is an atmosphere of panic, with people struggling to understand what happened at a place that was supposed to be protected under international humanitarian law.
""We left our home to come here,"" a woman who survived the explosion told the BBC. ""We thought it would be safe, but then it got bombed.""
Doctors said that most of the victims were among the several thousand civilians who had been sheltering at the hospital since Friday. They fled there after the Israeli military told civilians to evacuate the north of the Gaza Strip, as it stepped up its air strikes on militant group Hamas.
Many staying inside the courtyard were elderly or infirm, unable to leave for the south because they did not have access to transport.
One witness told me that they had been sitting on the ground when it was rocked by a huge blast.
People from all around the Gaza Strip soon arrived at the scene to try to help, he said. They collected bodies and began evacuating injured people.
Those in a serious condition were taken away on motorbikes, while those less hurt had to make their way on foot to Shifa hospital, 3km (two miles) away.
A second man said he heard something just before the blast but did not know what it was.
He explained that he returned to the hospital afterwards because there was no other option.
""Where else can we go? Are we leaving like in 1948?"" he asked, referring to the first Arab-Israeli war, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced or fled from their homes.
Despite their protected status, 20 hospitals in the north, including Al-Ahli Arab, have received orders to evacuate their patients and staff, according to the World Health Organization.
The UN agency has said the orders are impossible to carry out, given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, lack of ambulances, and shortage of beds elsewhere, and warned that it will ""further worsen the current humanitarian and public health catastrophe"".

Rafah crossing: Thousands of people arrive at Gaza-Egypt border,2023-10-16,BBC,By Ece Goksedef,"Thousands of people in Gaza have gathered at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, as diplomatic efforts continue to open it before Israel starts its expected ground operation.
But the United Nations said there had been no progress in negotiations on reopening of the crossing.
Cairo blames Israel for ""not co-operating"".
All routes out of Gaza are closed, as Israel continues its air strikes in response to Hamas' attack of 7 October.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Monday for the second time in less than a week.
After his tour of six Arab states in the region, he returned to the country in an attempt to push for the reopening of the crossing to let in humanitarian aid and evacuate foreign passport holders.
Both Mr Blinken and UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said they were working with Israel, Egypt and ""other leading political voices in the region"" to re-open the crossing.
The Israeli military ordered a blockade of Gaza and cut off the supply of water, food and fuel last week before launching a wave of air strikes in retaliation to Hamas' deadly attack on Israel during which militants raided communities, kidnapped civilians and soldiers and killed more than 1,400 people.
On Monday morning, thousands of civilians rushed to the Rafah crossing following reports that it would be temporarily re-opened during a brief ceasefire on Monday.
Both Israel and Hamas swiftly denied that any such agreement had been made.
Later, a BBC correspondent in southern Gaza confirmed an air strike had hit the area around the crossing, damaging a building on the Palestinian side of the crossing as well as the road.
Video analysed by BBC Verify appeared to show a strike on the crossing on Monday.
Israel has hit the area around the Rafah crossing point at least three times since it began its air campaign on Gaza.
The crossing represents the only potential exit point from Gaza while the Israeli siege of other entry points to the Hamas-controlled territory continues.
Dozens of lorries carrying fuel and aid supplies remain on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, waiting for permission to enter, as the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorates.
Israel says the siege will not end until Hamas releases the hostages it seized from Israel on 7 October. The Israelis believe 199 people are being held in Gaza, up from an earlier estimate of 155.
Around 2,750 people have died in Gaza since the Hamas assault and more than one million people have been displaced.
""There is an urgent need to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,"" Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said on Monday morning, adding that talks with Israel had been fruitless.
Cairo has been focusing on getting humanitarian aid for civilians into Gaza. Mr Shoukry said Egypt could allow medical evacuations and let in some Gazans with permission to travel.
A number of countries, including the US and the UK, have recommended that its citizens head towards the Rafah crossing, ready for its possible reopening.
Although Egypt appears to be prepared to re-open the Rafah crossing to allow foreign passport holders out and humanitarian aid in, it fears a massive influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war.
Egypt and other Arab states say a this would be unacceptable because it would amount to the expulsion of Palestinians from their land.

Palestinians set out terms for agreeing to historic Saudi-Israeli deal,2023-09-06,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"A cash boost of hundreds of millions of dollars and more control of land in the occupied West Bank are among Palestinian demands in the event of a three-way deal involving the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel, the BBC has learned.
Officials from the Palestinian Authority (PA) held talks in Riyadh with Saudi counterparts on Wednesday.
They were also due to see US officials.
The Americans are long thought to have been pushing for a landmark pact to normalise Israel-Saudi ties.
It would be underwritten by Washington and would include a major security deal the Saudis want to achieve with the US. But the prospects for such agreements face significant obstacles and remain distant.
""We don't expect any imminent announcements or breakthroughs in the period ahead,"" said White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday.
However, given the scope for a historic realignment of ties in the Middle East, there is continuing speculation over the framework for any deal, with American shuttle diplomacy picking up again after trips by officials to Riyadh, Amman and Jerusalem this summer.
US President Joe Biden is likely to see a Saudi-Israel deal as a breakthrough foreign policy prize he can present to voters ahead of next year's election.
Saudi Arabia is a leader of the Arab and Islamic world. It has never formally recognised Israel since the creation of the state in 1948.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talked up the possibility last month, claiming: ""We're about to witness a pivot of history.""
Any deal, though, would be deeply controversial.
In return for recognising Israel, Saudi Arabia is said to be demanding US guarantees for advanced American-made weapons and, most contentious of all, a civil nuclear programme including in-country uranium enrichment.
Israel for its part would benefit from trade and defence ties with the Gulf superpower and further historic integration it has always sought in the region, following on from other Arab state normalisation deals brokered in 2020.
""These are mostly security and trade agreements. Fast forward to the year 2023, and we now see that Saudi Arabia also wants to get involved in this,"" said Diana Buttu, a former legal adviser to the official Palestinian negotiating team in the now-moribund peace talks with the Israelis.
For a deal to succeed it would have to be seen to involve significant Israeli concessions to the Palestinians.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, needs to assuage his own public - historically opposed to Israel and deeply sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.
Meanwhile, President Biden will also need to prove he has won significant gains for the Palestinians to get support from his Democratic Party. Many in the party reject the idea of any defence sweeteners for the Saudis due to the country's human rights record and its role in the war in Yemen. They are also hostile to the idea of rewarding Israel's current extreme nationalist governing coalition, which they see as exacerbating tensions in the West Bank and which has sparked unprecedented instability within Israel itself.
The team of top Palestinian officials in Riyadh - including the two men seen as closest to President Mahmoud Abbas, the PA's intelligence chief, Majed Faraj, and Hussein al-Sheikh, secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation - met Saudi national security adviser Musaed al-Aiban on Wednesday, according to a senior Palestinian official familiar with the discussions.
Their list of demands in return for engaging with the American-backed process was set out during a meeting with US Assistant Secretary of State Barbara Leaf last week in Amman. The Palestinian official told the BBC the demands include:
Such concessions are very significant - reportedly already seen by the Americans as overreaching by the Palestinians. But they are a far cry from the official, publicly stated Palestinian position on Saudi-Israel normalisation - which is to reject it outright if it does not leave them with an independent state.
This follows the Arab Peace Initiative, a Saudi-led plan of 2002, which offered the Arab world's recognition of Israel in return for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in East Jerusalem.
The current approach reflects the deep ""bind"" the Palestinian leadership is in, according to Ms Buttu.
""Palestinians by and large don't want to be part of any of these normalisation deals because [the Arab world's support] is the only tool that we have left,"" she said.
""We've been told that we're not allowed to violently resist. We're told that we're not allowed to pursue legal measures to demand an end to the occupation. We're told that we're not allowed to pursue boycotts, divestment and sanction.""
""The Palestinian Authority is now questioning: should we instead be trying to get our demands heard and realised, or should we do what we did in 2020 which was to ignore it? And again it's a bind - no matter what the Palestinian Authority does on this, it is doomed to fail,"" Ms Buttu told the BBC.
In 2020, three Arab countries - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco - normalised ties with Israel in deals brokered by the US under President Trump. A fourth, Sudan, also pledged to take steps towards diplomatic ties with Israel that year. But theprocess stalledamid opposition in the country and a military coup the following year.
They were seen as a historic shift in relations between old adversaries in the Middle East, involving diplomatic, trade and security ties. But criticshighlighted the significant US inducementsalso involved, including access to top-shelf American-made weapons for Arab autocracies.
At the time, the PA was frozen out of discussions as it boycotted diplomatic ties with the US in response to President Trump's Israeli-Palestinian ""deal of the century"" - a peace plan heavily weighted towards Israel - and his move of the US embassy to Jerusalem. The PA saw the normalisation deals as a ""betrayal"" of Arab solidarity.
Instead, engaging with the Saudis this time may be a way to remind Riyadh of the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative - the goal of an independent Palestinian state - rather than being left out of the process completely, suggested another senior Palestinian official.
But there are significant risks for the Palestinian leadership - already deeply unpopular with its own public - in becoming involved if the benefits are perceived as negligible.
Polling after the UAE-Israel normalisation in 2020 suggested the overwhelming majority of Palestinians saw that deal as an abandonment of the Palestinian cause that served only the interests of Israel.
Any Israeli concessions to the Palestinians are almost certain to be rejected by the ultranationalists in Mr Netanyahu's coalition, amounting to a further stumbling block to any deal. Mr Netanyahu earlier this year brushed aside Palestinian concessions as a ""check box"" exercise that wouldn't be part of any substantive American-brokered discussions with Saudi Arabia.

Palestinian toddler shot by Israeli soldiers dies,2023-06-05,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"A two-year-old Palestinian boy has died four days after being shot in the head by Israeli forces.
Mohammed Tamimi and his father were shot while leaving their home in Nabi Saleh, in the occupied West Bank.
The Israel military said its soldiers opened fire while in pursuit of two gunmen who had earlier shot at a nearby Jewish settlement.
In a statement after the incident, the military added that it regretted harm to ""non-combatants"".
Palestinian activist and journalist Bilal Tamimi - who was also injured - said that the Israeli army was waiting to ambush a car at the entrance to Nabi Saleh and opened fire as it approached.
The toddler was taken by an Israeli military helicopter to Safra Children's Hospital in Israel to be treated for head injuries, but did not recover.
His father, Haitham, has now been discharged from a Palestinian hospital. It is understood he was able to visit his son in Israel before he died.
The Israeli military, which has a post just outside Nabi Saleh, previously released grainy video which apparently shows two figures shooting guns. It said the shooting towards the settlement of Halamish - also known as Neveh Tzuf - lasted ""several minutes"".
It said that its soldiers responded with live fire, causing two Palestinians to be injured.
""The [Israeli military] regrets harm to non-combatants and is committed to doing everything in its power to prevent such incidents. The incident is under review,"" it stated.
The settlement of Halamish was set up in the 1970s and has long been a source of friction with Palestinian villagers living close by.
For several years, Friday demonstrations took place in Nabi Saleh, with local activists protesting against the confiscation of the village's lands and the takeover of its spring.
These would often lead to violent confrontations with Israeli soldiers using tear gas and rubber bullets to block their path.
Since the start of the year, some 150 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The figures include militants as well as civilians.
In addition, 23 people on the Israeli side have been killed - including two foreigners and a Palestinian worker - in attacks or apparent attacks by Palestinians. All were civilians except one off-duty serving soldier and a member of the Israeli security forces.
On both sides, there are children among the dead. Mohammed Tamimi was the youngest Palestinian to have been killed in the West Bank.
Some 700,000 settlers currently live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Settlements are considered illegal under international law although Israel disputes that.
Update 7 June 2023: This story has been updated to say that Mohammed Tamimi was two years old and not three, as official sources initially reported, as well as to clarify that attacks or apparent attacks by Palestinians have killed 23 people this year.

CCTV shows the militants attempting to crawl under the gates at the entrance. When that failed, they hid in a booth before ambushing an approaching car, killing the occupants, then walking through the gates.
Footage also shows some of the militants leaving the area through the same gate over an hour later.
However, other footage, which is too graphic to include here, shows that militants were still present in the kibbutz two hours after first entering.

"'Isis-level savagery' by Hamas killed 11 Americans, says US",2023-10-09,BBC,By Gareth Evans & Bernd Debusmann Jr,"At least 11 Americans have been killed in Israel after Hamas militants launched an attack on the country, US President Joe Biden said on Monday.
In a briefing with reporters at the same time, a senior US defence official accused Hamas of ""Isis-level savagery"" in an unprecedented attack.
The identities of those killed have not been announced by officials.
Mr Biden said that it is ""likely"" that some US citizens are among the hostages being held by Hamas.
""It's heart wrenching. These families have been torn apart by inexcusable hatred and violence,"" Mr Biden said in a written statement.
Mr Biden said that the US was also deploying experts to help Israel find the hostages, and was sharing intelligence.
Washington is increasing support in the form of air defence and munitions, the senior defence official said in a call with the media.
Israel says about 900 people have been killed and 100 kidnapped since Hamas militants launched the surprise attack in the early hours of Saturday.
In Gaza, more than 600 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli air strikes.
Ilan Troen, a professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, said that his daughter Deborah Matias, 50 and her husband Shlomi, were killed when Hamas fighters attacked their community in southern Israel.
Mr Troen told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that his daughter died while shielding their son Roten.
""They made sure to fall on him and thereby saved his life,"" he said. ""Although a bullet actually entered his abdomen, but he was saved.""
On Facebook, Cincinnati native and long-time Israel resident Hannah Katsman said that her son Hayim Katsman was killed at his kibbutz near the border with Gaza.
Mr Katsman, an academic who specialised in Israel studies, was a graduate of the University of Washington.
Among the missing is 23-year-old American-Israeli Hersh Golberg-Polin, who was at a music festival in the desert which was stormed by militants.
His parents told the Jerusalem Post they received two messages from him, reading ""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry"".
""We just want him safe,"" Jonathan Polin, his father, said.
Another soldier with dual US-Israeli citizenship, Itay Chen, has reportedly been missing in action since Saturday.
His father, Ruby Chen, told CNN that he had sought the State Department's help in finding his son, but believes that the US is ""taking a back seat"" in the investigation. He added that it is ""a fair assumption"" to believe his son was taken to Gaza.
Another US citizen living in Israel, Abbey Onn, told MSNBC that five members of her family were taken hostage. On Saturday, she received a WhatsApp message from her family that Hamas fighters were in their home at Nir Oz near Gaza.
She later saw one of her relatives, a 12-year-old boy, in a video posted online.
Global Affairs Canada has meanwhile confirmed at least one Canadian citizen is dead and two are missing.
Alexandre Look, a 33-year-old from Montreal, was killed at the music festival, his father Haim confirmed to CBC.
""He was just a normal young man trying to enjoy a slice of life in a very normal way.""
Ben Mizrachi, from British Columbia, is among the missing, CTV News reported.
A former federal minister of justice, Irwin Cotler, wrote online that Vivian Silver, 75, a Canadian-Israeli, was ""violently taken from her home in Kibbutz Be'eri"" on Saturday and ""is now being held captive by Hamas in Gaza"".
The peace activist from Winnipeg is the long-time director of the Arab Jewish Center For Empowerment, Equality, and Co-operation, a non-profit that has promoted a shared society for Arabs and Jews throughout Israel.
Foreign nationals from various countries have been confirmed to have died in the attack.More than 10 British citizensare feared dead or missing, an official UK source told the BBC.

"We are broken, says brother of British Hamas victim",,BBC,By Lucy Manning and Jamie Whitehead,"The brother of a British man killed while serving in the Israeli military said his brother ""wanted to keep his people safe"".
Nathanel Young was killed near the Gaza border when Hamas launched its deadly attack on 7 October.
In his first television interview, Eliot Young told the BBC that the family and friends were ""just broken"".
Six British citizens were killed in the Hamas attacks, and a further 10 are missing, PM Rishi Sunak said on Monday.
Nathanel,who was 20 when he was killed, went to Israel two years ago to join the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and ""defend his country"".
""That was what he always wanted to do,"" Eliot said. ""That's what he was here for. But he ultimately came to live here and raise a family and have a life.""
Eliot, who grew up in London but now lives in Israel, said of Nathanel: ""He just loved life. He had a lot of respect for my parents.""
He said that he was known among his friends as a DJ because of his love of music.
Nathanel's funeral on Monday was interrupted by air raid sirens, with mourners sheltering on the floor.
""It was terrifying,"" Eliot said. ""The thing that went through my head is the fact that, even while I'm trying to say goodbye to my brother, they're trying to kill me.""
He added that his parents had travelled from London to Israel to bury their son ""and they had to undergo that"".
""I don't know exactly how they managed that moment, because I'm sure it was very traumatic for them,"" he said.
Nathanel's parents were very proud of him, Eliot said, before recounting a story about the last time he saw his brother ""exactly a week before he was killed"".
""I think if I look back at that day, I remember his infectious smile... this amazing smile,"" Eliot said. ""Whenever I saw him, I always gave him a huge hug. And I will miss that smile. That hug and those laughs that we had together.""
When asked how his family will cope with the loss, Eliot said he did not know how to answer. ""It's still really raw.""
But he said the family had received a lot of support since Nathanel's death, and that ""hundreds of people"" have visited in the last week - on one day three different places delivered them pizza, ""which we then had to find a good home for because we had too much"".
On Monday,Mr Sunak said six British peoplehad been killed in the Hamas attack, and 10 others were still missing. He also called for the immediate release of the 199 people taken hostage by Hamas.
""We stand with you, we stand with Israel,"" the prime minister said to the families of some of the missing watching from the public gallery.

Israeli tanks surround north Gaza's Indonesian Hospital,2023-11-20,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israeli tanks have reportedly encircled Gaza's Indonesian Hospital, where the Hamas-run health ministry said 12 people were killed on Sunday night.
The hospital's director, Dr Marwan Al-Sultan, told the BBC that the post-operative care department was hit and troops were only about 20m (66ft) away.
On Monday evening, he said intermittent shooting could still be heard on site.
The Israeli military said its forces targeted ""terrorists"" who had opened fire at them from within the hospital.
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said he was ""appalled"".
""Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and especially while inside a hospital,"" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra accused Israel of ""tightening its noose"" around the hospital in the north of the enclave, and later told AFP news agency 200 patients had been evacuated by bus to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.
He said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was helping to coordinate the evacuation of the remaining 400 patients.
Meanwhile, 28 premature Palestinian babies evacuated on Sunday from Gaza City's besieged Al-Shifa Hospital, which Israeli forces raided last week, have been transported to Egypt for treatment.
Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza in response to a cross-border attack by hundreds of Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.
Gaza's health ministry says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched its retaliatory campaign against Hamas.
The UN Security Council has called for ""urgent and extended humanitarian pauses"" for ""a sufficient number of days"" to allow UN agencies to safely enter the sealed-off territory.
But five days on, the International Rescue Committee says the killing and suffering of Palestinians has increased, and has urged the Security Council and others to bring about a ceasefire ""without limits on its duration, to protect lives and allow aid to flow"".
On Monday morning, video footage verified by the BBC showed several tanks stationed on a road about 240m (800ft) north-east of the Indonesian Hospital, which is funded by Indonesia.
The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, cited medical sources as saying thatdozens of Israeli armoured vehicles were in the surrounding area and that snipers were on rooftops, preventing ambulances from reaching the hospital.
The health ministry said 12 wounded patients and people with them were killed and dozens more were wounded when an Israeli shell reportedly hit the second floor of the facility.
Dr Al-Sultan told the BBC that he heard gunfire all around the building overnight and that at least 10 people were killed.
Al Jazeera posted a video that the Qatar-based network said showed journalist Anas al-Sharif walking through the hospital following the incident. The body of at least one person could be seen, as well as damage to ceilings and equipment in several rooms and corridors.
Sharif reported that ""victims are piling up on the floor""and that there was ""an overwhelming state of panic among patients"".
Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them.
A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""Overnight, terrorists opened fire from within the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza toward IDF troops operating outside the hospital. In response, IDF troops directly targeted the specific source of enemy fire. No shells were fired toward the hospital.""
""Despite the challenges the IDF faces in a war against a terrorist organisation which operates out of hospitals, the IDF is committed to international law and takes numerous measures to minimize harm to non-combatants.""
Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden said he believed a deal to free hostages in Gaza was close, as the ICRC said its president had travelled to Qatar to meet with Hamas and Qatari government representatives.
US national security spokesman John Kirby said he believed""we're closer than we've ever been, so we're hopeful"".
The ICRC does not take part in negotiations leading to hostage releases but is there to facilitate any deal that is agreed.
That has been the process with the four hostages freed so far - Qatari negotiations with Hamas followed by the ICRC retrieving the hostages from agreed locations and bringing them back to Israel.
Qatar's prime minister has said a deal to free some of the hostages now hinges on ""minor"" practical issues.
On Sunday night,the IDF released new videos from Al-Shifa Hospital, where it has claimed there was a vast underground Hamas command centre.
It said one showed a tunnel leading to a blast-proof door and that two others taken from CCTV cameras showed two hostages - one of them wounded - being taken to the hospital on 7 October.
The IDF also said a pathologist's report and its intelligence had shown a female Israeli soldier whose body was recovered from a building near Al-Shifa last week had been injured in an Israeli air strike and then killed by a member of Hamas inside the hospital.
Hamas has denied using Al-Shifa and other hospitals as shields for its fighters.
At the same time, the WHO has said it was finalising its plans to complete the evacuation of between 250 to 260 seriously wounded or ill patients trapped at Al-Shifa.
""These include around 29 patients with spinal injuries, 22 patients with kidney failure requiring kidney dialysis,"" the WHO's Regional Emergency Director, Dr Richard Brennan, told the BBC.
""The vast majority of the remaining patients have complicated war injuries - terrible fractures and amputations, bad burns, head, abdominal, chest injuries, and many of which are complicated by severe wound infection.""
Thirty-one premature babies were evacuated from Al-Shifa to the Emirates Hospital in southern Gaza on Sunday by the Palestinian Red Crescent and UN, with the assistance of the IDF. At least five other babies had previously died after being removed from their incubators due to a lack of power after the hospital ran out of fuel.
On Monday, 28 of the evacuated babies were taken to Egypt via the Rafah border crossing for treatment. Some are being admitted to the hospital in El-Arish while others in more serious conditions are being flown to Cairo.
Dr Mohamed Salama, head of the neo-natal unit at al-Ahli Emirates hospital, told the BBC thatthe parents of two babies had refused to send them to Egypt ""due to personal circumstances"". A third baby was being kept in Gaza because his condition was stable and his parents were unknown, he said.
Dr Brennan described the evacuation as ""one of the few bits of good news we've had during this conflict"", but noted that the babies had ""a long road ahead of them"" to recover.
In a separate development, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said its clinic in Gaza City came under fire on Monday morning.
""Our colleagues saw that a wall was torn down and part of the building was engulfed by fire as heavy fighting took place all around it. An Israeli tank was seen in the street,"" a statement said.
An MSF member of staff and 20 family members were in the clinic and in extreme danger, while 50 other people were in nearby buildings, it added.
There was no immediate comment from the IDF.

Palestinian fears grow amid rising Israeli settler attacks,2023-08-28,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"There's been a dramatic rise in violence carried out by extremist Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank this year, with more than 100 incidents reported a month according to the UN. It warns that some 400 people have been driven from their land since the start of 2022.
Smashed cars and homes and shops set ablaze. Recent months have seen some of the worst ever scenes of settler violence in the occupied West Bank.
Some have turned deadly.
Posters in remembrance of 19-year-old Qusai Maatan, showing him astride his white Arabian horse, now surround a small roundabout in the village of Burqa, set among olive trees in the rolling hills north-east of Ramallah.
""He had a deeply caring nature. He'd always greet me warmly and check on me in a thoughtful way,"" says his grandfather, Abdul Moneim Maatan, his voice cracking. ""His absence leaves a huge void.""
On the evening Qusai was shot dead by an armed settler, his family say he had gone for a picnic with friends at the edge of the village. Locals describe how a confrontation with radical Israelis living nearby escalated quickly. Stones were thrown and at least one settler opened fire. In an unusually strong rebuke, Israel's closest ally, the US, described what happened here as ""a terror attack.""
Two Israeli settlers and at least five Palestinians were arrested by Israeli security forces, who say they are still investigating the incident.
Settler attacks have become more common, says a young relative of Qusai, who is afraid to give her name.
""No-one knows who the next Qusai is going to be,"" she adds. ""No-one is going to protect us. If, God forbid, there are any other confrontations or attacks, our government can't legally do anything.""
While the Palestinian Authority (PA) governs in big Palestinian cities, Israel retains near exclusive control of 60% of the West Bank (known as Area C), presiding over law enforcement, planning and construction. An estimated 370,000 Palestinians live in Area C, which includes Burqa, and half a million Israeli citizens. Israel's new government, its most right-wing and nationalist to date, has openly declared its intention to double the number of settlers to one million.
Most of the world sees settlements as illegal under international law, though Israel disagrees.
Already 2023 has set an all-time record for settlement construction in the West Bank and for the legitimisation of outposts, according to settlement watchdog Peace Now. Outposts are often set up with a wink and a nod from Israeli authorities but without official permission.
In recent months, the Israeli government - which includes long-time settler activists in key cabinet posts - has completed or begun to legalise 15 settler outposts that were previously illegal under Israeli law, Peace Now says.
What looks like an official signpost leads me to the settler outpost of Oz Zion in an olive grove on a hilltop above Burqa. It was built on privately owned, officially registered land belonging to Palestinians in the village. There is a collection of white, prefabricated buildings, a rudimentary play area for the young children of six families which I am told now live here, and a pen of sheep.
""Our vision is that all of the land of Israel will be settled with Jews. It's our basic right. Our right is in the Bible,"" says Yehuda Lieber, a 26-year-old father of two. He is encouraged by the fact that some of those in government share his ideology and believes that eventually Israel will retroactively authorise his outpost.
""We have an expectation from the government that was elected by right-wing votes to settle the land, expand the settlements, and not hurt them,"" he says.
With a series of new outposts recently set up, he tells me the settlers' strategy is to block Palestinian statehood. Creating an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, is a long-time goal of the internationally backed two-state solution to end the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict.
""What we're doing here and in other places that exist is to halt the establishment of the Palestinian state, which is being built in practice without asking anyone,"" Mr Lieber says.
Anti-occupation groups argue that as settlers have become emboldened by the current Israeli coalition government, settler attacks on Palestinians and their property have risen to a record high. The trend comes against the background of a surge in tensions in the West Bank this year, with near-nightly Israeli military raids and a spate of Palestinian assaults.
It has been the deadliest year for Palestinians and Israelis here for nearly two decades. More than 180 Palestinians have been killed in the territory - mostly fighters, but also many civilians, according to figures collated from PA sources. On the Israeli side, some 32 people have been killed, nearly all civilians - about half in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem.
Some deadly Palestinian militant attacks have led to violent rampages carried out in revenge by settlers, as seen in Huwara in February, following the shooting of two brothers from a nearby settlement, and Turmus Ayya in June, after four settlers were killed outside a petrol station. Both of those assaults left a Palestinian dead. The head of the Israeli Shin Bet domestic security service was recently quoted as warning that the spike in settler attacks was in turn driving Palestinians to attack Israelis saying: ""Jewish terror incites Palestinian terror.""
Official figures from Israel's internal security agency registered a 15% increase in individual Palestinian attacks on civilians and soldiers across Israel and the Occupied Territories in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period last year. In 2022, the agency counted 1,317 uses of fire or pipe bombs, shootings, arson, and stabbings compared to 1,522 in 2023.
Israeli security forces have come under increased scrutiny with the rise in settler violence. They are often criticised for failing to intervene effectively and sometimes for apparently supporting acts of harassment.
The UN's humanitarian agency (OCHA) says it has registered over 700 incidents this year where settler violence has resulted in Palestinian casualties, damage to property or both. The number is the highest since it began recording such acts in 2006.
""Just to give you an idea, in 2021 there was an average of one incident of settler violence a day that we were recording. In 2022, there were two incidents of settler violence and in 2023 we have an average of three incidents of settler violence a day,"" says Andrea De Domenico, head of OCHA in the occupied Palestinian territory.
Mr de Domenico warns that Palestinian Bedouin and other herding communities in Area C are particularly vulnerable.
""We're seeing more and more pressure on Palestinian communities to leave their land,"" he tells me. ""Recently there are three communities that have been completely removed.""
At the start of August, the remaining families from al-Qabun, a herding community in the central West Bank, dismantled their homes and sheep pens to move to safer places. A total of 89 people were forced away, blaming Israeli demolition threats and settler intimidation.
""They used to stop outside our house at midnight and honk their car horns or send kids to harass us. They would scare the sheep and block them in, or empty out our water tank,"" says Ammar Abu Alia.
He worries for the future as he squeezes more than 100 of his flock into a pen on land which he is only able to rent temporarily. ""What will we do?"" he asks. ""We'll be forced to sell. We'll have no livelihood.""
Like the rest of her extended family, Nida Abu Alia - Ammar's sister - is now living in cramped accommodation in a village close to the land they lived on for generations. The mother of nine is bitter about the relative lack of attention paid to her community's plight.
""People said that this is Area C, but that's not right. It's the land of Palestine,"" she says. ""Our displacement is a great loss. People must realise what's happening. If they don't, we will lose a lot.""
Human rights groups warn that the forced transfer of Palestinians from their homes on occupied land could amount to a war crime by Israel, if it is proven that official steps amount to coercion.
At the same time, settlers and their supporters in the Israeli government are seeking to take advantage of the new political reality. Huge investment is planned to expand settlements and improve their infrastructure, cementing a Jewish presence in the West Bank and changing the landscape.
With their own leaders too weak to effect a serious change in course and a sense that settlers enjoy impunity, Palestinian anger and resentment is growing.
The ongoing developments only look set to deepen bitter hostilities.
Correction 26th September: This article originally quoted the US State Department as referring to ""Jewish terror"" and has been amended to make clear that this quote actually came from the Israeli Shin Bet domestic security service.

Mother of Blackpool family stuck in Gaza says nowhere is safe,,BBC,,"A mother-of-four waiting with her family to cross the border into Egypt from Gaza has said ""nowhere is safe"".
Stephanie Abuaassi, originally from Blackpool, Lancashire, moved with her family to Gaza a year ago.
She recalled how they were forced to flee their home at night after Israel launched retaliatory air strikes following Hamas's attack on 7 October.
""We're lucky we had somewhere a bit safer [to move to] but still nowhere is safe,"" she said.
Ms Abuaassi said she hoped her family could cross the Egyptian border at Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip later on Monday.
She explained that she had moved from Blackpool with her husband, who has family in Gaza, in order to learn Arabic, which she says she still does not speak well.
The Gaza Strip only has two other border crossings, both with Israel - Erez, a crossing for people in northern Gaza and Kerem Shalom, a solely commercial goods junction in southern Gaza. Both are now shut.
""We've experienced bombing and planes flying over us, buildings destroyed, all sorts of horrible things,"" she said.
""I hope we get through to Egypt today.""
Ms Abuaassi said her family had temporarily moved into a relative's flat in Khan Younis for a week, where 43 people were staying.
She hopes that the family's British passports will help them get across the border.
""I feel very sorry for the people of Gaza who are not able to leave and are stuck here,"" she said.
""I just hope [there is help for]  these people who have been left behind.
""People now don't have anywhere to live and are homeless. I just hope these people get help.""
One of her children recalled how the family had to run from their home in the middle of the night.
""Many buildings near us had been bombed,"" he said, adding they later found refuge in a hospital.
""In the hospital when I was there, I saw people crying, people's hands broken, women crying.
""I saw someone in shock - they were shaking - from the bombs.""

Israel and Gaza on campus: Tumult at US colleges as two sides dig in,,BBC,By Kayla Epstein,"A debate over the war between Israel and Hamas is raging on US college campuses. In a social media age that demands people pick a side on divisive issues, is there still space for young Americans to talk to each other?
Hundreds of students gathered on the main quad at Columbia University in New York City last week to engage in duelling protests in support of Israel and the Palestinian people - and to condemn the loss of life.
Pro-Israel protesters, most of whom were Jewish, draped themselves in white and blue Israeli flags. For much of the event, they remained silent, letting signs with photos of the victims of Hamas' deadly attack speak for them.
Across the square, students who supported the Palestinians waved signs declaring ""Free Palestine"" and ""End the Occupation"". A female student from Gaza spoke of her mother, trapped by an Israeli blockade.
Though the two sides stood just yards apart, the ideological distance between them seemed insurmountably wide, and only grew more pronounced as the evening progressed.
One of the leaders of the pro-Palestinian demonstration read aloud an open letter published by two student groups at Columbia just a day after Hamas militants rampaged through a music festival and several Israeli towns, killing at least 1,400 people and taking about 150 hostages.
The attack was a ""historic moment for the Palestinians of Gaza, who tore through the wall that has been suffocating them in one of the most densely populated areas on Earth"".
""Despite the odds against them,"" the speaker continued to read, ""Palestinians launched a counter-offensive against their settler-colonial oppressor.""
To these students, the attack on Israel was an important development in the decades-long fight for Palestinian autonomy. And Israel's response in the days since was another example of its indifference to the suffering of the Palestinian people.
More than 2,700 Palestinians in Gaza have died during retaliatory Israeli air strikes, while just over two million people there are trapped by a blockade and cut off from power and clean water.
Israeli officials have used extreme language, with Defence Minister Yoan Gallant referring to Hamas militants as ""human animals"". And the death toll will rise if Israel launches an expected ground offensive.
Most of the activists at Thursday's rally would not speak to reporters. But Darializa Avila Chevilier, who graduated from Columbia in 2016 and had come to support the pro-Palestinian protesters, told the BBC: ""No-one wants violence. What we are saying is the violence will end when there's justice, and people are living with dignity.""
The speakers at the rally condemned the loss of all civilian life and held a moment of silence. But they did not make specific mention of the Israeli victims of violence, or the atrocities carried out by Hamas fighters against civilians, including many women and children.
The protest's organisers, Students for Justice in Palestine, told the BBC in a statement that they oppose any form of violence against innocent civilians and stand ""only for the preservation of life and justice"".
They went on to question ""why an entire nationality—Palestinians—are being made to answer for the actions of [Hamas]"".
Yet many of their Jewish classmates across the lawn heard something else in those speeches: a dismissal of murders perpetrated against their own religious and ethnic minority, which has also faced persecution.
""If you are justifying the murder of innocent civilians, you do not understand human rights,"" one of their posters declared.
Columbia University is not alone in reeling from this political divide.
Student groups at Harvard University issued a statement which blamed Israel's policies for the massacre of its civilians, which prompted a backlash from powerful alumni.
On other campuses across the country, students and schools have received an avalanche of criticism, accused by both sides of either justifying extremism or staying silent in the face of it.
These arguments have played out over decades, but the unprecedented scale of the Hamas attack and Israel's military response means tensions and emotions are spiking.
The current war is the culmination of a shift over the past two decades which has seen hardliners in power in Israel and Gaza, and the prospect for peace via a two-state solution diminish.
""There is a growing gulf, but I think that gulf represents what's going on in Israel and Palestine,"" said Zachary Lockman, a professor at New York University who teaches a course on the history and politics of the conflict and has witnessed many campus debates over the years.
Among students, he said, this translates into ""deepening polarisation, and very little common ground"". And at colleges and on social media, the debate is often framed as 'They're either with us or against us', he explained.
Prof Lockman points out a few trends from the past decade or so that help explain the growing chasm on campus.
First, the Palestinian cause has become more of a priority for left-wing groups in the US. Many activists see a link between the renewed focus in America on social justice and structural racism with Israel's blockade of Gaza and presence in the West Bank.
In the US, critics of the Israeli government are more likely to see the state of Israel - and especially the expansion of Israeli settlements which most of the international community deems illegal - through the lens of colonialism.
Simultaneously, Americans' attitudes towards Israel have shifted along generational lines. Younger people are far more likely to have an unfavourable view of Israel than a favourable one, a July 2022 Pew Research Center poll found.
And a partisan divide has opened up as well. For the first time, Democrats are now more likely likely to feel more sympathy for the Palestinian people, according to Gallup polling, while Republicans are more likely to sympathise with Israel.
Students who back the Palestinian cause argue that while support for their stance may have grown, they believe that pro-Israel sentiment remains strong among America's political, media and academic establishment.
At Thursday's protest, Students for Justice in Palestine condemned Columbia University leadership for not taking a firmer stand in support of the Palestinian people. ""I lied to [my mother],"" a young woman from Gaza told the crowd, ""telling her I was safe at university.""
Back across the quad, the young Jews who attended the rally in support of Israel said they often found themselves frustrated and alienated by the tone of campus debates.
""Even in this liberal university, people cannot respect one another,"" said Lihi Tal, 24, who is studying at Columbia after completing her military service in Israel. ""We're feeling lonely here in the university. There are some people who supports us, but I'm afraid to say that I'm a Jew.""
Other students held strongly partisan stances on the conflict. One Israeli student, Daniel Katz, wandered over to listen to the opposing protest, but found himself unpersuaded. He solely blamed Palestinians for the situation in Gaza before this latest conflict erupted, which human rights groups have called inhumane due to Israel's 16-year blockade.
""They chose [Hamas] to lead, and they betray their own people,"" he said, referring to the 2006 election that brought the militant group to power and is the last election held there.
The signs held by pro-Israel students on Thursday featured many victims of Hamas' attack, but did not display the casualties in Gaza that have mounted as Israel retaliates.
Like their classmates across the lawn, these students also condemned suffering of civilians on both sides, but remained focused on the Israeli and international victims of the terror attack.
A few felt that more nuanced views of the war were being drowned out, and worried that the rhetorical battle lines being drawn would not help students gain a better understanding of the conflict - or each other.
""I think it's very unfortunate, it really saddens me that we're on opposite sides,"" said Stephanie, a 20-year-old Jewish student from Brooklyn who asked the BBC not to reveal her last name.""There's not there's not enough dialogue between these two [groups]. Everything's separate.""
Stephanie had joined the pro-Israel side, but worried that pro-Palestinian classmates were ignoring or misunderstanding the range of Jewish opinion on Israel and its current right government.
""People don't recognise that this group…support Jews and support Israel as a safe haven for them,"" Stephanie said. ""But also, there's diversity of opinion, and that people also support Palestinian life and Palestinian safety.""
Before Thursday's protests, a classmate had approached Stephanie to discuss organising an event where students from opposing sides could talk through the conflict.
""I do believe there is a chance for that to happen, for people to come together in that way,"" Stephanie said. ""I think right now, it's difficult.""

UN agencies reduce Gaza aid operations as fuel runs out,2023-10-26,BBC,By David Gritten,"UN aid agencies say they have begun to significantly reduce their operations in the Gaza Strip because they have almost exhausted their fuel reserves.
Small quantities of fuel retrieved from existing reserves are being used to maintain the water supply in the south, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering from Israeli strikes.
However, they will run out on Thursday.
The agencies say they have reduced their support for overwhelmed hospitals and bakeries feeding the displaced.
""What we are seeing in the Gaza Strip is unprecedented,"" Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, told the BBC.
""Two million people are being strangled. Gaza is being choked with very, very little assistance that is coming from outside.""
Israel began its bombing campaign in Gaza, cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for a cross-border attack by Hamas on 7 October, in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 224 taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 7,000 people have been killed in the territory since then and that its health system is facing total collapse, with a third of hospitals not functioning and the rest only treating emergency cases.
At least 74 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies have crossed from Egypt via the Rafah border crossing since Saturday, which Ms Touma called ""a drop in the ocean of overwhelming needs"". About 500 lorries were allowed into Gaza every day before the start of the war.
Israel refuses to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas, which it classes as a terrorist organisation - as do the UK, US and other powers.
But Ms Touma said Unrwa urgently needed fuel if it was to continue to serve as a lifeline for the 629,000 displaced people taking refuge inside its facilities. Most fled homes in the north of Gaza after being told by the Israeli military to leave for their own safety.
""We're the largest humanitarian organisation and we are on the verge of stopping operations. We are being banned from undertaking the mandate that was entrusted to us by the UN General Assembly. All we're asking to do is to be able to do our work,"" she added.
Dr Abdelkader Hammad, a surgeon at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in the UK who arrived in Gaza to carry out transplants the day before the war began, is sheltering at a UN facility in the southern city of Rafah.
""The situation on the ground is deteriorating day by day,"" he told the BBC.
""People are fighting for the water, for the food, because of the shortages. Whatever they have in the stores is running out now. People are queuing for hours and hours to get some bread from the bakeries which are still working.""
He also expressed alarm about the conditions at the hospitals where he usually performs operations, saying that his colleagues working at them were describing a ""medical disaster"".
""Theatres are full of wounded people. They have to make very difficult decisions about who they treat because they cannot cope with the sheer number of [wounded] people coming,"" he said. ""They are running out of medical equipment. The fuel is running out.""
Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said ina video briefing on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""we don't want hospitals, or the whole of Gaza, to run out of fuel"".
But he advised Unrwa to ask Hamas to hand over some of the hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that the military claims is being stored in a dozen tanks near the border with Egypt.
""There is enough for many days for hospitals and water pumps to run,"" he added. ""Only the priorities are different. Hamas prefers to have all of the fuel for its war-fighting capabilities, leaving civilians without it.""
Asked to comment on the allegation, the UN's regional humanitarian chief, Lynn Hastings, told the BBC: ""We don't have any information about other fuel being available for Hamas to access.""
""I know that is a concern of the Israelis, and quite rightly. It is something that we are trying to address with the Israelis to be able to bring in enough fuel for the humanitarian operations.""
Ms Hastings warned that without fuel for their back-up generators Gaza's hospitals would no longer be able to care for about 1,000 patients receiving kidney dialysis treatment, 130 premature babies in incubators, and intensive care patients on ventilators.
Gaza's water desalinisation and pumping stations would also cease to function, she said.
""There is very, very little clean drinking water available now, which means people are resorting to drinking dirty or salinated water, or both.""
""It also means that the sanitation system is blocked up, because there is no electricity to pump sewage into the sea. We are expecting the streets to have sewage overflow onto them imminently.""
Ms Hastings also complained in a separate statement that the Israeli military was continuing to warn people in Gaza City to evacuate when they had nowhere to go or were unable to move.
""When the evacuation routes are bombed, when people north as well as south are caught up in hostilities, when the essentials for survival are lacking, and when there are no assurances for return, people are left with nothing but impossible choices,"" she warned.
In a statement, the Israeli military accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, and stopping them from evacuating south.
""As we have seen in the past, they use a variety of methods including roadblocks,"" it said.

Gaza-Israel tensions spiral amid closures and clashes,2023-09-28,BBC,By Yolande Knell in Jerusalem & Rushdi Abu Alouf in Gaza City,"In the dark after midnight, it was like rush hour in the northern Gaza Strip.
Thousands of Palestinian workers had heard that Israel was to open its side of the Erez crossing at dawn after 12 days of closure in response to renewed violent protests by the separation fence with Israel in the east of the impoverished territory.
It was the news that Amjad Hassan, a builder who is the sole breadwinner for 13 relatives had been praying for. ""We work on a daily wage, if we don't work, we don't feed our families,"" he explained.
A father-of-five, Nabil said the crossing closure had been ""the greatest disaster"" for him, as he accrued a large debt to the middleman who had arranged his Israeli permit while he was unable to work to pay it off. He had feared losing his coveted permit altogether.
Some 18,000 Gazans are currently authorised to work in Israel, giving them respite from the dire economic situation at home. Dramatic photographs showed many waiting at the crossing point overnight. Some slept in corridors, on the floor, even on a baggage scanner in a reception hall belonging to Hamas, the Islamist militant group which governs Gaza.
After a period of relative calm in Gaza, demonstrations restarted along its boundary fence earlier this month, with hundreds of young Palestinians turning out most days to confront Israeli soldiers. The rallies have been approved, even encouraged, by Hamas.
Protesters have burnt tyres, thrown stones and explosive devices, and released incendiary balloons and kites into southern Israel, which have set fire to farmland and scared Israeli communities living nearby. Some have shot at soldiers, the Israeli military says. It has responded with tear gas and live fire.
One Palestinian at the fence was shot dead by Israeli forces and on another occasion, six were killed, apparently by a malfunctioning Palestinian explosive device.
At one point earlier this week, the Israeli military responded to what it called the ""violent riots"" using a drone, helicopter, and tank to hit several targets in Gaza, including Hamas militant posts. There were no reports of any casualties.
Hamas says that young Palestinians have organised events in response to the tough living conditions in Gaza, which has been under a tight Israeli-Egyptian blockade for the past 16 years, since the group took over the territory. It suggests they have also been motivated by Israeli actions in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the BBC that it was ""a unified picture of a national struggle in all arenas"".
For Omar Shaban, a political economist in Gaza, it is no surprise to see young people turning out by the perimeter fence.
""The situation in Gaza is boiling,"" he says. ""People who go to the border are frustrated by the lack of opportunity. Two thirds of Gazans are aged under 30, who don't have jobs and they can't travel and so they express their anger.""
However, for many Palestinians the demonstrations bring back painful memories of the Hamas orchestrated weekly mass protests between 2018 and 2019, known as the ""Great March of Return"".
Back then, Israeli snipers killed more than 300 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry. Thousands more were injured - with hundreds losing their limbs after being shot. Israel's military said it opened fire at people trying to infiltrate its territory.
On TikTok, powerful videos have been put up by Gazans who were maimed in the earlier rallies and are now urging young people not to go to the new ones.
One amputee claims he was deceived by the organisers five years ago. ""Whenever they feel that people are against them, they rush to send them to the border to vent their anger away from them,"" he says. ""We have nothing in this country. They are the ones making money and we are losing our limbs.""
With the renewal of the protests, albeit on a small-scale, there is a perception that Hamas has been trying to distract attention from its own economic woes but also to gain leverage in indirect talks with Israel, being led by Egypt, Qatar, and the UN.
A senior official, familiar with the negotiations, told the BBC that ahead of the Erez crossing (also known as Beit Hanoun) opening for Palestinian workers, an agreement was reached to stop the demonstrations for two weeks.
However, there are difficult outstanding issues to resolve as Hamas struggles to balance its practical responsibilities as a governing power in Gaza, in the midst of a deep financial crisis, while sticking to its militant ideology.
Just before the unrest by the fence restarted, Hamas announced that it was slashing the wages of its civil servants by half. Recently, Qatar, which helps pay the salaries under the terms of previous ceasefire understandings with Israel, has sent less money, for which Hamas blames Israel.
As part of the indirect talks with Hamas, Israel is understood to be offering more economic privileges if the group freezes its military activities - including carrying out attacks on Israelis in the West Bank.
This follows two shootings last month which killed three Israelis in Hawara and Hebron. On both occasions, Hamas went beyond expressing general support - its usual response - to claim that members of its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, were responsible.
Israeli military commentator Or Heller says there has also been a significant increase in weapons and improvised explosive devices being transferred by Hamas to operatives in the West Bank, which is partly governed by its rivals in the Palestinian Authority.
""We are always seeing with Hamas efforts to maintain relative quiet in 'Hamas-stan', 'the state of Hamas' [in Gaza], and to export the terrorism to the West Bank,"" he notes.
Up to now, Hamas has been refusing to make commitments connected to the West Bank, the BBC understands.
At a military ceremony on Wednesday, Israel's Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, warned that Israel was ready to step up its actions against Hamas in Gaza if necessary, referring to what happened in an Israeli offensive which lasted five days in May and decimated the leadership of a smaller militant group, Islamic Jihad.
""We don't want an escalation [in fighting] and are not looking for a fight, but if we get to the point where we need to act, let 'Operation Shield and Arrow' from a few months ago be a reminder and an example for all terror groups about the capabilities of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], Israel and its security apparatus,"" Mr Gallant said.
During the May operation, some 33 people were killed in Gaza - including at least 12 civilians - and two civilians in Israel, one of whom was a Palestinian labourer.
Back at the Erez crossing, there has been a scramble with Palestinian workers trying to make it out through the rigorous security checks to return to their jobs inside Israel. The crossing is due to temporarily close again this weekend due to the Jewish Sukkot holiday.
The Israeli military's co-ordinator for the Palestinian Territories issued only a brief statement about its intentions. It read: ""Continuation of the civil measures will be possible in accordance with security assessments and with the preservation of stable security.""
Amid the continuing uncertainty, the workers say they are just focusing on support for their loved ones. ""Now my younger brothers can breathe a sigh of relief,"" says Amjad, the builder, ""our lives have been on hold.""

Shani Louk: Mother pleads for help as daughter goes missing at festival,,BBC,By Rachel Russell,"A German mother is pleading for information about her daughter, who she believes was kidnapped by Palestinian militants at a music festival in Israel and paraded through the streets in the back of a pick-up truck.
Shani Louk, who is also a German citizen, had been attending the festival near the Gaza border when Hamas militants stormed the area, opening fire and sending terrified partygoers fleeing through the desert.
Her mother, Ricarda, said she had seen a video of Shani ""unconscious in a car"" after being taken.
Holding up a picture of the twenty-something on her mobile phone, she said in a social media appeal that her daughter had been ""kidnapped with a group of tourists in southern Israel by Palestinian Hamas"".
""We were sent a video in which I could clearly see our daughter unconscious in the car with the Palestinians and them driving around the Gaza Strip,"" she said.  ""I ask you to send us any help or news. Thank you very much.""
As news of Hamas's multi-pronged assault into Israeli territory broke early on Saturday, Ms Louk's family began desperately trying to contact her.
To their horror, they then recognised her in a video being widely shared on social media, showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets in the back of a flatbed truck, surrounded by armed fighters and others yelling ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest).
The woman is lying face down but her family say they identified Ms Louk from her dreadlocks and distinctive tattoos.
""We have some kind of hope,"" her cousin Tom Weintraub Louk told the Washington Post. ""Hamas is responsible for her and the others.""
At least 100 Israeli soldiers and civilians were kidnapped in the Hamas assault, the Israeli government says.
Other people are reported to be missing from the festival,including British citizen Jake Marlowe, although the Israeli embassy in the UK told the BBC it did not know if he had been taken hostage.
His mother told news site Jewish News that he was working as security staff at the festival in Kibbutz Re'im, a community in the city of Ofakim, not far from Gaza.
Videos posted on social media appeared to show an Israeli woman, identified as Noa Argamani, who also attended the event, being kidnapped and held on a motorcycle by two men.
Gili Yoskovich, who also attended, told the BBC thatshe hid under a tree in a field while gunmen went around shooting anyone they could find.
Fighting is ongoing after Israel was hit with a surprise attack by Hamas this weekend.
The Palestinian militants launched a wave of rocket attacks and fighters stormed into Israel on Saturday morning, which have left hundreds dead and thousands more wounded.
Hundreds have also been killed on the other side following Israeli air strikes according to the health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas.

Inside Kfar Aza where Hamas militants killed families in their homes,2023-10-11,BBC,By Jeremy Bowen,"Warning: This article contains details that some readers may find disturbing
Kibbutz Kfar Aza is a microcosm of the first few days of this war, and also a glimpse of what might come next.
Until Tuesday morning, fighting was still going on in the kibbutz, which is one of the Israeli communities along the border with Gaza. That's why only now are they collecting the bodies of its Israeli residents who were killed when Hamas broke through the border wire from Gaza early on Saturday morning.
Soldiers who spent much of the day in the ruins recovering bodies of civilians said that there had been a massacre. It seems likely that much of the killing happened in the first hours of the assault on Saturday.
The Israeli army, caught off guard, took 12 hours to get to the kibbutz, said Davidi Ben Zion, the deputy commander of Unit 71, an experienced team of paratroopers who led the assault.
""Thank God we saved many lives of many parents and children,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, some were burned by Molotov [cocktails]. They are very aggressive, like animals.""
Mr Ben Zion said Hamas gunmen who killed families, including babies, were ""just a jihad machine to kill everybody, [people] without weapons, without nothing, just normal citizens that want to take their breakfast and that's all.""
Some of the victims, he said, were decapitated.
""They killed them and cut some of their heads, it's a dreadful thing to see… and we must remember who is the enemy, and what our mission is, [for] justice where there is a right side and all the world needs to be behind us.""
Another officer pointed to a bloodied purple sleeping bag. A swollen toe poked out. He said the woman underneath had been killed and decapitated in her front garden. I did not ask the officer to move the sleeping bag to inspect her body. A few yards away was the blackened, swollen corpse of a dead Hamas gunman.
Kibbutz Kfar Aza adds to the considerable evidence that is accumulating of war crimes by Hamas gunmen. Like their Israeli neighbours, the community was taken by surprise.
Its first line of defence was the kibbutz guard, residents with military experience who patrolled the perimeter. They were killed fighting the attackers.
Their bodies were removed this morning from their positions in the centre of the kibbutz, and like the other Israeli dead, wrapped in black plastic, carried in stretchers to a parking area and laid in a line waiting to be recovered.
The residents of the Israeli border communities expected periodic rocket attacks after Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. They accepted the danger as the price of country life in a tight knit community which still had traces of the pioneer spirit of early Zionist settlements.
Residents of Kfar Aza, and the other Israeli communities along the Gaza wire, enjoyed a good quality of life, despite the threat from Hamas rockets. In the houses, lawns and open areas of the kibbutz, a concrete shelter was never more than a dash away.
All the houses had reinforced safe rooms. They also had outside terraces, barbeques, swings for the children and fresh air.
But no-one - here in Kfar Aza or elsewhere in Israel - imagined Hamas would be able to breach Israel's defences and kill so many people.
The horror and rage of Israelis has been mixed with incredulity that the state and the military failed in its fundamental duty to protect its citizens.
The bodies of dead Hamas gunmen who killed so many of them have been left rotting in the sun, lying uncovered where they were killed in bushes and ditches and the broad lawns of the kibbutz.
Near their bodies are the motorcycles they used to storm into the kibbutz after they broke through the border wire. The wreckage of a paraglider, used to fly over Israel's defences, is there too, pushed off a path on to a flower bed.
The next common experience with other border settlements was that it took a fierce fight for the Israelis to recapture Kfar Aza.
As we approached the kibbutz entrance this morning, hundreds of Israeli combat soldiers were still deployed along its perimeter. We could hear their radio traffic.
A commander was giving the order to open fire at a building on the Gaza side. Almost immediately bursts of fire from automatic weapons started, directed across the border into Gaza.
The deep thud of airstrikes echoed continually out of Gaza while we were in Kfar Aza.
Israel is suffering a collective trauma after the killing of so many of their fellow citizens on Saturday.
But in Gaza, hundreds of civilians are also being killed. International humanitarian law states clearly that all combatants must protect the lives of civilians.
It is clear that the killing of hundreds of civilians by the Hamas attackers is grave violation of the laws of war. Israelis reject any comparison between the way Hamas kills civilians and the way Palestinian civilians die in their air strikes.
Major General Itai Veruv, who was about to retire when he led the fight to take back the kibbutz, insisted that Israel was respecting its obligations under the laws of war.
""I'm sure we fight for our values and culture… we will be very aggressive and very strong but we keep our moral values. We are Israeli, we are Jewish.""
He denied strongly that they had suspended their obligations under the laws of war. It is certain though that as more Palestinian civilians die, Israel will face stronger and stronger criticism.
That is part of the glimpse of the future afforded by Kfar Aza. So is the attitude of a soldier I spoke to, who didn't want to give his name. Like so many other Israelis, the experience of the first few days of this war, and what he has seen, hardened his resolve to fight.
When they arrived, he said it was ""chaos, terrorists everywhere.""
How difficult, I asked, was the fighting?
""You cannot imagine.""
Have you ever had to do anything like this before as a soldier?
""Not like this.""
What happens next?
""I don't know, I do what they tell me to do. I hope we will go inside.""
Into Gaza? That would be tough fighting.
""Yes. We're ready for it.""
The soldiers were mostly from reserve units. Historically, military service was considered a vital part of nation-building, uniting a country that can be fractious.
Davidi Ben Zion, the officer who led the first wave into the fight for the kibbutz and saw the carnage left by Hamas, acknowledged Israelis had deep political divisions - but insisted they were united now that they were under attack.
A strong smell of decomposing flesh hung in the hot autumn sun of the Mediterranean. Soldiers removing the bodies walked carefully through the ruins of houses, wary of unexploded ordnance, that might also be boobytrapped. A grenade lay on a garden path.
As they worked to recover the bodies, from time to time alerts for Hamas rocket fire made them take cover.
After we left Kfar Aza there were more alerts.

Explosion near Gaza boundary wall kills five Palestinians,2023-09-14,BBC,By Yolande Knell in Jerusalem & Rushdi Abu Alouf in Gaza City,"The funerals have taken place of five Palestinians killed in an explosion in Gaza by the boundary wall with Israel.
Hundreds had joined two rallies at the time of the blast on Wednesday evening.
The Israeli military said there had been ""an attempt by rioters to launch an explosive device"" at its soldiers.
A Palestinian security source told the BBC that a home-made device ""typically used to cause a disturbance by making a very loud, annoying sound"" had exploded as young men were trying to throw it.
More than 20 people were injured, Palestinian medics say.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said protesters had previously thrown explosives and grenades at soldiers.
A grainy black and white video released by the IDF shows the explosion close to a concrete wall, which Israel has built around Gaza, as a small crowd of people runs away.
A graphic Palestinian video seen by the BBC shows a large group of young men about 2m (6.6ft) from the Israeli barrier when there is a powerful explosion which appears to kill some protesters instantly. No Israeli forces are visible.
A witness, Saif Muhareb said he was with a group of some 50 people.
""We found a black object that looked like a camera - 10cm wide and 50cm long. I was towards the back when someone touched it and it exploded.""
Tensions in the area have recently increased after months of relative calm.
Mass protests took place between 2018 and 2019, known as the Great March of Return.
Israeli snipers opened fire at protesters during the weekly demonstrations, killing more than 300 Palestinians and injuring thousands of others, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The Israeli military said it shot at people trying to infiltrate its territory.
One of Wednesday's demonstrations was called by Palestinian political factions - including the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza - to mark the anniversary of Israel's unilateral withdrawal from the strip in 2005.  Another was called to show support for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
On Thursday morning, a small crowd of mourners gathered to carry bodies of those killed in the explosion from Shifa Hospital, in the heart of Gaza City.
Wael al-Zard, a local Hamas leader and preacher at the Grand Mosque, lost his son, 18-year-old Baraa.
""My heart is sad and my eyes shed tears over the loss of my son, the joy of my heart,"" he said.
""But we say, thanks to God, I'm pleased to be the father of a martyr who sacrificed himself for the sake of his homeland. He made me hold my head high.""

Oslo Accords: 30 years of lost Palestinian hopes,2023-09-12,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"It is the 30th anniversary of the breakthrough Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians. The peace deal led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, intended to provide interim self-government for just five years while negotiations solved outstanding core issues in the conflict. Today, nearly a decade after peace talks collapsed, the PA remains in place, but is losing its legitimacy.
With its vibrant restaurants, bustling malls and new construction constantly under way, affluent Ramallah has become synonymous with the Palestinian Authority (PA).
Since 1993 when the first of a pair of agreements known as the Oslo Accords were signed on the White House lawn, foreign donor money has flowed into this West Bank city, north of Jerusalem. Its streets contain smart government ministries with signs and stationery locating them in the State of Palestine.
But Palestinians are acutely aware that this is a facade. As far as Palestinians were concerned, the PA was supposed to be replaced with an elected government, running their own independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with its capital in East Jerusalem. That dream has become ever more distant.
""Things are bad and going backwards,"" Um Nabil, a middle-aged shopper in Ramallah's Manara Square tells me. ""Our lives now are full of instability.""
While opinion polls indicated the Oslo Accords were originally supported by two-thirds of the Palestinian public, the huge optimism it generated has been replaced by deep gloom.
""It's just an overwhelming perception that the Palestinian leadership made a huge mistake some 30 years ago,"" says veteran Palestinian pollster, Khalil Shikaki.
""The belief that the two-state solution is no longer viable is also overwhelming, and that is making people a lot more depressed.""
The reality of life for Palestinians is a grinding military occupation. Whichever way they drive out of Ramallah, they encounter Israeli checkpoints, soldiers, and settlements.
At the time the Oslo Accord was signed in 1993, there were just over 110,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Today, the figure is more than 700,000. Settlements are seen as illegal under international law but Israel has always disputed that.
Now the country has its most hardline ever government - with religious nationalist ministers who advocate annexation of the West Bank.
Meanwhile, the PA - dominated by the Palestinian President's Fatah faction - is weak and lacks initiatives to force Israel to stop expanding on land wanted for a future Palestinian state. It is corrupt and authoritarian and often seen as a tool of Israel's occupation.
There is huge resentment at how PA security forces co-ordinate with the Israeli army to arrest Palestinians allegedly planning attacks against Israelis. Members of the public also note that senior PA officials enjoy large salaries and VIP-style travel permits which ease Israeli restrictions on movement for them and their families. They believe that they use their status to help their allies gain access to such permits, as well as coveted public positions and contracts.
Some 60% of the Palestinian public now see the Authority as a burden, according to Dr Shikaki's surveys. Six months ago, a slim majority even said that its collapse would serve their national interest.
After Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War, its military governors ruled the territories directly. Meanwhile, East Jerusalem was annexed to Israel in a move that was not internationally recognised.
As a result of the Oslo Accords, leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - newly recognised by Israel as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people - returned from exile abroad. The PLO had renounced terrorism and recognised Israel's right to exist in peace.
With Yasser Arafat as president, the newly created PA began to take over basic services such as health, education and policing in Gaza and parts of the West Bank. Some 60% of the West Bank remained under full Israeli control but Palestinians hoped to expand their hold over time.
It only took a few years for progress to come grinding to a halt.  The collapse of peace talks at Camp David in 2000 was followed by Palestinian fury when Israel's opposition leader visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site - the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount - seeking to promote Israeli sovereignty there.
The deadly violence of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, then left the peace process in tatters and strengthened the hawkish Israeli right-wing. Although negotiations were later brokered by the US, they achieved little; the last round fell apart in 2014.
In his comfortable office in Ramallah, I meet Sabri Saidam, a former PA education minister who is now deputy secretary general of the Fatah Central Committee. He rejects the idea that the Authority is ineffective, describing its creation as ""a milestone."" His message is that propping it up preserves the possibility of the two-state solution - the international formula for peace.
""It is not the finale, yet it reflects an achievement the Palestinians would like to preserve,"" he says, spelling out how the PA has helped consolidate a Palestinian identity, established institutions, reinforced law and order and taken on tens of thousands of public workers.
With the cash-strapped PA currently struggling to pay full salaries to employees, Dr Saidam urges crisis-weary international donors to step up, raising the spectre of chaos and collapse otherwise.
Undermining the legitimacy of the PA is its steady drift towards autocracy. Presidential elections brought Mahmoud Abbas to power for a four-year term in 2005, but now 87 years old, as the head of the PA and PLO, he continues to serve by his own decree overseeing an increasingly broken system.
The last parliamentary elections held in 2006 were won by Fatah's bitter rival, the Islamist party, Hamas, which is committed to the destruction of Israel. Efforts to form a unity government that the world could accept ultimately failed and in 2007, Hamas seized full control of Gaza, after days of deadly inter-factional fighting. It continues to rule there and the damaging internal political rift persists. Parliament remains suspended.
While criticising the PA - even on social media - is increasingly risky, those who do speak out argue that today it has become preoccupied with its own survival and maintaining benefits for its leaders.
""It's the opposite of self-determination and self-government,"" complains Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and former spokesperson for the PLO. ""It's become a dictatorship and rule by those who are unelected, with no real connection to any political process.""
Today, Palestinians aged under 35 have never voted in a general election. Ms Buttu and others call for new elections and a definitive push by world powers to force Israel out of occupied territory.  However, foreign players seem unwilling to take bold steps.
Back in the heart of Ramallah, the legacy of Oslo shapes the rhythms of daily life as PA workers leave their offices and pupils from government schools head home.
But people of all ages are worried. There is a looming fear of internal strife when the PA's unpopular, elderly president finally leaves the political stage without a clear successor, and then the stress of the daily news.
A woman in her 20s recounts how two brothers from her village were killed on the same day by Israeli troops during an incursion late last year. ""Their poor mother received the news like a thunderbolt,"" she says.
A shopkeeper, Abu Saleh, will not let his four sons leave the city. ""I'm afraid of crossing paths with the Israeli army and settlers,"" he explains. He no longer visits his brother living an hour's drive away in Nablus.
Recent months have been the bloodiest in the West Bank for years with regular Israeli military raids, a series of shootings by Palestinian militants and growing violence by extremist settlers. Some pockets of the West Bank - particularly in the flashpoints of Nablus and Jenin - have fallen outside the PA's control.
The loss of faith in PA leaders has boosted militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad still committed to armed struggle against Israel and led to the creation of new, more localised groups.
""We're so tired,"" sighs the young woman in Ramallah, summing up the general mood. ""We just want this conflict to end."" Yet three decades on from a landmark deal, there is no end in sight.
While there is real frustration at today's PA - its international role now entangled with that of the PLO - that is compounded by a sense that it also controls the only real mechanisms for any paths to progress in achieving peace.

Palestinian workers return to Gaza after expulsion from Israel,2023-11-03,BBC,,"Crowds of workers from Gaza have been returning to the Palestinian territory after Israel expelled thousands of them and vowed to refuse any new permits.
Gaza is facing constant bombardment and acute shortages of key supplies.
The UN voiced its concerns for the workers' safety in the ""incredibly difficult and dangerous situation"".
Before the war, more than 18,000 Palestinian workers were allowed to cross from Gaza into Israel and the occupied West Bank.
Israel suspects Hamas, which runs Gaza, may have got information about the places it attacked on 7 October from Gazans working on the kibbutzes.
Israeli media reports quote intelligence sources who suggest that the layouts of individual homes in these communities - and the proximity of Israeli defences - were among details that might have been passed on.
The unprecedented assault on southern Israel by Hamas almost four weeks ago killed more than 1,400 people. The Israeli military says that 242 others were abducted and are being held hostage in Gaza.
In the wake of the attack, Israel launched an aerial campaign campaign and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian enclave. The Gazan health ministry, run by Hamas, says more than 9,000 people have been killed.
The crossings to Gaza were also closed as Israel stepped up its blockade, which has left Palestinian labourers stranded in Israel for weeks.
Announcing the expulsion of workers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu restated his aim to cut all ties with Gaza.
A post on X, formerly known as Twitter, from his office went on to say: ""There will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza. Those workers from Gaza who were in Israel on the day of the outbreak of the war will be returned to Gaza.""
Israeli officials have not said how many of these people were in Israel on the day Hamas launched its deadly attacks.
The jobs held by the Gazans - in sectors like agriculture or construction - commanded salaries up to 10 times what a worker could earn in Gaza, according to the Reuters news agency.
Crowds of men were pictured on Friday using the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel into Gaza, which is normally used for goods only.
The checkpoint is east of the Rafah border crossing - between Gaza and Egypt - through whicha limited number of people have been able to leave Gaza since Wednesday.
Some of those who spoke to Reuters at Kerem Shalom said they had been detained and mistreated by Israeli authorities after the Hamas attacks.
The UN's human rights office said it was ""deeply concerned"" that ""at least 4,000 Palestinian workers and hospital patients were detained without sufficient legal basis"" when Israel revoked their work permits after the events of 7 October.
The BBC has approached Israeli authorities for comment on the alleged mistreatment of Gazan workers in detention.
A UN spokeswoman also said it was ""worrying"" that some Palestinians were being sent back to Gaza ""despite the gravity of the situation there"". She said it was not clear whether some of the affected people even had a home to return to.

"In Kibbutz Be'eri, a broken promise to keep Israelis safe",2023-10-31,BBC,By Lucy Williamson,"Kibbutz Be'eri - three miles from Gaza - never felt like the frontline of a conflict.
It looks like one now. Its empty streets are a canvas of rage.
In the house where seven members of Gilad Korngold's family were taken hostage by Hamas, it's hard to find any sign or scrap of family life.
Machine-gun fire has gouged holes across the walls; rooms are collapsed and gutted by fire; bullets have made lacework of the metal doors.
""Look at this!"" Gilad cries, holding back tears, as we walk inside. ""How they hate us.""
The safe-room door held fast against the bullets, but the steel shutters outside were blown open, and his family has gone. Among them are his son Tal, daughter-in-law Adi, his eight-year-old grandson Naveh and three-year-old granddaughter Yahel.
It's the first time he's seen the house, which belongs to Adi's parents, since the attack.
""It'll take generations to rebuild [the kibbutz], if they build a new one,"" he told me. ""I think a lot of people will not return.""
What was broken here was not just the houses, but the promise Israel made to its people that it could keep them safe, even three miles from a territory run by a group committed to Israel's destruction.
""It was an illusion,"" said Gilad. ""For 25 years, a long illusion. This is what everybody thought: we were safe here, we were strong. But after this happened, I hope somebody will wake up and start another strategy.""
Standing in the empty house, the twin pressures on Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are clear.
Both Mr Netanyahu and his armed forces have a tough task ahead to rebuild trust in Israel's ability to protect its people.
At the same time, public pressure is growing on the government to secure the return of more than 200 hostages held in Gaza, including Gilad's son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren.
With backroom negotiations reportedly continuing, Hamas has suggested it could release the hostages in return for all Palestinian prisoners held in Israel's jails.
Many relatives, including Gilad, say that Israel should do whatever it takes.
But the man Israel holds responsible for this attack - the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar - was himself released in a prisoner exchange deal 12 years ago.
Mr Netanyahu faces a difficult decision: whether or not to gamble with the country's future security in order to get the hostages out now.
He has already facedchallenging conversations with the families of some hostagesover Israel's intense bombardment of Gaza, insisting that there is no conflict between the government's two priorities of destroying Hamas and protecting the hostages.
""The key is the degree of pressure,"" he told the families last week. ""The greater the pressure, the greater the chances.""
But many families need convincing.
Gilad said he and his family had sat up all night last week when Israel escalated its air strikes on Gaza, watching for any news of the hostages there.  It was ""a terrible night"", he said.
Public attitudes seem to be shifting behind the hostage families. More people are joining the rallies organised by them after a widespread media campaign.
And a poll by a major Israeli paper just before the ground invasion of Gaza suggested that less than a third of people supported it, down from more than two-thirds a week before.
During that time, Hamas released four hostages, drip-feeding them out two by two. The unspoken message planted in many minds here was that there could be more.
But early indications suggest that public opinion on whether to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange is deeply divided.
The government's war aims have sparked a startling national unity over the past few weeks. Could the methods used to achieve them prove more divisive?
At the families' memorial site in Tel Aviv, a new clock is ticking up the hours of the hostages' captivity. Its bright digits tick on through daytime speeches and candlelit vigils relentlessly.
Around it, posters of those taken hostage by Hamas paper every wall - frozen, along with their families, in the final messages or moments from three weeks ago.
Meanwhile, Israel has changed irrevocably.
In Be'eri, the sounds of Israel's continued bombardment of Gaza land in the empty streets every minute or two.
Cradled in the ashy scraps of garden, Gilad spots his grandson's football - preserved untouched beneath a layer of gritty soot.
The buried treasure of an earlier life.

Israel recalls diplomats from Turkey in Gaza row,,BBC,By Jemma Crew,"Israel has recalled diplomats from Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused it of behaving like a ""war criminal"".
He made the comments while addressing thousands of demonstrators at a pro-Palestinian rally in Istanbul.
The Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen responded by ordering diplomats to return.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has ""the most moral army in the world"".
Israel has expanded its strikes on the Gaza Strip, three weeks after Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 229 people hostage.
Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 7,500 Palestinians have been killed as Israel carries out retaliatory strikes.
Addressing a crowd of several hundred thousand Palestinian supporters on Saturday, the Turkish president said ""the main culprit behind the massacre unfolding in Gaza is the West"".
""Israel has been openly committing war crimes for 22 days, but the Western leaders cannot even call on Israel for a ceasefire, let alone react to it,"" he said.
He accused Israel of behaving like a ""war criminal"" and accused it of trying to ""eradicate"" Palestinians.
He continued: ""Of course, every country has the right to defend itself. But where is the justice in this case? There is no justice - just a vicious massacre happening in Gaza.""
It follows posts from the Turkish leader earlier on Saturday on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which he said the latest escalation had targeted ""innocent civilians"" and worsened Gaza's humanitarian crisis, adding: ""Israel must immediately stop this madness and end its attacks"".
Moments after President Erdogan finished his remarks at the rally, Israel's Foreign Minister Mr Cohen said on X: ""Given the grave statements coming from Turkey, I have ordered the return of diplomatic representatives there in order to conduct a re-evaluation of the relations between Israel and Turkey.""
Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu later said: ""Don't accuse us of war crimes. If you think that you can accuse our soldiers of war crimes that is hypocrisy. We are the most moral army in the world.""
He added the Israel Defense Forces is taking precautions to protect civilians, and accused Hamas of committing crimes against humanity by ""using their people as human shields"".
The two countries have a history of tense relations.
Once close allies, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel in 2010 after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.
Relations were restored in 2016, but they expelled each other's top diplomats in 2018 in a dispute over Israel's killing of Palestinians amid protests on the Gaza-Israel border.
Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organisation - unlike countries including the US and UK. It has long hosted its members and supports a two-state solution.

"Nathanel Young, British man serving in Israeli military, killed in Hamas attack",2023-10-08,BBC,By Oliver Slow,"A British man serving with the Israeli military has been killed in an attack by Hamas militants, his family says.
Nathanel Young had been serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was killed on the Gaza border on Saturday.
The 20-year-old's brother, Eliot Young, said Nathanel had been ""the life of the party"" and was ""loved by everyone"".
Two other British citizens - Jake Marlowe and Dan Darlington - are missing in Israel following Saturday's attacks by Palestinian militants.
Mr Young's brother Eliot said: ""Nathanel was full of life and the life of the party.
""He loved his family and friends and was loved by everyone.""
He said Mr Young ""loved music and was a talented DJ"" and ""always had strong Jewish pride"".
The soldier was a ""bubbly guy who his four nieces loved playing with"", his brother added.
""When Nathanel could have taken his days off to sleep and re-energise, he instead found out where the family was, which wasn't always so close to him, and came to join us,"" his statement continued.
In a separate statement on Facebook, Mr Young's family said: ""We're heartbroken to share that our little brother Nathanel Young was tragically killed on the Gaza border yesterday.""
Mr Young was a former pupil at JFS, a Jewish school in Kenton, north London, the British newspaper Jewish News reported.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his thoughts were with Mr Young's family, as well as ""all those whose families and communities have been touched by this terrible violence"".
""Labour stands firmly in support of Israel's right to defend itself, rescue hostages and protect its citizens,"" he said. ""The indiscriminate attacks from Hamas are unjustifiable and have set back the cause of peace.""
Sir Keir added that ""we will all stand firm against any intimidation or harassment directed towards Jewish communities here in Britain"".
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had assured Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu of the UK's ""steadfast support as Israel defends itself"".
""We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail,"" he added.
Mr Sunak said the government was now working to establish the status of UK citizens in Israel, as he knows there will be ""families who are anxious about their loved ones"".
Earlier, the Israeli Embassy in London confirmed London-born Mr Marlowe, 26, was missing and it was not known whether he had been taken hostage.
Mr Marlowe, who went to the same London school as Mr Young, was working as security staff at an outdoor party near the Gaza border when he disappeared on Saturday.
His mother toldJewish Newsthat she had spoken to him as the attacks were taking place.
""Then, at about 5.30am, he texted to say, 'signal very bad, everything OK, will keep you updated I promise you,' and that he loves me,"" she said.
She told the paper he lived in Ma'alot, in northern Israel, having moved to the country permanently two years ago.
The family of Mr Darlington also confirmed he was missing, telling the BBC they had not spoken to him since Saturday morning.
The photographer is originally from the UK but lives in Berlin, Germany, and had been visiting friends in Israel.
David Darlington, his father, said his son had been travelling with a German woman, and that his half-sister had last spoken to him on Saturday morning.
""The communications network is down and we haven't spoken to him for 24 hours,"" he said.
Saturday's surprise attack by hundreds of gunmen from Hamas has killed more than 700 people in Israel, according to Israel's Defense Forces.
Hundreds of gunmen entered southern Israel, killing soldiers and civilians and taking into Gaza what the army said was a ""significant number"" of hostages.
Attendees of the music event near Kibbutz Re'im, where Mr Marlowe was working, have spoken of howgunmen opened fire at revellers in the early hours.
One attendee, Gili Yoskovich,told the BBCthat she hid under a tree in a field as gunmen roamed around, shooting anybody they found.
The UK's Foreign Office said it was ""in contact with - and assisting - the families of several individuals"" in Israel and the Palestinian territories.
A spokesperson said they were aware of media reports regarding British nationals but would not discuss individual cases.

IDF releases CCTV it says shows Hamas bringing hostages to al-Shifa hospital on 7 October,2023-11-20,BBC,,"The Israeli military have released CCTV footage which it says shows Hamas bringing hostages, who were abducted on 7 October, to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza.
The video, which has not been verified by the BBC, appears to show two hostages being brought into the hospital. Armed men can also be seen in the footage.
In one clip, one of the hostages is being brought into the hospital main entrance. In another clip a wounded man is is shown on a stretcher.
IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, who presented this footage, says it is ""concrete evidence"" of Hamas taking hostages to al-Shifa hospital.
The IDF has been under pressure to substantiate its claim that Hamas operated an expansive command centre underneath the vast medical complex in the north of the territory.
The Israeli military says the footage ""clearly proves that numerous buildings in the hospital's complex are used by Hamas as cover for terrorist activities"".
Hamas has denied these allegations.

Israelis and Palestinians fear worst to come after Gaza violence,,BBC,By Jeremy Bowen,"In the last few days I have been in southern Israel close to the border with Gaza, deep in the West Bank with hard-line Jewish settlers, and seen the funeral of two young Palestinian men killed by the Israeli army in a raid on a refugee camp.
I've spoken to a former Israeli leader in his office in a Tel Aviv high rise, and a senior Palestinian official in his office in a villa in Ramallah. I have heard an Israeli father at a vigil in Tel Aviv describe how his daughter's birthday cake was still in the fridge when his wife and three young children were taken by Hamas gunmen as hostages.
What I have not been able to do is enter Gaza. Only small convoys of aid, and a handful of Israeli combat troops on raids and reconnaissance, have been able to do that.
More Palestinians and Israelis have been killed in the last two and a half weeks or so than in the entire second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, that lasted from 2000 until it petered out around the end of 2004.
Among the different people I've met, Palestinians and Israelis as well as foreigners, I have had a single clear impression. A sense that the grim old routines that have settled on this long conflict since the end of the last intifada have been swept away by the enormity of events since 7 October, and replaced with a fear that what comes next will be even worse.
The occupied Palestinian territories consist of Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israel captured them, along with the Golan Heights which it took from Syria, in the 1967 Middle East war.
It was the most sweeping and rapid victory in Israel's history, achieved in only six days. Coming 19 years after Israel's independence war of 1948, which Palestinians call the catastrophe, or al-Nakba, the 1967 war created the cockpit in which the conflict as it stands today is fought.
Like many others who follow the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians I have felt for the last few years that a major explosion was coming.
On 14 May 2018, I thought that might have started, during the terrible violence that accompanied President Donald Trump's decision to move the embassy of the United States from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
President Trump rejected the international convention that Jerusalem's status was unresolved, as both Israel and the Palestinians claim it as a capital. He sided with Israel. Most of Israel's other allies, including the United Kingdom, still have their embassies in Tel Aviv.
As the president's daughter Ivanka Trump opened the embassy, broadcasters split their screens to show terrible violence on the border wire between Israel and Gaza.
Israeli soldiers shot to kill as thousands of Palestinians demonstrated near the fence in what was called ""the great march of return"" by Hamas. Some of them tried to pull the fence down. Some 59 Palestinians were shot dead and thousands more wounded. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, supported by the US, said any country would repel an attack on its border.
The next day was much calmer.  A few weeks later the routines of the conflict were re-established. Benjamin Netanyahu, and his allies in the Trump administration, were able to congratulate themselves that the Palestinians had been contained.
Perhaps that was the moment that Hamas started planning a much more devastating way to breach the border and attack Israel, which culminated in the 7 October attacks.
Benjamin Netanyahu's decision - supported by the Americans - to allow the conflict to fester, in the mistaken belief that Israel could keep a lid on it while attending to more important matters, turned out to be a strategic error of monumental proportions.
I walked up the stone staircase to the office of Sabri Saidam in Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital of the West Bank. He was educated at Imperial College, London, is an adviser to President Mahmoud Abbas and is a senior member of Fatah, the faction once led by Yasser Arafat that dominates the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Mr Abbas heads the Palestinian Authority, which was created in the Oslo peace process of the 1990s as a government in the making for an independent state. Now it is at best a job creation scheme with municipal functions, at worst a symbol of inefficiency and corruption. Abbas has not put himself up for re-election since 2006.
Sabri Saidam said they had warned the Americans over Benjamin Netanyahu's belief that he could manage the Palestinians while trying, with American help, to normalise relations with the rich Gulf Arab oil monarchies.
""A reaction was coming. It was in the pipeline. Nobody knew what was the scale and the shape of it. But we have told the Americans many times in meetings that the Palestinians would react and don't leave matters hanging in the balance. You have to intervene. You have to be serious about the peace process.""
He rejected the suggestion that Hamas was using people as human shields and now, he said, Israel is engaged in ""genocide"".
The peace process is shorthand for the years of ultimately failed negotiations that were supposed to end the conflict by creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel. That is the ""two-state solution"" that President Joe Biden, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, President Emmanuel Macron and other dignitaries who have been here in the last few weeks have said once again is the only realistic solution.
The trouble with that is that there is no peace process - the Americans last tried, and failed, to revive it ten years ago under President Barack Obama - and the two-state solution has become an empty slogan.
I went to see the former Prime Minister Ehud Barak in his glass-walled office in a tower in Tel Aviv. In 1973, as a young special forces commander, he planned and led an audacious raid on Lebanon, which they called Operation Spring of Youth. Barak was disguised as a woman, with make-up and a blonde wig, as he led an assassination team that slipped into Beirut to devastating effect.
Mr Barak went on to command the Israeli military and was prime minister from 1999-2001 and later served as defence minister under Benjamin Netanyahu, who in turn had been a junior officer in his special forces unit, the Israeli equivalent of Britain's SAS.
Since then, Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu have become political enemies. Barak has blamed Netanyahu for mistakes that left Israel vulnerable to Hamas. He believes the prime minister's long years in office will end once the army deals with Hamas.
""Winning the war,"" Mr Barak told me, ""will take time and then the torrent of sweat and decent blood is not going to be something simple… when it's over or half over or there is a situation of whatever kind it would be a volcano of rage, it will erupt, I believe. To remove this government from power.""
One reason for Mr Netanyahu's reluctance, up to now anyway, to send ground troops into Gaza is the presence of more than 200 hostages, mostly Israeli civilians. Hamas took them to put pressure on Israel and is succeeding.
Releasing four hostages and talking about freeing many more has become an effective tactic in the psychological war between the two sides. Voices in Israel are getting louder, demanding a halt to any invasion plans until the hostages are free.
Ehud Barak, who believes Israel has to send troops into Gaza to eliminate Hamas, said that hard choices lie ahead for Prime Minister Netanyahu and his war cabinet.
""If there is no other way, we will have to do it, because the alternative is to provide those barbarians and terrorists who made crimes against humanity [with] impunity due to the fact that they massacred, slaughtered probably 1,500 people…  A very painful and tough decision might have to be made.""
I drove through the West Bank over two days this week, and saw an area that was extremely tense, with Israel in tight control. Thousands of soldiers in combat gear have sealed off Palestinian villages, set up roadblocks and are protecting Jewish settlements, which are regarded as illegal under international law although Israel disputes this.
In an isolated settler outpost on a desolate hilltop outside Hebron, hard line Jewish nationalists carrying weapons told me they were waiting for the chance to use them against Palestinians. Their leader Meir Simcha, who walked round the outpost armed with a large machete in a leather scabbard, said that unlike other Israelis they had not been surprised by the Hamas assault on 7 October. It was a shame, he said, that so many Jews had to die to show mainstream Israel something he believed was self-evident.
""In a war you have a gun and a trigger,"" Simcha said. ""And for those who don't understand yet, we are at war. A war where the other side shows no mercy and we need to do the same. There's no choice.""
Further north in the West Bank, the atmosphere in Jalazone refugee camp, just outside Ramallah, was sombre, fearful and angry, as two young men killed in an Israeli army arrest operation were buried. Mustapha al-Ayan - cousin of Mahmoud Seif, one of the dead men who was shot as he threw stones at the Israelis - said the army had not come to arrest suspects but to punish them for what Hamas did on 7 October.
The grave was being filled behind him as he told me: ""They are coming to the West Bank to take revenge, because the resistance groups in Gaza have hurt them. So now they are attacking the people in the West Bank. God give mercy to all the martyrs in Gaza and the West Bank.""
One fear often expressed by Palestinians is that Israel, in its rage, is using the crisis to try to inflict another Nakba, or catastrophe, on the scale of 1948. The evidence they cite is the way that more than a million Gazans have been forced to flee to the south of the Strip, and the threats made by some Israeli politicians to make Gaza smaller by taking tranches of land to use as buffer zones.
In Ramallah, Sabri Saidam, the Fatah official, talked about a map that Mr Netanyahu produced at the United Nations in September, showing an Israel that included the West Bank and Gaza.
""Everybody has in mind that the very map that Netanyahu carried before the nations at the General Assembly of the UN, in which there was no West Bank and Gaza. So the feel and general mood is actually entertaining the thought that Netanyahu is going after the deportation, the displacement of Palestinians leading up to the annexation of Gaza.""
The ghosts of the past shape the mood on both sides. For Israel it is the Holocaust of European Jews at the hands of Nazi Germany. The massacres on 7 October have been called the worst day for the Jews since the Holocaust. The word ""selection"", that was used to describe the way Jews arriving at death camps were either sent straight to the gas chambers or spared to be worked to death, has been applied to suggestions that deals might be done that release foreign hostages before Israelis.
Palestinians don't share much with Israelis, especially not now, except the shadow of the past and a dread of harder times ahead.

How would an Israeli ground assault on Gaza unfold?,2023-10-13,BBC,By Jonathan Beale,"Israel appears to be preparing for a ground invasion into Gaza.
Its military is telling 1.1 million people in the north of the strip to relocate south in the next 24 hours. Meanwhile it is massing tens of thousands of troops, tanks and artillery on the edge of the territory.
But sending ground forces into Gaza's densely populated urban areas is an operation fraught with peril.
The scope of a potential ground assault is also still not clear - how far would the incursion go and for how long?
The choreography necessary for a ground assault has started.
Major General Amos Gilead, a veteran of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and previous operations inside Gaza, says the first task for Israel was to create a unity government to get public backing for what happens next.
Recent high level diplomatic visits by senior US and European politicians have allowed Israel to shore up international support, though that solidarity could waver the longer this war goes on and as civilian casualties mount. Significant Israeli military casualties in any military operation will also test its own resolve.
As for military preparations, Israel has already massed its forces near the border with Gaza. Some 300,000 reservists have been activated, alongside a standing force of more than 160,000.
We talked to some of the recently arrived reservists in the south - their morale appears to be high, and they're ready to fight.
Nissim was in Sri Lanka when he first heard the news of the Hamas attack, but took the first plane back to Israel to join his unit. ""This is our home. We have to fight for it,"" he says.
Shuki left his sales job straight away. ""We would love to have peace,"" he told me. ""Unfortunately, that's not possible. We enjoy life, so we need to fight for the right to live.""
Israel seems united in the need for action, but the clock is ticking while they await their battle orders. The longer troops wait, the harder it will be to maintain readiness and morale.
Israel's warning to Palestinians living in Gaza to flee south is an indication that the next phase of its military operation is imminent.
Israel's first task was to secure its own territory and to kill, or capture and interrogate Hamas fighters who crossed the border and killed more than 1,300 people and kidnapped at least 150.
Israel's already been conducting intense air strikes targeting Hamas' military hierarchy and infrastructure. Over the past six days its air force has dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza. As a comparison, Nato allies released 7,700 during the entire war in Libya in 2011.
More than 1,500 people have been killed in Gaza in the air strikes so far.
Plans for the invasion itself will be a closely guarded secret, but Israel has been getting ready for years. It's been training troops in a multi-million dollar urban warfare centre in the south, dubbed mini-Gaza.
There they have learnt how to fight through a maze of tightly packed buildings and tunnels, of which Hamas is believed to have built more than 1,000.
Yaakov Katz, a former editor of the Jerusalem Post and the author of several books on Israel's military, says the military has been configured to operate for this very purpose in specialist brigades - combining engineers with armoured bulldozers working alongside tanks and infantry.
Major General Yaakov Amidror - a former IDF commander and national security advisor - acknowledges that fighting Hamas will be tough. Hamas will have laid booby traps and Improvised Explosive Devices at entrance points and along narrow streets, he says.
Israel believes Hamas has around 30,000 troops. Their weapons include automatic rifles, rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles - some of Russian origin like Kornets and Fagots.
Hamas also still has large stockpiles of rockets which they've been firing into Israel. Yaakov Katz says Hamas has also been producing its own small drones - including suicide ones. He says Hamas may also have a very limited supply of short-range shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles. What they do not have is armoured vehicles, tanks and artillery - unlike Israel.
But the challenge for Israel will be close-quarters fighting in densely populated urban areas.
Israel has specialists teams for tunnel warfare, including an engineering unit called Yahalom, and Oketz which specialises in canine combat.
Mr Katz says Israeli troops will avoid going into tunnels unless they have to, not least because Hamas will know them better. Instead tunnels will be destroyed by pouring down explosives.
The fate of the hostages taken from Israel complicates any ground assault.
Maj Gen Gilead was involved in the negotiations which eventually led to the release of an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas for five years from 2006 to 2011. He was eventually exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.
Maj Gen Gilead says while the military will need to take their fate into consideration, ""if we don't do something concrete, we might find ourselves with more challenging problems"".
But Maj Gen Amidror says the hostages will not prevent any action. ""We will fight Hamas to the end and we will have to find those hostages during the operation.""
Israel's stated goal is to destroy Hamas.
Maj Gen Gilead, who served in the IDF for 30 years, says that goes beyond previous Israeli operations inside Gaza, which were ""mainly about containment"".
This time he says ""we need to do something far more dramatic"". Decisive military action he believes would also deter Israel's other enemies in the region - namely Hezbollah and Iran.
Mr Katz believes Israel's goals will be more pragmatic - making sure that Hamas never has the military capability to attack Israel again. He says Israel ""doesn't want to re-occupy Gaza, and have to take care of two million people who are hostile to it"".
However, recent history suggests invasions very rarely go according to plan.
Even the world's most advanced militaries can soon get bogged down - look at what happened to the US in Iraq and Afghanistan, and more recently Russia in Ukraine.
A military operation inside Gaza, which is only 25 miles (40 km) long, is not on that scale, but the outcome is far from clear, says Lieutenant General Sir Tom Beckett of the Institute of Strategic Studies.
""In truth, there are no good options for an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza. No matter how successful the operation proves in defeating Hamas as a military organisation, Hamas's political imperative and the population's support for the resistance will continue.
""Israel either reoccupies Gaza to control it or, by withdrawing after an offensive, cedes ground to people for whom the resistance is existence.""

"Saudi prince slams Hamas, Israel and the West",2023-10-20,BBC,By Frank Gardner,"A speech made by Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia this week on the current violence in the Middle East is unusually frank for a senior member of the Saudi royal family.
It has been widely acknowledged as the clearest indicator yet of the Saudi leadership's thinking on the situation.
Prince Turki, a widely respected elder statesman in Saudi circles, has publicly condemned both Hamas and Israel for attacking civilians, following Hamas's 7 October attack on southern Israel and the subsequent Israeli bombardment of Gaza. There were no heroes, he said, only victims.
Such is the groundswell of Arab anger at those Israeli air strikes that Prince Turki, who was addressing a US audience at Rice University in Houston, is a rare Arab voice of criticism of Hamas in the current climate.
The group's acts, he said, went against Islamic injunctions not to harm civilians. The majority of those killed or kidnapped by Hamas were civilians.
Prince Turki, a careful, thoughtful ex-diplomat and spy chief, balanced his condemnation of Hamas with that of Israel, which he accused of ""indiscriminate bombing of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza"" and the ""indiscriminate arrest of Palestinian children, women and men in the West Bank"".
He took issue with the US media's use of the phrase ""unprovoked attack"" in reference to the 7 October raid, saying: ""What more provocation is required.. than what Israel has done to the Palestinian people for three-quarters of a century?""
He added that ""all militarily occupied people have a right to resist occupation"".
Prince Turki also condemned Western politicians for ""shedding tears when Israelis are killed by Palestinians"", but refusing to ""even express sorrow when Israelis kill Palestinians"".
President Joe Biden has since said, during his visit to Israel, that the US mourned all innocent victims.
So what lies behind this speech, which the prince must have known would be widely reported?
It is unlikely that he would have spoken without first checking in with his country's Royal Court, run by the all-powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who held talks with Rishi Sunak on Thursday.
Prince Turki has quite a pedigree. His father was the popular and modernising King Faisal, who was assassinated in 1975. His brother was Saudi Arabia's longstanding foreign minister until his death in 2015.
Prince Turki's US and British education at Princeton, Cambridge and Georgetown has given him an invaluable perspective on Western culture and thinking, as well as providing him with lifelong contacts amongst decision-makers in Washington and Whitehall.
He went on to become Saudi Arabia's spy chief, running the foreign intelligence department for 24 years, with special responsibility for Afghanistan.
Following the 9/11 attacks in 2001 he became Saudi Arabia's ambassador in London and then Washington.
In London, his media spokesman at the embassy was the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was eventually murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by Saudi government agents in 2018. Saudi Arabia blamed this on an unauthorised ""rogue operation"".
Now aged 78, with no formal position in the Saudi government, Prince Turki al-Faisal nevertheless provides an intriguing insight into Saudi thinking on the few occasions when he speaks publicly at international forums.
Saudi Arabia's rulers don't like Hamas. In fact, many of the governments in the region don't like it either. The rulers of Egypt, Jordan, UAE and Bahrain see Hamas and its revolutionary brand of so-called ""political Islam"" as a threat to their secular rule.
The Palestinian Authority, based on Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, was effectively chased out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007. Some of its members were thrown off the roofs of high buildings during a short-lived internecine conflict.
Although Hamas maintains a political office in Qatar its main backer is Iran, which has long been a historic rival to Saudi Arabia.
Although the Saudis and Iranians formally agreed to end their dispute in March this year, there remains considerable mutual mistrust between them. Despite this, they have jointly condemned Israel's bombing of Gaza and reaffirmed their support for a Palestinian state.
It is hard to believe now but only two weeks ago, prior to the Hamas raid, Saudi Arabia was well on the way to normalising ties with Israel, just as the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco have done. This is now on hold.
Several analysts believe that Hamas's deadly raid into Israel was partly prompted by a desire to derail that normalisation that would have left Hamas and Iran sidelined in a new Middle East.
Will things ever return to the status quo in the region?
Right now, it is hard to see that happening, with a wounded Israel in no mood for compromise and nervous Arab governments eyeing the growing anti-Israel protests on the streets.
But when the current conflict in Gaza ends, as it must do, then it may well be Saudi Arabia's deep pockets that help fund its reconstruction. It will be worth watching Prince Turki's speeches for the Saudi view of whatever comes next.

Kibbutz Kfar Aza: Hamas killed whole families,,BBC,,"The BBC's International Editor Jeremy Bowen has visited the village Kfar Aza - the site of a massacre committed by Hamas near the border with Gaza.
Israeli soldiers said that Hamas stormed in, burning homes and killing families. An Israeli officer told the BBC that some of the dead had been beheaded.
Israel continues its heavy bombing of Gaza, and has cut off supplies of food, water and power to the enclave.

Gaza war: Premature babies evacuated from al-Shifa hospital,,BBC,,"Thirty-one premature Palestinian babies have been evacuated from Gaza City's al-Shifa hospital, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as a ""death zone"".
The babies have been taken to an Emirati hospital in the southern city of Rafah, close to the Egyptian border.
Hundreds of people, including patients, left from al-Shifa on Saturday.
The hospital - the territory's largest and most modern - is under the control of Israeli troops.
They have been searching the complex for evidence that it served as headquarters of Hamas.
On Saturday, hundreds of people, including some patients, evacuated the hospital, but some 300 critically ill people remained as well as 33 premature babies. A Red Crescent spokeswoman told the BBC that one baby then died on Friday evening and another on Saturday morning.
On Sunday the 31 surviving babies were evacuated by the Red Crescent in coordination with the UN.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the babies were ""very sick"", had been moved under ""extremely intense and high-risk security conditions"", and were now ""receiving urgent care in the neonatal intensive care unit"" in Rafah.
Dr Mohammad Zaqout, general director of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, told AP some of the babies were dehydrated or had developed gastritis due to unsanitised water. Lack of medications had caused others to develop sepsis, and some had hypothermia as they could not be placed in incubators.
The babies had been accompanied by six health workers and 10 staff family members, Dr Tedros said.
Doctors at al-Shifa had previously said newborns had died after power for incubators was cut off due to a lack of fuel.
Red Crescent spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told the BBC that some of the premature babies' parents had been killed in Israeli air strikes. The BBC is not able to independently verify this.
She said the surviving parents had been ordered to leave Gaza City - where al-Shifa hospital is located - before the babies' evacuation, and their current whereabouts were unknown.
A Gaza health ministry Facebook page urged the babies' parents to rejoin their babies at the hospital in Rafah.
Israel has not yet commented, though it previously said it would help evacuate babies to a ""safer hospital"".
The WHO was planning further missions to take the remaining patients and staff out of al-Shifa once safe passage guarantees had been secured, he said.
Al-Shifa's hospital director Dr Muhammad Abu Salima has called on the WHO and the UN to help the medical teams and patients ""leave this desolated place"".
He told BBC Arabic there were about 25 medical staff left at the hospital, but that without water and electricity they were unable to properly care for the hundreds of remaining patients.
""The hospital, now, is a ghost house in the full sense of the word,"" he said.
""Corpses are spreading out in the emergency department, patients are screaming, the medical staff is quite helpless, while the army is walking freely around in the hospital,"" he said.
Israel has said Hamas has a command centre under al-Shifa - a claim Hamas has denied - but has not yet provided substantial evidence of this.
Later on Sunday the Israeli military released footage which it said showed a ""55m-long terror tunnel, 10m deep underneath the Shifa hospital"". The footage shows a tunnel leading to a door. The IDF said investigations were ""continuing to uncover the route of the tunnel"".
Earlier this week, Israel military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, said it couldtake weeksto fully search the medical complex.
Hamas, classified as a terrorist organisation in many Western countries, attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostage.
Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas.
The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.

Scottish Labour leader Sarwar says Israel 'breaking international law' in Gaza,2023-10-24,BBC,,"The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has accused Israel of a ""clear breach"" of international law in Gaza.
He told the BBC there was ""no justification for the withholding of essential supplies"" from the people of Gaza.
His comments came amid resignations within the party over Sir Keir Starmer's stance on the crisis.
The Labour leader has repeatedly insisted Israel has a right to defend itself within international law.
More than 1,400 Israelis have been killed since Hamas launched its attack on 7 October, according to Israeli authorities - the vast majority in the initial assault. More than 220 are believed to have been taken hostage inside Gaza.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's air strikes began in response, and according to the Palestinian health ministry in the occupied West Bank, 91 Palestinians have been killed there since 7 October.
Speaking after an Institute for Government event in London, Mr Sarwar said: ""There is no justification for the withholding of essential supplies; water, electricity, medicine and food from the people of Gaza. It is a clear breach of international law.""
""There is no grey area. International law is clear. Withholding of water, energy and essential supplies is a breach of international law and therefore there must be a immediate humanitarian corridor opened so that is accessed by the people in Gaza.""
He said he made his remarks ""whilst unequivocally condemning Hamas"" and called for ""a de-escalation of violence"" and the end of  ""rocket fire coming into and out of Gaza"".
""We must condemn Hamas but we cannot pretend that Hamas is the Palestinian people,"" he added.
Mr Sarwar's comments come amid a number of resignations of Labour party members and elected officials across the UK, including15 officials in Scotland.
Nine officers in a Glasgow ward, including a Labour peer, and six in Edinburgh stood down earlier this week.
The Glasgow Kelvin officers accused Scottish Labour of ""stifling democracy"" after a motion calling for an end to military action was ruled out of order.
Asked about Labour officers resigning their positions in Glasgow and Edinburgh constituency Labour parties (CLPs), Mr Sarwar said he disputed claims the party was stifling debate.
""I don't want to trivialise the issue by talking about individual CLPs… it's being talked about nationally and right across the country,"" he said.
Two councillorswho resigned from the party in Oxfordhave objected to comments made by Sir Keir on a radio programme earlier this month.
Pressed at the time on whether cutting off water and power supplies into Gaza would be appropriate as part of an Israeli response, he said: ""I think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation.
""Obviously, everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself,"" he added.
Sir Keir later clarified those comments by explaining he was speaking about Israel's right to defend itself, not to cut off power and water, and that Israel should respond within international law.
Meanwhile, the first minister has said hismother-in-law,who is stuck in Gaza, has ""lost hope"".
Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged travelled to the region before the Hamas attack and subsequent Israeli reprisals left them trapped.
In a statement in the Scottish Parliament, Humza Yousaf reiterated calls for a ceasefire, an increase in aid and a global refugee settlement scheme to be created for those who wish to flee.
Speaking about his in-laws, Mr Yousaf said he and his wife Nadia could barely sleep for worry.
""Throughout the day, the 100 people in the family home must ration their food. The adults barely eat, my mother-in-law only ate cashew nuts yesterday, they ration so the children in the house don't end up malnourished, but time is running out,"" he said.
""I spoke to my mother-in-law this morning. She feels helpless and has lost hope. She told me she feels as if the UK Government has forgotten about her.
""Please don't interpret my point as a political one, it is not,"" he added.
Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said his party ""stands with Israel"", but also with civilians in Gaza, saying: ""The Palestinian people are not Hamas.
""They are civilians, they are innocent, they are simply caught in a terrible situation. And they are also suffering from the tyranny, exploitation and oppression of Hamas terrorists.""
Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton praised the ""quiet dignity"" with which the First Minister has carried himself since the Hamas attack, saying that both those in Gaza and Israel ""have the right to live free from fear""

British-Palestinians ask PM for urgent meeting over Gaza,,BBC,By Ashitha Nagesh,"A British-Palestinian group has written to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, asking for an ""urgent meeting"" about Gaza.
The letter also urges the UK government to ""use its influence"" to call for a ceasefire.
It was sent, earlier on Monday, by the UK-based International Centre of Justice for Palestinians.
The ICJP said it was speaking ""on behalf of members of the Palestinian community in the UK with families and loved ones living in Gaza"".
The group said it wanted a meeting ""to express our concerns, similar to the meetings you have had with other British communities who have families in the region who have experienced distress similar to ours"".
Calls for humanitarian pauses were ""inadequate"", it said. And the government's failure to call for a ceasefire ""is putting our loved ones in danger and is contributing to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis"".
""It also ignores our voices as British citizens with friends and family under attack in Gaza,"" the ICJP said.
A spokesperson for the UK government told the BBC that it had ""helped more than 150 British nationals and dependents to leave Gaza so far"".
""We must see humanitarian pauses that allow enough time for hostages to be released, as well as aid to go in,"" it said.
It said the Foreign Office was in regular contact with those who remained in Gaza, ""and our teams are working around the clock with the Israeli and Egyptian authorities to ensure they can leave as quickly as possible"".
Six British-Palestinians told a press conference dozens of their family members had been killed in Gaza.
Lubaba Khalid, who stepped down from chairing the Young BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) Labour network last month, over comments made by Labour leader Keir Starmer, said she had found out on social media her relatives had been killed.
""Due to the lack of electricity and networks, we have found it very difficult keep in touch with family members just to check if they're alive,"" she said.
""As a result, I found out my great uncle's house was bombed, on the social-media platform X [formerly known as Twitter] before I could get any confirmation from my own family.""
Six members of her family had been killed in that bombing, she said, five of them children.
Accountant Omar Mofeed accused the UK government of ""double standards"" in its treatment of those evacuating Gaza.
Non-British family members of British nationals who have fled Gaza and are now in Cairo currently need to apply for British family visas from Egypt.
And Mr Mofeed pointed to the visa schemes available to those fleeing war in Ukraine, including the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme - also known as Homes for Ukraine - and the Ukraine Family Scheme, both of which are free for those applying.
The Foreign Office has previously told BBC News it is working with the Home Office to process visas for non-British family members of British nationals who have left Gaza.

Tel Aviv: Seven injured in Palestinian car-ramming and stabbing attack,2023-07-04,BBC,By David Gritten,"A Palestinian man has injured at least seven people in a car-ramming and stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, Israeli police say.
A police spokesperson said the ""terrorist"" rammed into pedestrians and then tried to stab them with a sharp object. He was shot dead by a civilian.
Three of the injured were in a serious condition, the spokesperson added.
The attacker has been identified as a Palestinian from the occupied West Bank who was a known Hamas activist.
The Palestinian militant group praised the attack, saying it was a ""natural response"" to the ongoing major Israeli military operation in Jenin refugee camp, in the northern West Bank.
At least 10 Palestinians are said to have been killed since hundreds of Israeli troops, backed by drone strikes, entered the camp on Monday morning, triggering intense gun battles with militants inside.
The Israeli military said that while it was ""operating to maintain stability in the Jenin camp by targeting the terrorist infrastructure, our civilians are consequently being targeted by terrorism"".
CCTV footage from the scene of the attack in Tel Aviv shows pedestrians and customers of a cafe running for cover as a pick-up truck hits a bus stop on Pinchas Rosen Street.
The driver is seen climbing out of the vehicle's window and running runs towards a man standing near the cafe, who he appears to stab several times. He then chases after other people on the pavement.
A second video appears to shows another man wearing a motorcycle helmet shooting the attacker several times with a pistol as he lies on the ground.
The Israeli police spokesperson said three of the victims were in a serious condition, two were in a moderate condition and two were in a mild condition.
The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it had treated a 47-year-old woman who was in a serious condition, with multiple systemic injuries.
""I would like to praise the activity of the citizen with a lot of courage, that he was able to thwart the attack and prevent the continuation of that terrorist's killing spree,"" Israel Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai told reporters at the scene,according to the Jerusalem Post newspaper.
He also said investigations were still being carried out into the attacker.
The Shin Bet security service said he was a Palestinian from the southern West Bank village of Samu who did not have ""a previous security background"" and who did not have a permit to enter Israel.
Since the start of the year, more than 140 Palestinians - both militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, while another 36 have been killed in the Gaza Strip.
Twenty-four Israelis, two foreigners and a Palestinian worker have been killed in attacks or apparent attacks by Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank over the same period. All were civilians except one off-duty serving soldier and a member of the Israeli security forces.

Reporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry',,BBC,By Fergal Keane,"The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone.
He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol.
And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night.
That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.
In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.
Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions.
Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.
When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work.
""As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,"" he says, ""sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent.""
Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid?
We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings.
This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.
The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene.
""I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,"" he tells me, ""but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need.""
Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances.
This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll.
""This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,"" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ.
""We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit.""
In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately.
Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war.
""I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,"" she says.
""He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him.
""He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza.""
Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike.
A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

Six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in West Bank and Gaza,2023-09-20,BBC,By Yolande Knell & Lucy Williamson,"Six Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, medics say.
Four men were killed during a military raid in Jenin refugee camp late on Tuesday night. Three of them were claimed by militant groups as members.
Another young Palestinian man was killed during an Israeli raid in Jericho on Wednesday morning.
The sixth was killed during violent demonstrations on Tuesday evening near the Gaza-Israel separation fence.
There was intense fighting on Tuesday night in the Jenin camp, a stronghold of Palestinian militants, where the Israeli military launchedits biggest operation in years in the West Bank back in July.
In the morning, residents of the camp cleared up the damage to a house which had been surrounded by Israeli forces.
It was left pockmarked with bullet holes, and the floor was covered in broken glass and blood stains.
At one of the camp's entrances, Umm Omar showed the dried blood around her fingernails from one young militant she had dragged into her home during the night.
Raafat Khamaysi, 22, was injured in the exchange of fire with Israeli forces close to her house. She said he bled for two hours before he died.
The nearest hospital is less than 100m (328ft) away, but the fighting prevented an ambulance getting through in time.
Umm Omar was impassive as she told her story - such confrontations have become almost routine during her 40 years living in the camp.
Later, funeral processions filled the local streets, the green flags of the militant group Hamas mingling with the black flags of Islamic Jihad above the crowds of masked men.
Outside the house where 24-year-old Mahmoud al-Saadi's body was brought before burial, the sound of gunfire to honour his death met the wails of his family - militants and his mother each claiming him in their own way.
Saadi's name and face will now join the army of those pasted on walls around the camp that commemorate the casualties - many of them aligned with militant groups - of previous deadly confrontations there.
The Israeli military said that its forces came under fire from local gunmen during Tuesday's raid and that it carried out a rare strike using a suicide drone.
While leaving the camp, the military said, an explosive device detonated underneath one of its vehicles, so that those inside had to be rescued. No soldiers were injured.
A video posted on social media appeared to show Israeli gunfire hitting the minaret of a mosque from which shots were being fired.
All four Palestinians killed were men in their 20s, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Shortly after the Israeli troops withdrew from the refugee camp, the Palestinian Authority (PA) said that gunmen shot at its compound in Jenin. Militants from the camp accused the PA, which governs parts of the West Bank not under full Israeli control, of failing to protect them.
The bloodshed in Jenin was the latest in an upsurge in violence in the West Bank, where the Israeli military says it has been carrying out counter-terrorism activities over the past year and a half.
Wednesday morning saw a deadly Israeli military raid in Aqabat Jaber refugee camp in Jericho.
The local hospital said that a 19-year-old man who died was shot in the head. He has since been buried.
Witnesses said that locals had thrown stones at Israeli soldiers who entered the camp.
The Israeli military said explosive devices were also thrown as its forces carried out an arrest raid.
Tensions now seem to be spreading to Gaza, where a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli forces for the first time during several days of violent protests by the separation fence.
The Israeli military said hundreds of rioters gathered next to the fence and detonated explosive devices, and that its forces responded with ""riot disposal means and sniper fire"".
It added that it was aware that a Palestinian had died and that the incident was under review.
Israel has kept the Erez crossing with Gaza almost completely closed since the Jewish Rosh Hashanah holiday, in response to the recent renewed demonstrations near the fence. Thousands of Palestinian workers were blocked from entering Israel.
The protests in Gaza had been more intense on Tuesday evening, with some participants managing to cut through the fence in one place.
There is speculation that Hamas, which governs Gaza, has allowed the protests to restart as it tries to gain leverage in indirect talks with Israel brokered by Qatar.
Tensions have risen as a result of delays on Qatari aid which Israel allows into Gaza.
A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations said that these were continuing, but progress had not been made.
Israel blames Hamas for instigating increased attacks against its soldiers and civilians in the West Bank.

Palestinian killed as Israeli settlers attack town after deadly shooting,,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"A Palestinian man has been shot dead and several wounded after Israeli settlers went on a violent rampage in the occupied West Bank.
Residents told the BBC they feared for their lives as hundreds of armed settlers torched homes and cars in the town of Turmusaya.
One accused the Israeli army of leaving them helpless for 45 minutes during the attack.
""They gave the settlers the chance to do this,"" he said.
It was an apparent reprisal attack, hours after the funeral in a nearby settlement of a 17-year-old who was among four Israeli settlers shot dead by Palestinian gunmen at a petrol station on Tuesday.
The Israeli military condemned the settler attacks, but did not respond to questions about the speed or nature of its response.
Fears are mounting of an even more deadly bout of violence in the West Bank, coming after an Israeli military raid in the city of Jenin on Monday which killed seven Palestinians.
It saw some of the most intense fighting in the territory for years, involving Israeli forces using an Apache attack helicopter to fire missiles at militants who had targeted troop carriers with explosives, leaving seven Israeli soldiers wounded.
Among the Palestinians killed were two 15-year-olds and two Islamic Jihad militants.
That was claimed to be the trigger for the following day's deadly attack at a petrol station by gunmen from the militant group Hamas.
In turn, hard-line pro-settler ministers in Israel's religious-nationalist coalition have called for a full-scale military operation in the West Bank, including air strikes to destroy Palestinian buildings, while one MP called for ""collective punishment"" against ordinary Palestinians.
In Turmusaya, footage showed cars ablaze with thick clouds of black smoke swirling above the town, while the sound of tear gas or stun grenade blasts could be heard in the background.
The mayor, Lafi Adeeb, told the BBC about 400 settlers rampaged through the town, torching homes and cars, while he said five residents were hit with live ammunition.
Confrontations reportedly broke out between Israeli forces and some residents who had attempted to defend the town during the attacks.
The Palestinian health ministry said 27-year-old Omar Qateen was shot dead by Israeli forces ""while confronting the settlers"".
Israel's paramilitary border police said its forces were securing firefighters when residents ""rioted"" and troops fired at a man who shot at them. The BBC has not been able to verify the circumstances of his death.
Turmusaya is well known for its American ties and many Palestinians who live there are dual US citizens.
Resident Sam Abdullah told the BBC his daughter-in-law was visiting from the US and was inside the family home when settlers aimed a gun at her, trying to set the house on fire.
""They pointed inside each house and tried to lock people inside and burned the houses. They didn't give people any chance to leave. We were lucky to save my daughter,"" he said.
Her belongings including her US passport were destroyed when her rental car was torched, says Mr Abdullah.
""It took 45 minutes for the [Israeli] army to come. The army didn't help us when they started burning [the houses], they could have come in five or 10 minutes… They gave the settlers the chance to do this,"" said Mr Abdullah.
Another resident said she was visiting the doctor in nearby Ramallah when her children phoned and started screaming.
""My children were hiding in the basement… they told me settlers are attacking us, smashing the windows.  The settlers threw Molotov cocktails to burn the house while they were inside. They sneaked out from the balcony while half the settlers were roaming around the house,"" she said.
""Thank God the youth rushed to help… Thank God my children are safe,"" she added.
In a statement the Israeli military condemned the violence and said: ""Security forces entered the town in order to extinguish the fires, prevent clashes and to collect evidence. The Israeli civilians exited the town and the Israel Police has opened an investigation into the event.""
The attacks in Turmusaya followed a night of settler violence elsewhere in the West Bank.
Residents in the village of Al-Lubban Al-Sharqeya said Israeli soldiers and police stood by as a large group of settlers burned a petrol station, orchards, a cement factory and dozens of cars.
Settlements are seen as illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.
Attacks by settlers in the West Bank have drawn mounting international concern, particularly followinga deadly rampage through the Palestinian town of Hawaraearlier this year.
In an apparent reference to Wednesday's violence, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""We will not accept any challenge against the police and the security forces in these places and anywhere. We are a country of law.""

"When they called their mother, Hamas answered the phone",,BBC,By Nadia Ragozhina,"Nearly four weeks have passed since Hamas kidnapped about 240 people into Gaza - among them is 84-year-old Ditza Heiman.
When Ditza's daughter called her on 7 October, Hamas answered the phone.
""They were shouting 'It's Hamas, it's Hamas',"" another daughter, Neta Heiman Mina, told the BBC.
""My sister was terrified, she hung up. I didn't think they had taken her. I thought they had killed her.""
Ditza Heiman is being held hostage in Gaza.
She was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas staged its deadly attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage.
Neta says she was in touch with her mother in the morning. Ditza was in her safe room and didn't know what was happening outside.
""I don't think she realised, or we realised, that the terrorists were at the kibbutz,"" Neta said.
The last message she got from her mother was a few minutes before 10:00 local time. After that she didn't answer her phone.
Neta later spoke to one of her mother's neighbours, who told her that Ditza had been calling for help. He went out to see what was happening and saw her being taken away by Hamas gunmen.
""There were too many terrorists outside, they started shooting. He crawled back into his shelter. He was lucky,"" Neta said.
On a Hamas Facebook page, Neta and her sister found a video that showed her mother. ""They took her. They put her in a car. When we found the video, we knew she was alive.""
Ditza Heiman had lived all her adult life in Nir Oz. A social worker who had only stopped working a few years ago, she has 12 grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and ""so many more children who grew up with her and consider her to be family"".
Neta's voice is unwavering as she talks about her mother. She lived on her own, she cooked for herself, she walked places.
""But she walked slowly. I don't think she could walk for many kilometres, like Yocheved,"" Neta said, referring to 85-year-old Yocheved Lifschitz who was freed last month and who has spoken of having to walk in the tunnels.
Ms Lifschitz described being taken into a ""spider's web"" of tunnels underneath Gaza.
Neta is very worried about the ground offensive in Gaza. She doesn't know what it means for the hostages, and she is also concerned for the young soldiers.
""They are all friends of my children, they are children of my friends. I don't think it will bring the hostages back,"" she said.
She wants Israel's government to ""talk directly to Hamas"".
A long-time activist with Women Wage Peace, the largest Israeli grassroots peace movement made up of Jewish and Arab women, she has long campaigned for an agreement-based resolution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
She also blames Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for what has happened.
""In the last nine months they did everything to escalate the situation, especially in the West Bank,"" she said.
She says that Hamas attacked at a time when many Israeli troops had been stationed in the occupied West Bank.
""The army was there [in the West Bank], to protect the Sukkah [a shelter put up as part of a Jewish festival]."" she says, referring to tensions in the flashpoint town of Huwara.
""They were there and they didn't protect my mother. And now they need to do everything to bring them [the hostages] back.""

Israel-Gaza war: 'I couldn't believe it was possible to kidnap an 85-year-old woman',2023-11-06,BBC,By Nadia Ragozhina,"It has been nearly a month since Adva Adar's 85-year-old grandmother was kidnapped by Hamas and hustled across the border into Gaza on a golf cart.
She was one of more than 200 people taken from Israel on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip.
As the Israeli military continues to pound the territory with air strikes and encircles Gaza City, Adva says she is holding on to hope that the Israeli military is focused on rescuing the hostages.
""If they are doing a ground invasion in Gaza, then they are doing it because this can help bring the hostages back,"" she says over the phone from Israel.
""If I don't believe it, I can't have hope. And if I can't have hope, I have no reason to wake up in the morning. I need to believe she will be back.""
Adva had planned to visit her grandmother, Yafa, at the Kibbutz Nir Oz with her family on 7 October to mark the Jewish festival of Sukkot.
But at 06:30 that morning, her grandmother wrote in the family chat that she was hiding from rocket fire in her shelter.
""Other members of my family [at the kibbutz] told me that the terrorists were going from house to house. They were burning the houses, shooting and kidnapping people,"" Adva says.
After a few hours, she lost contact with her grandmother. But that evening, she was stunned to see a video that Hamas had posted online of Yafa.
""She was on a golf cart with four terrorists around her. I was terrified. I couldn't believe it was even possible to kidnap an 85-year-old woman from her bed. It is unhuman behaviour, beyond possible.""
Adva says that her grandmother's health is a huge concern.
""She is ill, she has heart failure, kidney problems, blood pressure. She needs a lot of medication for her system to function, to release the pain she's in. She almost can't walk or sit straight.""
""Every hour that's passing is an hour I don't know if she made it.""
Yafa Adar was one of the founding members of Kibbutz Nir Oz and had lived there for 60 years. She worked as a dental assistant, in the library and looked after the children.
A mother of three, a grandmother of eight and a great-grandmother seven times over, Yafa is not the only member of the Adar family who was caught up in the deadly Hamas attacks.
Her grandson Tamir - Adva's cousin - is missing. He left his wife and two children in the shelter of their family home in Nir Oz and went to protect his community as soon as he heard that Hamas gunmen were in the kibbutz.
At 08:00 he called his wife. ""He didn't think that they were going to make it,"" Adva tells me. ""He told her not to open the door to anyone and he said his goodbye.""
Tamir has not been heard from since. The family don't know if he was taken to Gaza, murdered or injured.
Adva also has a grandfather, an aunt and another cousin, who survived the attacks.
Her grandfather, Yoram, ""aged 50 years in a day. When the terrorists couldn't kidnap him, they burnt his house. He inhaled a lot of smoke, he was in a critical condition in the hospital for a few days, but now he is doing better,"" Adva says.
""He is scared of everything. Scared is not an emotion I would have ever used to describe him in the past... He might survive this,"" she says, ""but mentally I don't know for how long.""
Adva's aunt Vered had to run for her life after gunmen got into her house, filled it with cooking gas and set it on fire.
""She's OK physically, but they are traumatised in a very severe way,"" Adva says.
""How will they ever feel safe if you can't feel safe in your house? If you don't know you can go to bed and feel safe in your bed. I don't know how you recover from something like this.""
Adva says that her family have nothing to go back to. Her aunt left in her pyjamas and her glasses.
""Everything was destroyed and what wasn't destroyed was stolen... And it's so sad, because it was heaven in that kibbutz. It became hell in minutes.""

Israeli woman shot dead in attack on car in southern West Bank,2023-08-21,BBC,By David Gritten,"An Israeli woman has been killed and a man seriously wounded in a suspected Palestinian shooting attack on a car near Hebron in the occupied West Bank.
Two dozen bullets were reportedly fired from a passing vehicle on a highway close to the settlement of Beit Hagai.
The woman has been named as Batsheva Nigri. A girl who was also in the car, said to be her daughter, was unharmed.
The Israeli military said its soldiers were pursuing the suspects and that roadblocks had been set up in the area.
Palestinian media reported they had encircled Hebron and were questioning Palestinians trying to enter or leave the city.
Ms Nigri was a mother of three and nursery teacher who lived in Beit Hagai, according to Israeli media.
She and her 12-year-old daughter had hitched a ride to their home from the man driving the car, reports said.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas praised the attack, calling it a ""natural response"" to Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank.
Later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the scene and said Israel was ""in the midst of a terror attack"" that was ""encouraged, guided, funded by Iran and its satellite states"".
Meanwhile, the Palestinian health ministry said six Palestinians were shot and wounded by Israeli forces in the village of Beita, in the northern West Bank. One person who was hit in the head was in a critical condition in hospital, it added.
A video circulated online appeared to show a man being shot in the back of the head while he runs away from Israeli troops.
It comes amid another spike in violence in the West Bank.
On Saturday, an Israeli man and his son were shot dead by a suspected Palestinian gunman at a car wash near the northern village of Hawara.
On Friday, Israeli forces shot a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in the head in occupied East Jerusalem, leaving him seriously wounded. Police alleged he had tried to throw a petrol bomb during a raid in the Silwan area.
Elsewhere that day, video showed an apparently unarmed Palestinian man said to suffer from mental health problems being shot in the leg by Israeli troops during a protest near Israel's separation barrier in Qalqilya.
There have been dozens of Israeli army raids into Palestinian cities this year as well as violence by Israeli settlers targeting Palestinian homes and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.
Update 22 August 2023: This story has been updated to say that Batsheva Nigri's daughter was 12 years old and not six, as initial reports stated.

Outrage over Abbas's antisemitic speech on Jews and Holocaust,,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"German and Israeli officials have condemned Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for comments he made about Jews and the Nazi Holocaust in a speech.
Mr Abbas said Adolf Hitler ordered the mass murder of Jews because of their ""social role"" as moneylenders, rather than out of animosity to Judaism.
Israel's ambassador to the UN accused him of ""pure antisemitism"".
""History is clear,""Germany's Ramallah mission said. ""Millions of lives were erased - this cannot be relativized.""
""We strive to promote a dignified and accurate memory of the victims.""
The German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, added: ""The Palestinians deserve to hear the historical truth from their leader, not such distortions.""
Hitler used the Jewish people as a scapegoat for Germany's ills. He also considered them an inferior race which had to be exterminated.
The Palestinian president, who is 87, has previously been denounced by Jewish groups as a Holocaust denier for his doctoral thesis on the Nazis and Zionism.
Yet over the years, he has continued to give long, rambling speeches expounding his offensive views.
His address to the Fatah Revolutionary Council was made last month and later aired on Palestine TV.His remarks were then translated and publicised by the Middle East Media Research Institute on Wednesday. The translation has been verified by BBC News.
""They say that Hitler killed the Jews for being Jews, and that Europe hated the Jews because they were Jews. No. It was clearly explained that they fought them because of their social role and not their religion,"" Mr Abbas says at one point.
Later, he specifies that he was referring to the role of Jews involving ""usury, money and so on"".
Mr Abbas also resurrected a long abandoned historical theory that European Ashkenazi Jews were not descended from the ancient Israelites but from 8th Century converts to Judaism among the Khazars, a nomadic Turkic people.
""The truth that we should spread to the world is that European Jews are not Semites. They have nothing to do with Semitism,"" he said. ""As for the Eastern Jews, they are Semites,"" he added, referring to Mizrachi Jews from the wider Middle East.
The president previously caused an international furore for making similar suggestions in 2018, during what he described as ""a history lesson"" at a rare gathering of the Palestinian National Council.
His aim on such occasions is to dispute the connection between the Jewish people and modern-day Israel. Rights to the land lie at the core of the Israel-Palestinian conflict and are entwined with the historical narratives of both peoples.
The content of the president's latest speech was shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, by the Israeli foreign ministry andslammed by the Israeli ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan.
""This is the true face of Palestinian 'leadership',"" the envoy said. ""Just as Abbas blames the Jews for the Holocaust, he also blames the Jews for all the Middle East's issues.""
""The world must wake up and hold Abbas and his Palestinian Authority accountable for the hatred they spew and the ensuing bloodshed it causes. There must be zero tolerance for Palestinian incitement and terror!""
The European Union also condemned the speech, which it described as ""false and grossly misleading"".
In a statement, it said: ""Such historical distortions are inflammatory, deeply offensive, can only serve to exacerbate tensions in the region and serve no-one's interests. They play into the hands of those who do not want a two-state solution, which President Abbas has repeatedly advocated for.""
""Moreover, they trivialize [the] Holocaust and thereby fuel antisemitism and are an insult to the millions of victims of the Holocaust and their families.""
In May, Mr Abbas was criticised for likening Israel to Nazi Germany in a speech at a UN event. He accused the country of lying ""just like Goebbels"", referring to Joseph Goebbels, the chief propagandist of the Nazi party.
Last year, there was international outrage after he claimed Israel had carried out ""50 massacres; 50 holocausts"" during a news conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin. The chancellor later said he was ""disgusted by the outrageous remarks"" and Israel and the US issued strongly worded statements.
Afterwards, the Palestinian leader issued a clarification on the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa. He did not explicitly apologise but said that the Holocaust was ""the most heinous crime in modern human history"" and that his comments had not been meant ""to deny the singularity of the Holocaust"".

'I simply don’t want to die at 24' - Gaza woman trapped at Rafah crossing,2023-11-01,BBC,By Fergal Keane,"This was their third time trying to cross. But there were reasons to hope. All the news reports said the border would definitely open.
The family had been called by the Jordanian embassy and told to go to the Rafah crossing.
Tala Abu Nahleh's mother is a Jordanian citizen. Foreign passport holders were going to be allowed through. So were the wounded and the seriously sick.
Tala's 15-year-old brother Yazid is disabled and suffers from seizures. He can only move from one place to another with the aid of a wheelchair. The hospitals in Gaza have run out of the medication he needs, while the bombing has exacerbated his condition.
""Once the escalation started,"" Tala says, ""he got very afraid, the seizures kept getting worse and worse. Every time I believe it's gotten to the worst, it just keeps getting worse.""
There are six in the family and Tala is the sole financial support. She won scholarships and studied in the US and Beirut, Lebanon. Confident and articulate as she is, it is easy to imagine her guiding her family through the challenges of life beyond Gaza's borders.
""We are trying to survive. We're not sure we're going to make it, but we're trying to do everything we can to survive, because I simply don't want to die at 24.""
The border is a place where the word ""luck"" has different meanings. It means escaping bombing, hunger and lack of water.
It also means having to leave behind those you love who don't have foreign passports, or who are not badly wounded enough to merit evacuation, or who are trapped under fire and cannot reach the border.
The number of those who have left, or will be able to leave, is only a tiny percentage of Gaza's population of 2.2 million people.
Mona - she did not wish to give her surname - is an Australian citizen through marriage. She came to the border alone and was haunted by the thought of her family trapped in Gaza.
""I'm not happy at all, because I'm leaving my other part, my brothers and sisters, my whole family is still here. I wish, God willing, they would all be in a safe place. The situation is terrible there, it's very very bad,"" she says.
Groups of men gathered in front of paper lists posted on windows on the Gaza side of the crossing. Fingers ran down lines of names seeking out those already approved for departure. Families sat on the plastic chairs of the waiting hall, a small space into which so much hope is being funnelled.
Altogether, 400 foreign nationals and wounded people were able to leave Gaza on the first day of the evacuation on Wednesday.
By the day's end, it was clear to Tala Abu Nahleh that her family would not be so fortunate. They went home to their apartment, dark like those of their neighbours because there is no electricity.
Tala sent us a video message saying she did not know how to feel any more. She sounded and looked weary.
""We came back to no electricity, no food for today, no clean water to drink or even washing water. And one more day closer to my brother running out of medications, and we're still here. And it's night. I don't know if we will make it tomorrow, but I hope so.""

Moment Israeli tank appears to fire on car inside Gaza,2023-10-30,BBC,,"Video uploaded on social media shows the moment an Israeli tank appears to fire on a car on a key north-south Gaza road.
The car is seen driving on Salah-al-Din Road, south of Gaza City. It is one of two routes that Palestinians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip had been told by Israel to use to evacuate south for their safety.
As the car approaches the tank, it makes a U-turn, before the tank fires.
The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza says the road is now open and no longer blocked.

Israel orders evacuations from city in south Gaza as offensive widens,,BBC,By Paul Adams & David Gritten,"Israel's military has ordered the evacuation of a fifth of the main city in southern Gaza, as it expands its ground offensive against Hamas.
A map showed six northern and central areas of Khan Younis where an estimated 167,000 people needed to leave.
Witnesses also reported seeing tanks to the east, and a doctor said a local hospital was overwhelmed by casualties.
In Gaza City, an unconfirmed report says 50 people were killed when Israeli air strikes hit two schools.
According to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, they died in schools sheltering displaced people in the city's Daraj neighbourhood.
Reuters news agency has said that the strikes are still to be independently verified and that the Hamas-run health ministry could not be reached for comment. The Israeli army said it was looking into the report.
Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are sheltering in the south after being previously ordered to leave the north.
The Israeli military said it would operate with ""maximum force"" in the south, as it had done in the north - where there has been widespread destruction over the past eight weeks.
Israel launched a full-scale campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says almost 15,900 people have been killed in the territory since the war began, while the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding.
A temporary ceasefire that lasted for seven days, which led to the release of 105 of the hostages and 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails, fell apart on Friday.
BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, says about 200 Israeli air strikes were reported overnight.
About 15 to 20 locations were targeted in and around Khan Younis, where the local population has swelled to as much as 1.2 million, according to local authorities. The central town of Deir al-Balah, about 8km (5 miles) to the north, was also bombed heavily.
Dozens of casualties, including women and children, arrived at Khan Younis's Nasser Hospital from different areas. Many were dead or seriously injured.
Mohammed Eid wiped tears from his bandaged face as he lined up among the mourners by bodies covered in white shrouds outside the hospital on Monday morning.
""We were sleeping safely, minding our own business. Suddenly, a bomb fell on us, and the whole building was destroyed,"" he told the BBC.
""My brother was torn into pieces, and so was his wife. My daughter was killed, and his daughters were killed, including his littlest. We can't find my mum, and my niece.""
Later, witnesses and local journalists in Gaza reported that they had seen Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles on the eastern outskirts of Khan Younis, by Abasan and Khuzaa, which is nearest to the boundary fence with Israel.
Moaz Mohammed told AFP news agency that he had seen tanks moving down the main north-south highway, Salah al-Din Road, which has been one of two Israeli-designated evacuation routes.
The tanks were ""firing bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area"" between Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, he said.
At the same time, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned civilians to avoid a section of Salah al-Din Road in the same area, saying it now constituted a ""battlefield"" and was ""extremely dangerous"".
The IDF also posted a mapthat ordered residents of six northern and central neighbourhoods of Khan Younis - al-Mahatta, al-Katiba, Hamad, al-Satir, Bani Suheila and Ma'in - to leave immediately to ""preserve your safety and security"".
According to the UN, the marked area in Khan Younis was home to almost 117,000 people before the war. It also includes 21 shelters where 50,000 displaced people are currently living.
The map tells them to move to al-Fukhari, east of Khan Younis, and Rafah's al-Shaboura and Tal al-Sultan neighbourhoods, which are already overcrowded.
IDF chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that Israeli forces were continuing to operate with ""maximum force against Hamas terrorists and infrastructure, while minimising harm to the civilians that Hamas places around them as shields"".
""We are dropping leaflets with QR codes that opens a map guiding Gazans to safer areas. The map is divided into neighbourhood numbers indicating where civilians in a specific area should go to avoid being in the crossfire,"" he added.
The IDF has introduced the scheme because it is under heavy pressure from the US to protect civilians. However, our Gaza correspondent says he has spoken to Palestinians in the affected areas who are not aware of the map or cannot see it because there is no internet coverage.
""This is a joke, not a map, because we don't know where to go,"" a displaced person who was sheltering in Khan Younis told him.
Meanwhile, an orthopaedic surgeon at the European Hospital in Khan Younis told the BBC that it was overwhelmed by hundreds of wounded.
""It is chaotic - we can't absorb any more patients and they keep coming,"" Dr Paul Ley said. ""We have more than 360 people on the operating list, which is impossible to deal with.""
Dr Ley also said the hospital's corridors and grounds were full with 6,000 to 7,000 displaced people, some of whom were medics who had fled the north.
""Anaesthetics and pain killers are a big problem - we are running out slowly so we are lowering our safety standards. We never leave the hospital and our presence here has been notified to the Israelis, but shrapnel has reached the hospital,"" he added.
Médecins Sans Frontières also warned that more than 100 dead and over 400 injured people had arrived at the emergency room of Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the last 48 hours, and that there was no space for new patients.
The UN said on Monday that four hospitals in the north were partially operating and admitting patients, with only limited services. The 12 hospitals in the south are partially functional, but bed capacity is only half what it was before the war and only one hospital can perform complex surgery.

Chris Williamson: Former MP's Israel comment prompts hate crime probe,,BBC,By George Torr,"Police are to investigate whether a former MP committed a hate crime in a social media post about Israel.
Chris Williamson, ex-Labour MP for Derby North posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday night that ""Israel has forfeited any right to exist"".
Derbyshire Police said they had received ""multiple reports"" about the comment.
The force said it would now consider whether the post constituted a hate crime.
A spokesperson said: ""The force has received multiple reports relating to a tweet posted by Chris Williamson on the evening of 17 October regarding the Israel/Palestine conflict.
""We take reports of potential hate crimes seriously while also being mindful of freedom of speech and the rights of individuals to express their views.
""Sometimes the opinions will be made robustly and may cause offence but that does not necessarily mean that a law has been broken.
""It is important that we consider all elements of this report and we have recorded a non-crime hate incident to establish if any crime has been committed.
""This will be reviewed in due course and, once a decision has been reached, those who have reported the incident will be contacted directly, and an update posted on the force channels.""
In response, Mr Williamson said accusations of hate crime were ""bogus"".
He also described the complaints as ""an obvious waste of police time"", which he said was itself an offence under the Criminal Law Act.
Mr Williamson was elected as Labour's MP for Derby North in 2010 and re-elected in 2017 after losing the seat to the Conservatives in 2015.
He stood as an independent in 2019 after being suspended by the partyin a row over anti-Semitism.

"Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza extended for two days, Qatar says",,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend the four-day truce in Gaza for another two days, mediator Qatar says.
Hamas said the extension was ""under the same conditions"", which were for 50 Israeli hostages to be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners.
Israel has yet to comment, but it had offered a day's pause in the fighting for every 10 Israeli hostages freed.
It came as 11 hostages were released in the final exchange under the original deal that took effect on Friday.
Israeli officials said three-year-old twins and their mother were among them, along with six more children, an 18-year-old and her mother.
The Israeli military said they had crossed into Israeli territory. However all of the released children's fathers remained in Gaza.
Those freed included people who also held French, German and Argentine nationality, Qatar said.
Thirty-three Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli jails were due to be released under the truce deal.
Hamas - which is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers - has freed 39 Israelis over the previous three days. In exchange, Israel has freed 117 Palestinian prisoners.
Nineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements.
The pause in the fighting is also allowing a big increase in deliveries of aid to Gaza, where there is a deepening humanitarian crisis.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansariannounced on Monday afternoon on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian pause for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip"".
White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US welcomed the extension.
""This humanitarian pause has already brought a halt to the fighting together with a surge of humanitarian assistance. Now, in order to extend the pause Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children over the next two days,"" he said.
""We would of course hope to see the pause extended further and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages.""
Before the start of Monday's exchange, an Israeli official said that 184 people remained in captivity in Gaza, including 14 foreign nationals and 80 Israelis with dual citizenship.
On Sunday, a Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas was prepared to release up to 40 additional hostages, which would mean a four-day extension under the terms offered by Israel.
Israel was reported to be leaning towards a more gradual, day-by-day approach. And it has made it clear that it is preparing to resume the war in Gaza at the end of the process.
""At the end of the outline, we will go to realising our goals with full force: eliminating Hamas, ensuring that Gaza will not go back to being what it was and, of course, releasing all of our hostages,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement on Sunday evening.
Earlier, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the agreement would be extended if Hamas was ""able to prove, to locate, and secure some of the hostages that are within the criteria of the first group, which is women and children"".
But he warned that Hamas's ""very complicated structure"" presented a challenge for Qatari mediators, with the group's political leaders in Doha having to relay information to and from military commanders in Gaza.

Jenin: Israeli military launches major operation in West Bank city,,BBC,By Yolande Knell & David Gritten,"There have been intense exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and armed Palestinian militants in Jenin refugee camp, in the occupied West Bank.
The Israeli military began what appears to be one of its most extensive operations in the territory in years with drone strikes early on Monday.
Nine Palestinians have been killed and 100 injured, health officials say.
Israel said it was putting a stop to Jenin being ""a refuge for terrorism"". Palestinians accused it of a war crime.
The Palestinian Red Crescent says its crews have evacuated 3,000 people - including patients and the elderly - from the camp to hospitals.
It says dozens of people had been detained by Israeli forces in their homes since early Monday, without being provided or allowed any food or drink.
The Israeli military said there was no specific timeline for ending the operation, but that it could be ""a matter of hours or a few days"".
Jenin has become a stronghold of a new generation of Palestinian militants who have become deeply frustrated by the Palestinian Authority's aging leadership and the restrictions of the Israeli occupation.
The city has seen repeated Israeli military raids in the past year as local Palestinians have carried out deadly attacks on Israelis. Other Palestinian attackers have hidden there.
In 2002, during the second Palestinian intifada, Israeli forces launched a full-scale incursion in Jenin. At least 52 Palestinian militants and civilians and 23 Israeli soldiers were killed during 10 days of intense fighting.
Hundreds of Israeli soldiers were still operating inside Jenin on Monday night, more than 20 hours after the operation began.
As well as the hum of drones overhead, regular bursts of gunfire and the loud thuds of explosions came throughout the day from the densely populated refugee camp, which is home to some 18,000 people and is now declared a closed Israeli military zone.
Acrid smoke from burning tyres lit during protests also hung in the air above the city centre. A few young Palestinians were out on the streets, standing close to shuttered shops and staring nervously in the direction of the camp.
The Israeli military has cut off telephone communications and the electricity supply to the camp, making it difficult to get an accurate picture of what is happening. Palestinian medics have also been struggling to reach the dozens of injured there.
At the Palestinian hospital by the main entrance to the camp the mood was grim.
One man told the BBC: ""I met my brother's friend. I went up to him and had barely said a few words when he dropped on the ground. I went to run away, then I got hit by two bullets.""
Another man said there was a ""massacre"" in the camp.
""There are children and civilians and they're not letting them out,"" he added. ""Our electricity is cut, they have dug up all our roads. The camp will be destroyed.""
Jovana Arsenijevic of the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières told the BBC she was at a hospital that had seen more than 90 patients wounded by gunfire or shrapnel from explosive devices.
The Israeli military said it was acting on precise intelligence and did not to seek to harm civilians, but many have been caught in the crossfire.
The military allowed about 500 Palestinian families to leave the camp on Monday night. Some raised their hands or waved makeshift white flags in a gesture of surrender.
People told the BBC that some men and teenaged boys had been stopped by soldiers, and kept behind.
The first drone strike overnight targeted an apartment that the military said was being used as a hideout for Palestinians who had attacked Israelis and as a ""joint operational command centre"" for the Jenin Brigades - a unit made up of different Palestinian militant groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Drones were used for further air strikes and a brigade-size force of troops was deployed in what a military spokesman described as a ""counter-terrorism operation"" focused on seizing weapons and breaking ""the safe haven mindset of the camp, which has become a hornet's nest"".
In the past year and a half, Palestinians behind some 50 attacks targeting Israelis have come from Jenin, according to the military.
As armed Palestinians began fighting back from inside the camp, the Jenin Brigades said: ""We will fight the occupation [Israeli] forces until the last breath and bullet, and we work together and unified from all factions and military formations.""
The Palestinian health ministry said nine Palestinians had been killed by Israeli forces, including three in the overnight drone strike. They all appeared to be young men or in their late teens - some confirmed as belonging to armed groups.
The ministry warned that the death toll might rise because 20 of the injured were in a critical condition.
Another Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire during a related protest near the West Bank city of Ramallah, it added.
The Israeli military said the Palestinians killed in Jenin were affiliated to militant groups.
Troops had also apprehended some 50 militants during the operation, and seized weapons and ammunition, it added.
On Monday evening, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised its forces for entering what he called the ""nest of terrorists"" and asserted that they were doing so ""with minimal injury to civilians"".
""We will continue this action as long as necessary in order to restore quiet and security,"" he added.
There was a furious response to the operation from the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister, Mohammed Shtayyeh.
""What's going on is an attempt to erase the refugee camp completely and displace the residents,"" he said.
Neighbouring Jordan said the operation was ""a clear violation of international humanitarian law"", but the US expressed its support for what it called ""Israel's security and right to defend its people against Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups"".
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the plan was not to expand the military operation outside Jenin, but already Palestinian protests have reached the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip. And the longer this action goes on in Jenin, the greater the risk of another dangerous, wider escalation.
There has been a surge of violence in the West Bank in recent months.
On 20 June, seven Palestinians were killed during an Israeli raid in Jenin which saw the military's first use of an attack helicopter in the West Bank in years.
The next day, two Hamas gunmen shot dead four Israelis near the settlement of Eli, 40km (25 miles) to the south.
A Palestinian man was later shot dead during a rampage by hundreds of settlers in the nearby town of Turmusaya.
That week also saw three Palestinian militants from Jenin killed in a rare Israeli drone strike.
Since the start of the year, more than 140 Palestinians - both militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, while another 36 have been killed in the Gaza Strip.
Twenty-four Israelis, two foreigners and a Palestinian worker have been killed in attacks or apparent attacks by Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank. All were civilians except one off-duty serving soldier and a member of the Israeli security forces.

Gaza-Israel exchange of fire as Israeli forces complete Jenin withdrawal,2023-07-05,BBC,By David Gritten,"Israel has carried out air strikes on Gaza in response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants, as Israeli forces completed their withdrawal from Jenin in the occupied West Bank.
It follows a major two-day operation inside the city's refugee camp which killed 12 Palestinians.
An Israeli soldier was also killed on Tuesday night during the withdrawal, which triggered more gun battles.
Early on Wednesday, the military said it intercepted five rockets from Gaza.
Shrapnel from one of the interceptor missiles damaged a house in the southern Israeli town of Sderot.
No militant group immediately claimed that it was behind the launches, but the Israeli military said fighter jets struck an underground weapons manufacturing facility used by Hamas, which governs Gaza, as well as a raw materials manufacturing facility for rockets.
The military said it held ""the Hamas terrorist organisation responsible for all terror activities emanating from the Gaza Strip and will face the consequences of security violations against Israel"".
On Tuesday afternoon, Hamas described a car-ramming and stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv as a ""natural response"" to the Jenin operation.
Israeli authorities said seven people were injured on a busy shopping street and that the attacker was a Palestinian man from the West Bank. He was shot dead by a civilian.
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: ""Whoever thinks that such an attack will deter us from continuing our fight against terrorism is mistaken.""
He also warned that the Jenin operation would not be a ""one-time action"".
""We will continue as long as necessary to uproot terrorism. We will not allow Jenin to go back to being a city of refuge for terrorism,"" he added.
Palestinian leaders accused Israel of mounting an ""invasion"" in Jenin.
An Israeli military spokesman told the BBC on Wednesday morning that ""the operation is officially over, and the soldiers have left the Jenin area"".
The military launched its operation in Jenin refugee camp early on Monday with a drone strike that it said targeted a joint command centre of the Jenin Brigades - a unit made up of different militant groups, including Hamas.
Drones carried out further air strikes as hundreds of troops entered the camp and engaged in intense gun battles with armed Palestinians inside the camp.
The military said the ""counter-terrorism operation"" was focused on seizing weapons and ""breaking the safe haven mindset of the camp"".
At a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the UN's humanitarian office said it was ""alarmed at the scale of air and ground operations that are taking place in Jenin and continuing today in the West Bank, and especially [the] air strikes hitting a densely populated refugee camp"".
She said the Palestinian health ministry had confirmed that three children - two 17-year-old boys and a 16-year-old boy - were among those killed, and warned that damage to infrastructure meant most of the camp now had no drinking water or electricity.
The World Health Organization said Palestinian ambulance crews had been prevented from entering parts of the camp, including to reach people who were critically injured. The health ministry has said more than 140 Palestinians have been injured, 30 of them critically.
A Palestinian Red Crescent official said about 3,000 Palestinians, including many sick and elderly, were allowed overnight to flee the drone strikes and gun battles between Israeli troops and armed Palestinians.
A man in a wheelchair who was escorted out of the camp with his family in the morning told the BBC that they had been held in a room by Israeli troops.
""We were encircled by a military barricade. Israeli soldiers came. Now we just went out. There were no people left in the camp. We were the only ones.""
He added: ""It's been a very difficult situation. The drone was shooting at us. Now we've just left. And we're all tired. We've had no food... No drink.""
Outside a hospital in the nearby city centre, Palestinians protesters threw stones at an Israeli military vehicle, prompting it to fire tear gas in response.
Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières complained that paramedics had been forced to proceed on foot because Israeli military bulldozers had destroyed many roads, stripping them of tarmac.
In an interview with CNN on Tuesday night, chief military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that no non-combatants had been killed during the operation.
He also said he had seen ambulances driving freely inside the camp during the day, adding: ""We are assisting those ambulances to evacuate the wounded.""
The admiral said bulldozers had dug up about 2km (1.2 miles) of roads inside the camp along which militants had concealed explosive devices, putting civilians and troops at risk.
Jenin has become a stronghold of a new generation of Palestinian militants who have become deeply frustrated by the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority's aging leadership and the restrictions of the Israeli occupation.
The city has seen repeated Israeli military raids in the past year as local Palestinians have carried out deadly attacks on Israelis. Other Palestinian attackers have hidden there.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh rejected statements from foreign governments saying that Israel had the right to defend itself.
""Israel is internationally recognised as the occupying power over our land and people,"" he tweeted. ""[It] should be condemned for its use of force to destroy the camp's infrastructure, facilities, and homes, and to kill, arrest, and displace innocent people.""
""It is the Palestinian people that have the right to self-defence. There is no such right for an occupying power,"" he added.

Rocket kills woman in Israel as strikes target Gaza militant commanders,2023-05-11,BBC,By Raffi Berg and Rushdi Abu Alouf,"The Israeli military has killed two Palestinian Islamic Jihad commanders in air strikes in Gaza during a third day of fighting with militants there.
A pre-dawn attack on an apartment in Khan Younis killed the head of PIJ's rocket-launching force and two others, who the military said were militants.
In the afternoon, his deputy was killed in a strike in a nearby town.
Later, one woman was killed when a rocket fired from Gaza hit a building in the central Israeli city of Rehovot.
It was the first fatality in Israel since it began an operation against PIJ on Tuesday morning with a series of air strikes that killed another three of the group's commanders.
Twenty-nine people have been killed and 93 injured in Gaza over the same period, health officials there say. At least 10 civilians are also among the dead, which the United Nations has called unacceptable.
The Israeli military said four people, including three children, were killed in Gaza by rockets falling short on Wednesday, though this has not been corroborated by Palestinian sources. PIJ denied the allegation and accused Israel of trying to evade responsibility for their deaths.
Militants have launched at least 803 rockets since Wednesday, 620 of which have crossed into Israeli territory, the Israeli military says. Some have hit buildings, but most have landed in open areas or been intercepted. It says it has hit 191 PIJ sites since Tuesday.
On Thursday night a barrage of rockets reached the area around Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial capital, about 60km (37 miles) north of Gaza, with no immediate reports of injuries.
The early morning Israeli air strike in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, destroyed an apartment at the top of a six-storey building and damaged the apartment below it.
Abdullah Samir Hummaid, whose apartment in a neighbouring building was also damaged, said he had just got into bed when ""two explosions sounded within a few seconds"".
The PIJ confirmed that the head of its missile unit, Ali Hassan Ghali, also known as Abu Mohammed, was killed the attack, which it described as a ""treacherous Zionist assassination"".
The Hamas-run health ministry said three people were killed and seven others injured. Palestinian media reported that the two other dead were Ghali's brother and nephew.
The PIJ is the second biggest militant group in Gaza after Hamas, which controls the territory, and has been responsible for many of the rocket attacks on Israel in recent years.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had targeted Ghali and what it called two ""other Islamic Jihad operatives in Gaza"" in their ""hideout"".
It said Ghali had been ""responsible for the recent rocket barrages launched against Israel"".
Later on Thursday, militants began firing mortars and rockets at Israeli communities near the Gaza perimeter fence, damaging two homes in the Eshkol Regional Council area.
The IDF said it struck a number of targets belonging to PIJ in response to the rocket fire before it announced in the late afternoon that it had killed the deputy head of the group's rocket-launching force, Ahmed Abu Daqqa, in an attack in the town of Bani Suheila, near Khan Younis.
It said Abu Daqqa ""took a significant part"" in carrying out the rocket barrages over the past two days.
PIJ also confirmed Abu Daqqa's death, while local health officials four people were wounded in the strike.
""Anyone who comes to harm us - blood on his head, and also blood on the head of his replacement,"" warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to a military base.
Not long afterwards, Palestinian health officials reported that another two people were killed in the Shejaiya area of Gaza City.
Several barrages of rockets were also launched towards communities in southern and central Israel, triggering sirens and causing residents to run to shelters.
""We've got 30 seconds to literally get in [the safe room],"" Beverly Jamil, who lives in Ashkelon, 12km north of Gaza, told the BBC .
""You can be anywhere - parking the car, in the middle of cooking, in the shower, you've got 30 seconds to get in here, close the door and wait and we have to make sure that we're all in, ie the whole family, me, my husband, my two girls and the three dogs.""
Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service said there was a direct hit on an apartment building in Rehovot, about 21km south of Tel Aviv, killing one person. It said five people have been wounded by rockets and 16 injured running to shelters since the rocket fire began on Wednesday.
Earlier, a spokeswoman for UN Secretary General António Guterres said he condemned ""the civilian loss of life, including that of children and women, which he views as unacceptable"".
This week's fighting is the heaviest since three days of hostilities between Israel and PIJ last August, in which 49 Palestinians were killed in Gaza.
Meanwhile, tensions remain high in the occupied West Bank.
The Palestinian health ministry there said a 66-year-old Palestinian man was killed by Israeli forces during a raid on the Nur Shams refugee camp, near Tulkarm. The IDF said its troops returned fire after one was shot and lightly wounded by gunmen.

Update 12 May 2023: This story has been updated to say that the Israeli civilian killed in Rehovot was a woman and not a man, as initial reports stated.

President Joe Biden's foreign policy upended by Hamas attack,,BBC,By Barbara Plett Usher,"The scope of Hamas's attack against Israel was unprecedented and the US response reflects that.
It already supplies its Middle East ally with $3.8bn (£3.1bn) of military aid every year.
And it has always backed Israel's right to defend itself when conflicts with Hamas erupt, albeit intervening with ceasefire calls after a few days or weeks of Israeli air strikes.
But this Hamas offensive will trigger a wide-ranging Israeli campaign and could lead to an escalation in other parts of the region.
The US will be part of Israel's lengthy and punishing response.
The Pentagon has quickly dispatched an aircraft carrier with guided-missile cruisers and destroyers to the waters near Israel.
The fleet was already in the Mediterranean Sea, so didn't have far to go. It is not unusual for the US to deploy naval vessels in the region when there are flare-ups, a ""classic American response to the unexpected in the Middle East,"" says Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer and Middle East adviser to four presidents.
It hasn't done so during previous battles between Hamas and Israel, which have been self-contained. But this isn't about Hamas. The Pentagon is worried the conflict may spread.
A senior defence official said the warships and planes are meant to demonstrate a concrete commitment to Israel's defence, and to deter any country or militant group from joining the fight.
Chiefly that means Iran, which backs Lebanon's powerful Hizbollah movement, as well as Hamas.
The official said the fleet could do everything from gathering intelligence to launching long range strikes. But its deployment is essentially a show of force.
The Biden administration has ordered the Pentagon to send ""additional equipment and resources"" to Israel. That includes air defence and munitions.
Much of this equipment is already in the pipeline from annual US military assistance to Israel, and will be fast tracked. Some of it could come from existing US stockpiles.
But Israel's request for aid on the first day of the war signals how much firepower it expects to use in what it's signalling is going to be a long war.
Further funding would require approval from Congress, which is currently paralysed by an internal battle over who will be the next Speaker of the House.
And it might compete with US commitments to Ukraine. These already stand at more than $46bn (£37.5bn) since the war there began - although the senior defence official said the US has the resources to support both.
It's unlikely that deploying the aircraft carrier fleet will increase the risk of drawing the US directly into conflict, says Seth Jones, a security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
But the urgent attention on Israel ""may take some of the focus off of other theatres, like Ukraine,"" he says, at least in the short term.
A big part of that will be the fate of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas, both in terms of how the conflict plays out on the ground and in US politics.
President Biden has said it's likely American citizens are among them and plans to deploy experts and share intelligence to assist recovery efforts.
More broadly, the war has upended the core of his Middle East policy - a new regional security alignment between Israel and Saudi Arabia that would have further isolated Iran.
That deal is now on pause, with a future that may grow even more uncertain if, as expected, Palestinian casualties mount in Gaza.
""That will mean Arab states will have to criticise Israel very strongly,"" says Bruce Riedel, suggesting some who have already signed normalisation agreements with Israel may ""flip"".
That concern was implicit in the Pentagon's characterisation of the attack as a new ""Isis-level savagery"" from Hamas.
The Department of Defense is stressing that language because across the region ""there's been an instinct to see this as the same kind of tensions or conflicts that we've seen between Palestinians and Israelis,"" said the defence official. ""This is different.""
A lot of Palestinians in Gaza will die if Israel carries out a lengthy and ferocious air and possibly ground campaign to dismantle Hamas.
In previous battles between Israel and the militant group, which governs the densely populated enclave, the US has eventually drawn a line, urging Israel to accept a ceasefire. But the goalposts have changed.
No Arab state has ever imposed this kind of civilian damage on Israel, says Mr Riedel. The surprise attack from Egypt and Syria in 1973 was just as much of a shock, but most of the casualties were soldiers.
""Now they're fighting inside Israel proper,"" he says, with hundreds of civilians dead.
According to the senior defence official, the US holds Israel to robust standards and monitoring procedures for the protection of civilians, applied to all who purchase US weapons.
But, the official said, ""that's absolutely something that Hamas did not do"" and ""we recognize that there's going to need to be a response for Israel to restore deterrence"".

Few reasons for optimism after Antony Blinken's diplomatic dash,2023-11-05,BBC,By Anthony Zurcher,"For three days, the US's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, has been dashing around the Middle East, trying to contain a situation that threatens to spin out of control.
Israel on Friday. Jordan on Saturday. The West Bank, Iraq and Turkey on Sunday.
Every stop posed its own challenges and gave reason to be pessimistic that much progress is being made. The central challenge facing the US secretary of state is that he is trying to find a middle ground where none, at the moment, exists.
On Friday, Mr Blinken encouraged Israeli leaders to make temporary pauses in hostilities in order to ease humanitarian aid and encourage hostage releases - a move the Israeli prime minister quickly rejected.
The next day, he met representatives of Israel's Arab neighbours. They all called for an immediate ceasefire. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Israel was committing war crimes.
At roughly the same time back in the US, President Joe Biden was asked whether progress was being made toward securing those humanitarian pauses. He gave a thumbs up and replied ""good"".
The president's optimism stood in stark contrast to the mood on the ground here in the Middle East.
As if to underscore the tension in the region, Mr Blinken's Sunday stops were done under cover of secrecy. He travelled to Ramallah to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in a convoy of armoured SUVs and vans, speeding through streets cordoned off by soldiers from the Palestinian Palace Guard.
He arrived in Iraq under cover of darkness. The secretary and his diplomatic entourage donned body armour and helmets for the short helicopter ride from the Baghdad airport to the US embassy, where he then motorcaded to a meeting with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani.
On Monday, he will meet Turkish officials - just one day after Turkey's President, Recip Erdogan, recalled his country's ambassador to Israel and said he was done dealing with Mr Netanyahu. ""We have erased him, thrown him out,"" the Turkish leader said.
Every time Mr Blinken puts one fire out, another seems to pop up.
I asked Mr Blinken at the Baghdad airport if he shared the US president's optimism about the chances of convincing Israel to agree to pauses and in getting the Arabs to accept that a ceasefire is unrealistic at this point.
He said yes to both.
The Americans are continuing to work with the Israelis to address concerns about the ""specifics and the practicalities"" of how humanitarian pauses could be implemented.
As for the Arabs, he said there were differences of opinion on a ceasefire, but everyone he had spoken with believed humanitarian pauses could help win the release of hostages, increase aid distribution in Gaza and expedite getting foreign citizens out of Gaza.
""We've had important progress there in recent days,"" he said, but ""there are also real complications that come along with it.""
For the moment, however, no one seems to be buying what Mr Blinken is selling, in part because both the Israelis and the Arab nations are dealing with their own domestic pressures pulling the two sides apart.
On Friday, as Mr Blinken stood before press cameras with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in central Tel Aviv, chants and horns could be heard - the sound of Israeli protesters calling for the government to do more to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October.
""Our heart goes out to them,"" Mr Herzog said.
Meanwhile, in countries across the region - and in Europe and the US - pro-Palestinian protesters have taken to the street en masse. Demonstrators climbed the fence outside the White House in Washington DC and filled the streets in Paris, London and Berlin.
In Istanbul, protesters held up a sign that called Mr Blinken ""an accomplice of the massacre"".
If a positive spin can be put on Mr Blinken's trip so far, it's that he is speaking with all sides and, for the moment, the conflict has not spread. After Joe Biden's October meeting with Arab leaders in Jordan was abruptly cancelled following the explosion at a Gaza hospital, Mr Blinken's foreign minister gathering on Saturday was an indication of some progress.
However, the secretary of state's attempts to encourage his Arab counterparts to start thinking about the long-term future for the Palestinians, and a means to ensure a ""durable"" peace in the region, were less successful.
""How can we even entertain what will happen in Gaza when we do not know what kind of Gaza will be left after this war is done?"" Jordan's Mr Safadi asked. ""Are we going to be talking about a wasteland? Are we going to be talking about a whole population reduced to refugees?""
In a meeting with Jewish community leaders at the White House on 12 October, Joe Biden said he thought that the end result of the tragedy and bloodshed in Israel and Gaza would be a Middle East that was changed for the better.
""But then again, I have been referred to as a congenital optimist,"" the US president added.
On the ground here in the region, such optimism has proven to be a rare commodity.

"'As Palestinian youths, the political process has failed us'",2023-06-12,BBC,By Yousef Eldin,"Palestinians under the age of 30 have never had a chance to vote in an election and many say they have little faith in the Palestinian leadership. Exclusive data shared with the BBC suggests they are increasingly rejecting the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
""The very clichéd 'two-state solution' - Western-made, without looking at the real situation,"" 17-year-old Janna Tamimi responds disparagingly when asked about it, adding: ""But where are the borders?""
Janna says she is one of the youngest accredited journalists in the world. At the age of seven she began borrowing her mother's phone and covering protests in her hometown of Nabi Salah in the occupied West Bank.
""I've been reporting the [Israeli forces'] night raids and the day raids that happen pretty often. I don't film all of them, but I try my best. It's been a bit hard with school and everything. But there's always something to cover.""
Since Janna was born there has not been a single general or presidential election in the Palestinian territories. The last one took place in 2006, which means anyone under 34 years old has never had the opportunity to vote.
What has followed is a collapse of trust in the Palestinian political leadership and a downward spiral of support for the two-state solution, the internationally backed formula for peace envisaging an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.
The West Bank-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research has tracked the changing views of the population for over two decades and has shared data exclusively with the BBC on 18 to 29-year-olds.
The findings demonstrate clear trends in this generation's declining support for the governing Palestinian Authority (PA) and a consistent drop in support for a two-state solution over the last decade.
""Today, the youth discontent is driven to a large extent by the lack of legitimacy that they see in the political system. So we have a president, who, for the last 14 years has been ruling without electoral legitimacy,"" explains Dr Khalil Shikaki, the director of the centre.
""Our political system is largely authoritarian; it is largely a one-man show. In theory, we have a constitution, but in reality, we're not observing our constitution.""
At the same time, support for armed confrontation is highest amongst under 30-year-olds, with over 56% supporting a return to an intifada, or uprising, against Israel, according to the most recent poll in March.
In the past year, numerous new militant groups have sprung up in the northern West Bank towns of Nablus and Jenin, challenging the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority's security forces.
The most well-known are the Lions' Den and the Jenin Brigades, which have carried out attacks in the West Bank against Israeli forces and settlers.
We join the Jenin Brigades at 02:00 one night as they carry out training exercises in the labyrinthine streets of the Jenin refugee camp.
Each member is armed with an M16 assault rifle and dressed head to toe in black as they silently make their way in a single line formation. Their guns point forward scanning alleys and rooftops as they move.
Mostly men in their 20s, these fighters claim to be independent of major militant groups and have publicly rejected links to political parties in the Palestinian territories.
One of the fighters, Mujahed, 28, tells us that his generation is not represented by the current leadership.
""The youth of Palestine have lost hope with the political methods of the past 30 years,"" he says.
Does he support violence as a solution?
""This occupation enters here daily and kills in cold blood, in broad daylight,"" he says, referring to Israeli forces. ""This occupation only understands the language of force.""
In the absence of a general or presidential election, the student elections in universities are a barometer of the political temperature. Birzeit University in the West Bank and its student elections are widely regarded as a reflection of the political mood in the territories.
The change of sentiments is evident here too. The student Fatah party, the youth wing of the dominant party in the Palestinian Authority, has always held out against opposition Islamist parties, including Fatah's main rival Hamas. But that changed last year.
""It was a shock,"" explains Mustafa, a student representative for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine party that also stood in the 2022 student elections.
""Usually, the difference between Fatah and the Hamas factions is one or two seats. This time it was 10 for Hamas.""
The unprecedented landslide win for Hamas in these student elections is largely seen as a protest against the Palestinian Authority, a feat which was repeated last month, albeit with a slightly reduced majority.
""Of course, if there were general elections, they would yield the same results as the ones in Birzeit,"" Mustafa continues, ""because people are fed up with the way the Palestinian Authority is dealing with things, whether it ispolitical detentions, taxes, killings or the smothering of freedom of expression"".
For many who have grown up with no voice in the future of the Palestinian territories, it has raised questions about identity.
Majd Nasrallah works as a curator at the Qattan Foundation, an independent organisation working in culture and education. He is based in the West Bank city of Ramallah but was born in the town of Qanalsuwa, in central Israel.
Palestinian citizens make up 20% of Israel's population and like many in his generation he prefers to identify as ""from '48"" - a term that describes Palestinians who remained in the land which became Israel following its creation in 1948. As a result, he finds himself excluded from Palestinian society.
""I'm not recognised as part of the Palestinian system in the West Bank,"" Majd continues. ""I'm not supposed to vote [in Palestinian elections]. Actually, according to Israeli law, I'm not even supposed to be here [in Ramallah].""
Israeli law prohibits citizens from travelling to Palestinian areas in the West Bank for security reasons.
Without a voice in the Palestinian political process, Majd also has no faith in the two-state solution.
""The two-state solution is really a corpse of a political project that is usually used as a fig leaf for the continued oppression of Palestinians,"" he says.
""It's not about a state, if you ask me. A five-year-old can take a look at the map and tell you that this doesn't work.""
The future of a two-state solution is in question if a generation who have most at stake in it are increasingly rejecting it as a viable option.
I ask Majd what he could imagine hoping for.
""For the longest time, I was an advocate for the 'one democratic state' solution [encompassing Israel and the Palestinian territories],"" he says. ""Over at least the last decade, there have been so many attempts to voice our discontent with this current form of governance, which have been completely repressed. I can say with a full heart, the PA does not represent the voice of not only my generation, but Palestinians at large.""
The Palestinian Authority did not respond to a request for a reply to issues raised in this article.

London doctor in Gaza says hospital ceiling fell in after blast,2023-10-18,BBC,By Yasmin Rufo,"A surgeon from London working in Gaza has described the moments after a huge blast hit the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital.
Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a plastic surgeon from north London, told the BBC that parts of the hospital in Gaza City were on fire.
He added: ""There's broken glass everywhere, there are lots of people who are seeking refuge in the hospital.""
Authorities in Gaza say almost 500 people have died in the explosion.
Speaking shortly after the blast on Tuesday evening, Dr Abu-Sittah said: ""We were operating in the hospital, there was a strong explosion and the ceiling fell on the operating room.
""This is a massacre.""
He said he had been working every day until 1am in dire conditions, with children comprising 40% of the patients he has seen.
He added that resources were running out fast with water pressure now insufficient to supply some of the equipment.
Dr Abu-Sittah previously told the BBChow the Met Police turned up at his home in London to question his wife.
He said that to have his family ""harassed in this way is just bizarre"".
The Met Police said Dr Abu-Sittah's home was visited by officers because the force received a report that ""a man was planning to travel to a warzone"".

Israel orders Khan Younis evacuation in southern Gaza,,BBC,By Oliver Slow,"Israel has told Palestinians in Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, to leave their homes.
The city hosts hundreds of thousands who fled northern Gaza as Israel began a ground operation against Hamas.
The new order suggests the military operations could soon move towards the south of the Gaza Strip.
Israel says the aim is to wipe out Hamas, following its attack on Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 12,000 people have been killed by Israel since then, including 5,000 children.
On Saturday, Israeli missiles struck a residential building in Khan Younis, killing 26 people, a local health official said.
Israel has not yet commented on the incident.
But it has been dropping leaflets in the wider area, urging people to leave for shelters.
""We're asking people to relocate. I know it's not easy for many of them, but we don't want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire,"" Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told US network MSNBC on Friday.
Israel did not want to see ""civilians caught up in the crossfire"", Mr Regev said.
He said Israeli troops would need to advance into the city to remove Hamas fighters from underground tunnels, adding he was ""pretty sure"" those being urged to relocate ""won't have to move again"" if they head west, towards the Mediterranean Sea.
Mr Regev said the areas they were being asked to move to would ""hopefully have tents and a field hospital"", although no such plans have yet been publicised, and it is unclear if such facilities would be able to accommodate potentially well over a million evacuees.
Because the western areas are close to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, humanitarian aid could be brought in ""as quickly as possible"", Mr Regev said.
Like elsewhere in the Gaza Strip, southern Gaza has been in the grip of a humanitarian crisis since 7 October, when Israel enforced a full-scale blockage.
There have been widespread reports of water, food and fuel shortages, as well as concerns about healthcare facilities and sanitation conditions.
Israel has launched near-constant air strikes across much of the Gaza Strip, as well as a ground incursion into northern Gaza, including reducing much of Gaza City - the enclave's largest city - to rubble.
The UN estimates that at least 1.5 million people in Gaza are internally displaced, with overcrowding a major concern. Many are sheltering in UN facilities, as well as hospitals, churches and public buildings.
Much of the recent fighting has centred on Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital, where Israel says Hamas has been operating a command-and-control centre, which Hamas denies. Israel is yet to provide substantial evidence to back its claim.
Hundreds of people are reported to have left al-Shifa on Saturday, with one journalist who left the hospital telling the BBC ""we raised our hands and carried white flags"".
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have denied ordering an evacuation of the hospital, but said it had agreed to a request from a hospital director and was providing a ""secure route"" for those wishing to leave.
Hamas officials say 120 patients remain at the hospital, along with premature babies.
There are also reports that a UN school-turned-shelter in northern Gaza has been hit, with many casualties.
The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip told the AFP news agency that at least 50 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Fakhoura school.
BBC Verify has geolocated footage to the school that shows many people - including women and children - with severe injuries or lying motionless on the floor in different parts of the building.
There are more than 20 such casualties visible in the footage, and around half of these are seen in one particular room on the ground floor, which also shows signs of considerable damage.
An IDF spokesman told the BBC that he could not confirm it was an IDF strike and was looking into the incident.
The head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) Philippe Lazzarini said he had seen ""horrifying images and footage of scores of people killed and injured"" in one of his agency's schools ""sheltering thousands of displaced"".
""These attacks cannot become commonplace, they must stop,"" he said.

Israel Gaza war: History of the conflict explained,,BBC,,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.
About 1,200 people were killed, while the Israeli military says more than 200 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.
More than 14,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.
Britain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One.
The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups.
Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people.
This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.
The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.
To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.
Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.
Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.
In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city.
That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.
In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.
It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.
Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, orthe ""Catastrophe""
By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory.
Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza.
Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.
Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.
In a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.
Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.
Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.
In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.
Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.
Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.
Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.
In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.
Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.
Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.
There are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on.
These include:
Israel-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.
A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.
In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.
Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.
The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.
In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented.
Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.
The mostrecent peace plan - prepared by the USwhen Donald Trump was president - was called ""the deal of the century"" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.
Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.
Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.
Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities.
Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.
This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.
These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.
But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.
The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.
The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition.
It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.
Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.
Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.
Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however,denied any involvement.

"Israelis, united in shock, rally behind war to punish Hamas",2023-10-09,BBC,By Jeremy Bowen,"On the car radio the main news channel was full of the new reality, with freshly recorded stings for the hourly bulletins.
""Israel at War"" boomed a bass voice, punctuating reports of continued fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas infiltrators, and air raid alarms close to the border with Lebanon. On the other side of the fence is Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed Lebanese militia that is Israel's most formidable enemy.
The prospect that it might enter a two-front war is Israel's strategic nightmare.
Outside a military base on the highway that goes south to Gaza hundreds of cars were parked along both hard shoulders and on the central reservation. They were left by reservists who had reported for duty. More were arriving.
A man standing next to the open tailgate of his hatchback pulled on a crumpled olive-green army shirt. He fished around inside the back to find his body armour, slammed the door, and went to join the rest of his reserve unit.
A middle-aged couple had managed to meet up with their son, a young man of around 20 who is doing his compulsory military service. The mother handed over a jar of home-made pickles.
The father said: ""We've told him to concentrate on what he has to do, and not to think too hard about friends who've been hurt and killed.""
More armed men have entered Israel through breaches in the wire that was designed by Israel to contain Hamas.
Israelis are incredulous that their army is taking so long to regain control of the land and villages bordering Gaza. One unit appealed on social media for drones, others have asked for sleeping bags and food.
Israel's military is powerful, well capable of driving Hamas back. But its failure to do so thus far is reinforcing the conviction that the country's lavishly-funded and prestigious military and intelligence establishment should have stopped a catastrophe and did not.
Constant comparisons are being made between the events of the last few days and the war exactly 50 years ago, that started in October 1973 after a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria.
Golda Meir, the prime minister at the time, ignored warnings that an attack was coming on a Jewish holiday, and was condemned for hubris and complacency.
The same accusations are already being thrown at her successor Benjamin Netanyahu, by his many political enemies.
Israel is still bitterly divided about Mr Netanyahu, whose government's extreme right-wing agenda prompted months of protests.
But citizens of all political persuasion are rallying behind their flag. With Israel officially at war the protests are suspended, and reservists who refused to turn up for duty are now queuing to return.
Israelis, collectively, are reeling from the shock of the Hamas attack.
As survivors and victims tell their stories, the desire deepens to punish Hamas for the way its men went from house-to-house killing families and children in Israeli border communities. As we drive, callers phoning in to the radio are talking about parents who had calls from their terrified children at the rave in the desert whereHamas massacred hundreds of civilians.
They're haunted that parents heard the shots that killed their sons and daughters.
""Israel at War"", the sting comes again, with a report from the Israeli minister of defence Yoav Gallant, a former general, speaking somewhere in southern Israel. ""We're fighting animals,"" he says, ""and we'll act accordingly."" Food, water and power supplies to Gaza are being cut.
My phone pings. A post on the BBC Jerusalem office WhatsApp group says that a market in Gaza has been hit and many killed as Israel attacked what it said was a Hamas target. The video of broken bodies feels like a harbinger of something even worse.
The scale of the bloodshed inflicted on Israel by Hamas is unprecedented. An organisation that planned its attack so carefully will have been aware that Israel's response would be ferocious.
Israel's war plans will be complicated by the presence of around 100 hostages taken in the attack. But one cabinet minister, according to a cabinet leak reported in the Israeli press, has said that should not hold them back.
This feels very different to the regular confrontations Israel and Hamas have had since the militant group took over Gaza in 2007. They were serious enough.
Over the years Israel caused immense damage and inflicted thousands of casualties on Palestinian civilians. But they had fallen into a familiar pattern and felt at times like deadly rituals.
Now both sides are in unknown territory.

Tribute to Scottish victim of Hamas attack on Israel,2023-10-09,BBC,,"Tributes have been paid to a grandfather who has been confirmed as the first Scottish victim of the Hamas assault on Israel.
Bernard Cowan grew up in the Glasgow area and settled in Israel where he lived with his wife and three children.
More than 700 people have been killed in Israel since Saturday and over 500 people have died in Gaza.
Mr Cowan is among more than 10 British citizens feared dead, or missing.
He was identified by family members on social media as having been killed in the attack.
In a statement his family said: ""We are grieving the loss of our son and brother, Bernard Cowan, who was horrifically murdered on Saturday during the surprise terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas.
""We ask for privacy at this time while we process this huge loss to our family, both at home and in Israel, and to the Jewish community in Glasgow where he will be sorely missed.""
Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousafsaid his own in-laws are ""trapped"" in Gaza, as he unequivocally condemned the attacks by Hamas.
Nathanel Young, 20, who was serving with the Israel Defense Forces, is the only other Briton confirmed to have died.
But the BBC understands photographer Dan Darlington is thought by his family to be dead.
Sammy Stein, chairman of Glasgow Friends of Israel, runs a peace advocacy stall and knew Mr Cowan.
He told BBC Scotland News: ""Bernard went to live in Israel and he lived very near the border, I mean just metres away from the Gaza border, which to him was an incredible place to live.
""It was quiet, it was peaceful and it was in the country. He loved it.""
Mr Stein said Mr Cowan returned to Glasgow regularly and always stopped at his stall on the city's Buchanan Street to update campaigners on the situation in the Middle East.
He described news of his death as ""really, really dreadful"" and admitted it was difficult to process.
Mr Stein added: ""Many people were killed and injured but when it's somebody that you know personally it is a lot more difficult to understand, comprehend and accept.""
He said Mr Cowan would be remembered during a mourning evening on Monday at Giffnock Synagogue.
A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on individual consular cases.
""However we can confirm we are in contact with - and assisting - the families of several individuals in Israel and the OPTs.
""The safety of all British nationals continues to be our utmost priority and we urge everyone to continue to follow our travel advice which is updated regularly.""

Iyad Halaq: Israeli court acquits officer who killed autistic Palestinian man,,BBC,By David Gritten,"An Israeli court has acquitted a border police officer charged with recklessly killing an autistic Palestinian man in occupied East Jerusalem in 2020.
Iyad Halaq, 32, was shot as he walked to his special needs school. Police said the unnamed officer thought he was carrying a weapon and opened fire when he failed to obey orders to stop.
The Jerusalem district court found that the officer ""made an honest mistake"".
Halaq's mother condemned the verdict as ""a particular injustice"".
But Israel's police commissioner and national security minister welcomed it.
Iyad Halaq's family said he was on the low-functioning end of the autism spectrum and that he had trouble communicating.
He would walk every day from his home in Jerusalem's Wadi al-Joz area to the Old City to go to a centre for children and adults with disabilities.
On the day that Halaq was killed in May 2020, officers at a border police position near the Old City suspected that he was planning to carry out an attack, the Jerusalem District Court said in its decision.
He ran away when the officers approached him and ordered him to stop, it added.
According to the court, the defendant joined the pursuit with another officer and shot Halaq in the leg after he entered an alley and tried to hide in a rubbish storage room.
The defendant shot Halaq in the chest after he got up and pointed towards his female school counsellor, who was trying to protect him, the court said.
The indictment alleged that the defendant ""fired at [Halaq's] upper body, thereby taking an unreasonable risk of causing his death"", even though Halaq was wounded, had nothing in his hands, and had done nothing to justify it.
But the court accepted the defendant's claim that he was acting in self-defence.
He made ""an honest mistake [believing] he was faced with an armed terrorist"" and ""did not know [Halaq] was an innocent man with special needs"", it said.
Following the verdict, Halaq's mother Rana told the AFP news agency: ""My son is now in the grave and his killer is relaxing and going out and having a good time.""
The Palestinian foreign ministry said the acquittal was ""further evidence that the Israeli judicial system is part of the occupation system"".
Israel Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai - who was commander of the border police force at the time - said the killing of Halaq was ""unfortunate"" but that he believed the court's decision was ""correct"".
In a separate development on Thursday, an Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt Shilo Yosef Amir, was shot dead by a Palestinian in an attack near the settlement of Kedumim, in the occupied West Bank, the military said.
The gunman attempted to flee the scene but was killed by other soldiers.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas praised the attack as a ""response"" to Israel's major two-day military operation in the West Bank city of Jenin earlier this week, during which 12 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed.

Hamas: Who are the group's most prominent leaders?,2023-10-17,BBC,By Lina Alshawabkeh,"Since Hamas blindsided Israel with its most ambitious attack ever launched from Gaza, questions have been raised over who masterminded the deadly invasion.
Many of the highest-ranking men belonging to the militant Palestinian group controlling Gaza keep a low public profile, while others have spent much of their lives evading assassination attempts by Israel.
These are Hamas's most prominent leaders.
Ismail Haniyeh is widely considered Hamas's overall leader.
A prominent member of the movement in the late 1980s, Israel imprisoned Haniyeh for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the first Palestinian uprising.
He was then exiled in 1992 to a no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon, along with a number of Hamas leaders.
After a year in exile, he returned to Gaza. In 1997 he was appointed head of the office of Hamas's spiritual leader, strengthening his position.
Haniyeh was appointed Palestinian prime minister in 2006 by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections, but was dismissed a year later after the group ousted Mr Abbas' Fatah party from the Gaza Strip in a week of deadly violence.
Haniyeh rejected his sacking as ""unconstitutional"", stressing that his government ""would not abandon its national responsibilities towards the Palestinian people"", and continued to rule in Gaza.
He was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017.
In 2018, the US Department of State designated Haniyeh a terrorist. He has lived in Qatar for the past several years.
The leader of the Hamas movement within the Gaza Strip, Yahya Sinwar, was born in 1962.
He is the founder of the Hamas security service known as Majd, which manages internal security matters, investigates suspected Israeli agents and tracks down Israeli intelligence and security services officers.
Sinwar has been arrested three times. After his third arrest in 1988 he was sentenced to four life terms in prison.
However, he was among 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released by Israel in exchange for an Israeli soldier held captive for over five years by Hamas.
Sinwar returned to his position as a prominent leader in Hamas and was appointed head of the group's political bureau in the Gaza Strip in 2017.
In 2015, the US included Sinwar on its blacklist of ""international terrorists"".
Mohammed Deif leads the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement.
He is a shadowy figure known to Palestinians as The Mastermind, and to Israelis as The Cat with Nine Lives.
Israeli authorities imprisoned him in 1989, after which he formed the al-Qassam Brigades with the aim of capturing Israeli soldiers.
After his release, he helped engineer the construction oftunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to get inside Israel from Gaza,
Deif is one of Israel's most-wanted men, accused of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s.
Israel imprisoned him in 2000, but he escaped at the beginning of the second Palestinian uprising, or intifada.
Since then, he has left behind little trace. There are three known pictures of him: one is dated, he is masked in the second, and the third is of his shadow.
The most serious assassination attempts on his life were in 2002: Deif survived but lost one of his eyes. Israel says he also lost a foot and a hand, and that he has difficulty speaking.
Israeli security forces again failed to assassinate Deif during a 2014 assault on the Gaza Strip, but killed his wife and two of his children.
Marwan Issa, or the Shadow Man and Mohammed Deif's right-hand man, is the deputy commander-in-chief of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.
Israeli forces detained him during the first intifada for five years due to his activity with Hamas.
The Palestinian Authority arrested Issa in 1997, but he was freed after the second intifada in 2000.
He was on Israel's most-wanted list, and was injured when Israel attempted to assassinate him in 2006.
Israeli warplanes also destroyed his house twice during invasions of Gaza in 2014 and 2021, killing his brother.
It was not known what Issa looked like until 2011, when he appeared in a group photo taken during a reception for exchanged prisoners.
He is thought to have played a significant role in planning incursions into Israel, including the most recent.
Khaled Meshaal, who was born in the West Bank in 1956, is considered one of the founders of Hamas.
Under direct instructions from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Mossad spy agency attempted to assassinate Meshaal in 1997 while he was living in Jordan,
Mossad agents entered Jordan with forged Canadian passports and Meshaal was injected with a toxic substance while walking along a street.
Jordanian authorities discovered the assassination attempt and arrested two Mossad members.
The late King Hussein of Jordan asked Israel's PM for the antidote for the substance Meshaal was injected with. Facing pressure from then US President Bill Clinton, Mr Netanyahu provided the antidote after initially rejecting the request.
Meshaal, who lives in Qatar, visited the Gaza Strip for the first time in 2012. He was received by Palestinian officials and crowds of Palestinians came out to welcome him.
Hamas elected Ismail Haniyeh to succeed Meshaal as head of its political bureau in 2017, and Meshaal became head of the group's political bureau abroad.
Mahmoud Zahar was born in Gaza in 1945 to a Palestinian father and an Egyptian mother. He is considered one of Hamas' most prominent leaders, and a member of the movement's political leadership.
He went to school in Gaza and university in Cairo, then worked as a doctor in Gaza and Khan Younis until Israeli authorities dismissed him over his political position.
Mahmoud Zahar was held in Israeli prisons in 1988, months after the founding of Hamas. He was among those deported by Israel to no-man's land in 1992, where he spent a year.
With the Hamas movement winning Palestinian general elections in 2006, Zahar joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh's newly formed government before its eventual dismissal.
Israel attempted to assassinate Zahar in 2003, when a plane dropped a bomb on his house in Gaza City. The attack left him with minor injuries, but killed his eldest son, Khaled.
His second son, Hossam, who was a member of the al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza in 2008.

"'Granny, I've been shot,' said Palestinian student targeted in Vermont",,BBC,By Nadine Yousif,"After being ambushed and shot in the spine on a US street at the weekend, Hisham Awartani called police. Then the Palestinian-American student phoned his British-born grandmother.
""Granny, I've been shot,"" the 20-year-old said, his uncle told the BBC.
Mr Awartani was targeted on Saturday in Burlington, Vermont, along with two fellow Palestinian-American students.
He and the other victims - Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Aliahmad - are expected to survive.
All three are recovering from their injuries in an intensive care unit at hospital.
But for Mr Awartani, who was most critically injured, family members fear he may not walk again. His road to recovery will be long either way, his uncle said.
""The bullet is lodged in his T2 vertebra against his spine,"" Rich Price said.
The uncle said the incident had left him and other relatives of the victims with a sense of shame, as family members had encouraged the young men to pursue university education in the US for stability and safety.
""Never could we have imagined that they would come here to study and something like this could happen to them,"" Mr Price said.
Mr Awartani is in his third year of studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
He and his friends were attacked after attending the birthday party of Mr Price's twin eight-year-old sons at a local bowling alley.
The three 20-year-olds are childhood best friends who attended the Ramallah Friends School, a Quaker-run private non-profit in the West Bank.
They were in Burlington visiting relatives for US Thanksgiving, and were staying with Mr Awartani's grandmother, Marian Price, who is originally from Surbiton, Surrey. They were gunned down round the corner from her home.
""Within five minutes of leaving the house, a man stepped out of the darkness, pulled a gun on them and shot four times,"" said Mr Price.
Two of them were shot in the chest, he said, and a third was shot in the lower part of his body. Mr Awartani was also shot in the hand, his uncle said.
Police have arrested a suspect, 48-year-old Jason Eaton, who lives near Mr Awartani's relatives, in a neighbourhood close to the University of Vermont.
When he opened his front door to find federal agents who were searching for him, he told them he had been expecting them, officials said
Mr Eaton appeared in court on Monday and pleaded not guilty to three counts of second-degree attempted murder. He is being held without bail.
Police have not identified a possible motive, but are investigating whether a hate crime was committed.
Relatives believe the young men were deliberately targeted because of their Palestinian background. They were speaking a mix of English and Arabic at the time they were shot, and two were wearing keffiyehs, traditional Palestinian scarves.
The incident comes as the US deals with a surge in Islamophobia and antisemitism since the start of the Israel-Gaza war.
Mr Price said the attack is especially heart-breaking given the sense of safety the family previously felt in Burlington, a city of around 45,000 people.
""To have something like this happen,"" Mr Price said, ""which in our view is most likely driven by hate, it is devastating for us.""
The uncle said that despite his nephew's serious injury, he had shown strength and even a sense of humour while recovering in intensive care.
""I do know that he is incredibly grateful that so many people are thinking about him,"" he added.
Mr Price said his family had been heartened by the support the three young men have received, not just from the US but across the globe.
At a vigil held in his honour on Monday night at Brown University's campus, a professor read out a statement from Mr Awartani describing himself as ""one casualty in a much wider conflict"", NBC News reported.
But the vigil was disrupted by hundreds of pro-Palestinian students who chanted ""shame on you"" at the university president and demanded the school divest its endowment from companies profiting from the war.
US President Joe Biden has denounced the attack.
""While we are waiting for more facts, we know this: there is absolutely no place for violence or hate in America. Period,"" Mr Biden said in a statement.

"Palestinian militant, 17, killed during Israeli West Bank raid",,BBC,By Tom Bateman,"Israeli forces have shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian militant during a series of overnight detention raids in the occupied West Bank.
Residents said Othman Abu Kharj was killed in the village of Zababdeh, near Jenin, after the army entered, sparking confrontations with locals.
The army did not comment directly on his death, but said ""explosive devices"" were thrown by Palestinians.
Witnesses said troops shot the teenager near a house that had been surrounded.
The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad claimed Abu Kharj as a fighter in their ""rapid response unit"".
The army raids took place in at least 20 locations across the West Bank following the killing of three Israelis in separate attacks by Palestinian gunmen this week.
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, pledged to ""settle the score with the murderers and those who send them, near and far"". He ultimately blamed the killings on Iran, which backs Islamic Jihad and the largest Palestinian militant group, Hamas.
The Palestinian Prisoners Club said more than 50 people were held overnight, accusing Israel of collective punishment and ""vandalism"" of families' homes.
Also during Monday night's raids, a Palestinian man was critically injured after being shot in the head by Israeli forces in a village near Nablus. Video appeared to show him unarmed and running towards an injured person before being hit by a single shot.
The West Bank is in the grip of the worst violence in two decades amid the absence of any political solution to the conflict, while Israel's military occupation is now into its 57th year.
Israel has the most ultranationalist government in its history in which politicians now routinely call for more strident military operations and further Israeli settlement expansion.
Meanwhile, internecine divisions have seen Palestinian political rivalries deepen and its official leadership lose control of key West Bank cities to militant groups.
On Saturday, a Palestinian gunman shot dead two Israelis - a father and son - at a car wash in the northern West Bank town of Hawara, the site of repeated violence by both armed Palestinians and mobs of Israeli settlers this year.
In the south of the West Bank on Monday, Palestinian gunmen fired at least 20 rounds at a car near Hebron, killing an Israeli woman from a nearby settlement, Batsheva Nigri. The male driver was seriously wounded while Ms Nigri's 12-year-old daughter was unharmed.
Last week, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy was left seriously wounded after being shot in the head by Israeli forces in occupied East Jerusalem. Police alleged he had tried to throw a petrol bomb at them during a raid.
The same day video showed an apparently unarmed Palestinian man said to suffer from mental health problems being shot and wounded by Israeli troops during a protest near Israel's separation barrier in Qalqilya. The army said it was investigating.
The violence is adding to a deteriorating political atmosphere and fuelling more aggressive rhetoric.
Following the attacks against Israelis, far-right online chat groups followed by hundreds of Israeli settlers called for ""revenge"" against Palestinians and the ethnic cleansing of the town of Hawara.
Pro-settler National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who leads the ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, appeared to brief against his cabinet colleague, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, implying he was weak on security, while another MP from the party called on Mr Gallant to resign.
Meanwhile, Hamas praised Monday's attack near Hebron, calling it a ""natural response"" to Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and linked it to ""threats"" on the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. The militant group Islamic Jihad said it sent a warning ""that what is coming will be more severe and harsh"".
In July, the army carried out its biggest military assault in years on Jenin refugee camp, in which 12 Palestinians, including militants and children, were killed.
An Israeli soldier also died during the raid, and on Tuesday the army said he was killed by fire from his fellow soldiers ""following an incident of mistaken identification"".
Tuesday's overnight raids saw troops detain two Palestinians suspected of carrying out Monday's attack near Hebron, the army said.
Mr Gallant said: ""The terrorists who brutally murdered Batsheva Nigri will spend the rest of their days in prison. We will employ all means to strengthen our security. We will pursue and find our enemies.""
At least 219 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and 31 Israelis have been killed this year.

Israel Gaza: US death toll after Hamas attack jumps to 22,,BBC,By Chloe Kim,"At least 22 American citizens are confirmed to have died after Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel, the US state department has said.
At least another 17 Americans are missing, the White House confirmed.
It is unclear how many of those may been taken captive by the Palestinian militant group.
The death toll from the attack in Israel has reached 1,200. More than 1,100 people have died in Israeli air strikes on Gaza.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the updated figure on Wednesday, posting on X: ""We join families in Israel, in the US, and around the world mourning the loss of loved ones killed in Hamas's heinous attacks.
""We continue efforts to secure the release of those hostages, and the US remains steadfast and unwavering in our support for Israel,"" he wrote.
White House spokesman John Kirby warned the numbers could rise: ""I think we all need to steel ourselves for the very distinct possibility that these numbers will keep increasing, and that we may in fact, find out that more Americans are part of the hostage pool,"" he said.
Speaking at a roundtable discussion with Jewish leaders on Thursday, President Biden accused Hamas of mounting a ""campaign of pure cruelty"" and said it was among the darkest days for the Jewish community since the Holocaust.
Regarding the ongoing hostage situation, he told the audience that if he shared all the details of efforts to free Americans he ""wouldn't be able to get them home"".
A number of Palestinian-Americans are also reported to be stuck in Gaza, though it is unclear if any of them have been injured in the bombardment.
The US Embassy in Jerusalem said in a security alert on Monday: ""US citizens in Gaza who wish to leave and can do so safely are advised to check the status of the Rafah Crossing into Egypt.""
The state department increased its travel alert warning level on Wednesday, advising Americans to reconsider any plans to visit Israel and the West Bank.
Among the missing Americans is 23-year-old American-Israeli Hersh Golberg-Polin, who was at a music festival in the desert when it was stormed by militants.
His parents told the Jerusalem Post they received two messages from him, reading ""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry"".
""We just want him safe,"" Jonathan Polin, his father, said.
Another US citizen living in Israel, Abbey Onn, told the BBC's partner CBS that five members of her family, including a 12-year-old boy, were taken hostage.
On Saturday, she received a WhatsApp message from her family that Hamas fighters were in their home at Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza.
Judith and Natalie Raanan, a mother and teenage daughter from Chicago, Illinois, were visiting relatives in southern Israel when the attack began.
Judith's ex-husband, Natalie's father, told a local news station the pair had texted him that they were hiding in a safe room, but he had not heard from them since.
A soldier with dual US-Israeli citizenship, Itay Chen, has been reported missing in action since Saturday.
His father, Ruby Chen, told CBS he had sought the state department's help in finding his son, who he said had grown up in New York City.
He added that it is ""a fair assumption"" his son was taken to Gaza.
Mr Kirby said the US wants to get all hostages back with families, particularly the American ones, but the US does not know where the hostages are, whether they are all together or how often they are being moved.
US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the US was in regular contact with the families of the missing.
The identities of all the Americans killed have not yet been officially released, but some family members have been announcing the news online or speaking to local media.
Ilan Troen, a professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, said his daughter Deborah Matias, 50, and her husband, Shlomi, were killed when Hamas fighters attacked their community in southern Israel.
Mr Troen said his daughter died while shielding their son, Roten.
""They made sure to fall on him and thereby saved his life,"" he told CBS. ""Although a bullet actually entered his abdomen, but he was saved.""
Long-time Israel resident Hannah Katsman, a native of Cincinnati, Ohio, wrote on Facebook that her son Hayim Katsman was killed at his kibbutz near the border with Gaza.
Mr Katsman, an academic who specialised in Israel studies, graduated from the University of Washington.

Layla Moran: My relatives have nowhere to go in Gaza after bombing,2023-10-17,BBC,By Ione Wells & Joshua Nevett,"An MP has said members of her extended family have ""nowhere to go"" after their house was bombed in Gaza City.
Liberal Democrat Layla Moran told the BBC her relatives had sought shelter in a church after Israeli warnings of a ground offensive.
She said they do not have food, water and power after fleeing south to avoid to the Israeli assault.
Israel has blocked supplies of food, water, fuel, and electricity since the deadly Hamas attacks.
Ms Moran, who became the UK's first MP of Palestinian descent when she was elected in 2017, issued an emotional plea to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to speak up for civilians.
""I would like to see Rishi Sunak take a more strident stance when it comes to humanitarian aid, in particular when it comes to letting it in,"" said Ms Moran.
""I want to see them stress the importance of international humanitarian law, which very clearly puts innocent civilians first.""
The UK government ""believe it is vital that water supplies are restored"" in Gaza and continued to urge Israel to act within international law, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
Ms Moran said that while she was not in direct contact with her relatives in Gaza, she was receiving information from members of her immediate family in the West Bank.
The MP said: ""They are still there, because what they've said is, first of all, it's three generations. One is very old, and they also said they have nowhere to go.""
She also said she was worried for her family in the West Bank, because ""there is a concern of course that this violence starts to escalate, starts to spread"".
At least 1,400 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attack on 7 October, when gunmen infiltrated communities near the Gaza Strip.
More than 2,700 Palestinians have been killed in numerous air strikes against Gaza by the Israeli military that were launched following the attack.
Hundreds of thousands of people from northern Gaza have moved to southern areas after the Israeli military warned civilians to move there for their own safety.
Israel says northern Gaza is a Hamas stronghold and has warned it will be the target of its assault.
In an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier, TV presenter Richard Madeley asked Ms Moran if ""there was any word on the street"" before Hamas launched its attack on Israel.
Following outrage on social media, a GMB spokesman said Madeley was ""sorry that he upset viewers with his question"" and ""his intention was to understand the mood and atmosphere amongst the civilian population of Gaza immediately before the attacks"".
The statement added: ""He did not mean to imply that she or her family might have had any prior knowledge of the attacks.""
Ms Moran told the BBC she did not think the presenter's question ""came from a place of malice"".
""And what I'm sad about is that it's distracted from these more important messages about putting our collective humanity first, about peace, about what we do next and about finding a solution for the future.""
Ms Moran, the foreign affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said it was important to stress the ""clear distinction"" between Hamas and civilians in Gaza.
""These are innocent civilians paying a price for something they had nothing to do with,"" she said.
""I want the government to not just say they want Israel to adhere to international humanitarian law, but also to keep pressing that point and ask them to do the right thing regardless.""
Ms Moran mentioned her extended family's situation when Mr Sunak gave a statement to the House of Commons on the Israel-Hamas conflict on Monday.
The MP said the bombing of her relatives' home in Gaza meant she shared ""profound emotions of loss and grief"" with the Jewish community.
Mr Sunak expressed his sympathies, and paid tribute to ""the fact that she looks forward to a more positive future - it's an ambition that I share"".
The prime minister said ""we must find a way to move forward, to secure a more stable, peaceful settlement"".

Four Israelis killed by Palestinian gunmen near West Bank settlement,2023-06-21,BBC,By David Gritten,"Four Israelis, including a teenage boy, have been shot dead in an attack near a settlement in the occupied West Bank.
Four others were wounded, one of them seriously, when two Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a restaurant and petrol station outside Eli on Tuesday.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas said the gunmen were its members.
One was shot dead at the scene by an armed civilian, while the second fled in a stolen car and was later killed by Israeli forces in the town of Tubas.
Israel's prime minister said ""all options are open"" in response to what he called the ""shocking and abhorrent terrorist attack"", which followed heightened violence across the West Bank in recent days.
A spokesman for Hamas said the shooting was a response to an Israeli military raid in Jenin on Monday in which seven Palestinians were killed.
Tuesday's shooting took place just to the south of Eli on Highway 60, the main road between the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Nablus.
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that the two gunmen arrived in a car from the village of Urif, about 10km (6 miles) to the north.
They opened fire at a roadside hummus restaurant first, killing three civilians, then shot dead another civilian in the forecourt of the petrol station, he added.
One of the gunmen was shot and killed by an armed civilian, but the other was able to flee the scene in a stolen car.
Adm Hagari said IDF soldiers and officers from the Shin Bet security service later found the vehicle near Tubas, 29km to the north-east, and shot and killed the second gunman.
A paramedic with the Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service, Motty Dahan, said that he and his colleagues saw a ""complex site"" when they arrived at the scene of the attack. He added that there were seven victims suffering from gunshot wounds.
""We performed medical checks and began providing medical treatment, three of the victims were evacuated in MDA MICUs [Mobile Intensive Care Units] to hospital, and unfortunately four of the victims were pronounced dead.""
Those killed were identified by Israeli media as 18-year-old Elisha Antman and 63-year-old Ofer Fairman from Eli; 17-year-old Nachman Mordoff from the Ahiya settler outpost east of Eli; and 21-year-old Harel Masoud from Yad Binyamin, a town in central Israel.
The number of Israelis killed was the highest since an attack by a Palestinian outside a synagogue in occupied East Jerusalem in January, when seven died.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement: ""From the depths of my heart, I send condolences to the families of those who were murdered, may God avenge them, and on behalf of the entire people, I send my best wishes for a swift recovery to the wounded.""
""I would like to remind all those who seek to harm us: All options are open. We will continue to fight terrorism with full force and we will defeat it,"" he added.
A spokesman for Hamas, Hazem Qassem, described the shooting as a ""response to the crimes of the occupation [Israel] in Jenin refugee camp yesterday"".
Seven Palestinians were killed  - including a 15-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl named Sadil Ghassan Turkman, who died of her wounds on Wednesday morning - and more than 90 wounded during a raid into the camp by Israeli forces. Several Israeli soldiers were also wounded during the incursion.
Hours after the shooting in Eli, groups of Israeli settlers attacked several nearby Palestinian towns and villages, throwing rocks and setting fire to vehicles, properties and olive groves.
A Palestinian official in the Nablus region, Ghassan Daghlas, told Wafa news agency that a total of 140 cars were damaged or torched, and that 34 Palestinian civilians were injured by rubber bullets and tear-gas canisters fired by Israeli troops as they tried to defend themselves from the settlers.
Meanwhile, far-right parties in Israel's coalition government put pressure on Mr Netanyahu to launch a major military operation in the northern West Bank to counter the wave of Palestinian attacks.
National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir told reporters in Eli that it was time to ""return to targeted assassinations from the air, to bring down buildings, to erect roadblocks, to expel terrorists, and to finish passing the death penalty for terrorists law"".
Since the start of the year, more than 160 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The figures include militants as well as civilians.
In addition, 27 people on the Israeli side have been killed - including two foreigners and a Palestinian worker - in attacks or apparent attacks by Palestinians. All were civilians except one off-duty serving soldier and a member of the Israeli security forces.

Two Palestinian boys killed during Israeli raid in West Bank,2023-11-29,BBC,By Lucy Williamson & David Gritten,"Four Palestinians, including two children, have been killed by Israeli forces during a raid in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials say.
CCTV videos appeared to show eight-year-old Adam al-Ghoul and Basel Abu al-Wafa, 14, being shot during the same incident in the city of Jenin.
The Israeli military said suspects threw explosive devices at its soldiers and that they responded with live fire.
It also said troops killed ""two high-ranking terrorists"" during the raid.
There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel on 7 October.
Footage shows a small figure on a security camera video turning and starting to run, before falling sharply to the ground. His eight-year-old body is easily dragged from the road by a friend.
The life of Adam al-Ghoul ended in Jenin on Wednesday with a shot to the head, as Israeli forces withdrew from a military operation in the refugee camp there.
Nearby, his 14-year-old friend, Basel Abu al-Wafa was fighting for his life after being shot in the chest, with gunfire hitting the ground around him.
At Jenin Hospital, both boys were declared dead.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that during ""activity in the Jenin camp, a number of suspects hurled explosive devices toward IDF soldiers"".
""The soldiers responded with live fire toward the suspects and hits were identified.""
As Basel's body was prepared for burial in the crowded hospital morgue, a relative watched as the teenager was wrapped in the green flag of Hamas. It wasn't what Basel would have wanted, he told the BBC.
""He's innocent, not from the militias,"" he said, teetering between anger and grief. ""He's perfect in school, a good boy, kind.""
The hospital director, Dr Wissam Bakr, said the boys' wounds - from shots to the head and chest - showed that they were intentionally killed.
""There's no safe place in Jenin now,"" he said.
The war in Gaza has increased tensions here in the West Bank, where there are near-nightly raids by Israel's forces.
In its operations in Jenin overnight, the IDF said it had killed a senior commander for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Mohammed Zubeidi, and another called Wissam Hanoun who had been inside a building with him.
It accused Zubeidi of involvement in two shootings in May in which an Israeli civilian was killed and several soldiers were wounded.
Palestinian Islamic Jihad - which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist group by Israel, the UK and other Western powers - confirmed that two of its local commanders were killed.
The IDF also said it had arrested 17 wanted individuals during the raid.
Israeli missiles, grenades and explosives have left a broad scar of destruction in Jenin's camp - several houses gutted or collapsed, and large chunks of masonry hanging over mounds of rubble.
Diggers were helping search for a body still believed to be buried there.
Militant leaders were the target here, killed along with boys of eight and 14.
Before the Jenin raid, the UN said that at least 225 Palestinians, including more than 50 children, had been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since 7 October.
Adam and Basel are the latest casualties of a conflict that keeps getting older, even as children die.

Landmark Saudi and Israeli trips as normalisation talks progress,2023-09-26,BBC,By Yolande Knell,"A high-level Saudi delegation is in the occupied West Bank for the first time since Israel captured the territory from Jordan in the 1967 war.
Hours after it arrived, Israel's tourism minister landed in Saudi Arabia for a UN event.
Haim Katz became the first Israeli minister to lead an official delegation to the Gulf country, his office said.
The landmark trips come after Saudi and Israeli leaders commented positively on efforts to establish diplomatic ties.
The US has recently been brokering complex negotiations between its two regional allies.
A deal between the powerful states would mark a dramatic shift in Middle Eastern politics and give a major foreign policy victory to US President Joe Biden.
On Tuesday morning, Saudi Arabia's first official envoy to the Palestinians, Nayef al-Sudairi, who is also ambassador to Jordan, drove into the West Bank via the Karama crossing for a two-day visit. Israel controls entry at the border and would have had to have authorised his arrival.
The Palestinian foreign ministry marked what it described as ""a historic milestone"" in relations with Riyadh.
The Saudi diplomat was met with fanfare in Ramallah, where the Palestinian Authority (PA) has its headquarters.
At the presidential compound, he reviewed the guard of honour that had lined up to greet him, while the Palestinian and Saudi national anthems played out.
He then presented his official credentials to the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, at a ceremony.
Speaking to journalists, Mr Sudairi tried to reassure Palestinians about developments. He referred to the rare interview which Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave days ago to Fox News.
Prince Mohammed said ""every day we get closer"" to an agreement on normalisation between his country and Israel, while adding that the Palestinian issue was still a ""very important"" part of the talks.
""The interest of the crown prince in the Palestinian cause is not new. He is keen that the whole region and the world are stable and safe, because this reflects positively on all the people in the world,"" the ambassador said.
The visit of Haim Katz to Riyadh was not previously announced.
He is spending two days in Saudi Arabia attending the UN World Tourism Organization's World Tourism Day event.
""Tourism is a bridge between nations,"" Mr Katz's office quoted him as saying. ""Partnership on tourism issues has the potential to bring hearts together and economic prosperity.""
""I will work to create collaborations to promote tourism and Israel's foreign relations.""
Last week at the UN General Assembly in New York, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was ""at the cusp"" of a deal with Saudi Arabia, which he predicted would transform the Middle East.
However, US officials have cautioned that talks have a long way to go.
If an agreement is reached in the coming months, it is expected to include a defence agreement between Riyadh and Washington and help for a civilian nuclear programme for Saudi Arabia.
Both the US and Saudi Arabia would want to see significant progress made on the Palestinian question amid calls for a renewed peace process leading to the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.
Direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, brokered by the US, have been suspended since 2014.
Recently, tensions between the two sides have worsened amid rising violence, particularly in the West Bank.
President Abbas appeared to refer to the possibility of a Saudi-Israeli normalisation deal in his own speech at the UN General Assembly, saying that no new Middle East peace agreement could be achieved unless Palestinians were given full rights.
When he spoke in New York, the Saudi foreign minister also called for the goal of the two-state solution to be revived.

"Five members of the same family were killed in Gaza air strikes, US relatives say",2023-10-21,BBC,By Nadine Yousif,"A mother-of-four who died with two of her children in an Israeli air strike on Gaza has been described as intelligent and kind by her family in Minnesota.
Heba, 42, was killed when her family home was hit.
An ocean away in Blaine, Minnesota her relatives were glued to social media, hoping to hear news of their safety.
Instead, they were devastated to learn that in total, five relatives were killed.
""Our life has come to a standstill,"" Jehad Adwan told the BBC, adding that he and his wife have been gripped with anxiety and grief since learning of the deaths.
""No-one is spared the trauma and suffering,"" he said.
Several generations had lived in the housing complex that was home to about 30 people in Khan Younis, which is the hometown of his wife, Fatma Abumousa.
Mr Adwan said their home was struck twice last Sunday.
""It was very surreal, to see your hometown is being bombed in front of you, and you're sitting thousands of miles away, and you don't know whether your family is safe,"" he said.
Heba, one of the victims, was Ms Abumousa's sister-in-law. She was an accomplished architect and author, Mr Adwan said. He described her as a ""very highly educated, very kind woman"".
Her 18-year-old son, Hmaid, also died. Mr Adwan said he had just finished high school and was looking to study engineering in Germany, and described him as ""very brilliant"",
Also killed was his younger brother, seven-year-old Abdelrahman, who had just started first grade.
Another nephew of Ms Abumousa's, five-year-old Yusef, was killed. Mr Adwan said he was playing with his cousins when the airstrike hit their home.
Hani, a cousin of Ms Abumousa's in his 40s, was also killed. Mr Adwan said he went to rescue his nephews after the first blast, and was killed by the second.
Heba's two other children, 12-year-old Sham and 16-year-old Abdullah, were both seriously injured with shrapnel wounds to the back and the leg and are in hospital, Mr Adwan said.
Yusef's siblings, two children aged 12 and eight, were also wounded in the blast.
Some of the victims were relatives who lived in north Gaza, Mr Adwan said, but had evacuated south after orders from the Israeli army.
The couple says they have watched on horrified since the war began on 7 October, after Hamas broke out of the Gaza Strip and attacked Israeli civilians in nearby towns.
About 1,400 Israelis were killed in the attacks, officials said. In Gaza, health officials said more than 4,000 people have been killed so far as fighting between Israel and Hamas continues.
Mr Adwan said the situation was made even more difficult by the lack of power in Gaza, which has limited the amount of information the couple is able to get on their loved ones.
Since hearing about the deaths, the couple has been feeling ""a lot of anguish"", he said, as Ms Abumousa was very close to the children that were killed.
Ms Abumousa, who moved to the US three years ago and is a lab technician, worked in a Gaza hospital during the 2014 war.
""It was a very hard time,"" she recalled. ""But I think this time is at least one hundred times harder.""
Israel has said that its mission is to eliminate Hamas in the Gaza Strip, but Mr Adwan said his family members are all innocent civilians who were indiscriminately killed by the Israeli army.
""Hmaid, Abelrahman, Yusef, Heba, Hani and all the other kids that were injured belonged to no political party,"" he said. ""Their only guilt is that they are Palestinian civilians.""
Mr Adwan said he does not see a quick resolution to this conflict.
""What I really hope for is for the Palestinians to be recognised as a people, as human beings who deserve and demand freedom, who deserve to be treated equally like any other human beings on earth,"" he said.
He has also criticised attempts by the US government to block a UN resolution for a ceasefire.
The US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on Wednesday that would have called for humanitarian pauses in the conflict to allow humanitarian aid access to the Gaza Strip.
The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the US wanted to let its own diplomatic efforts ""play out"".
""There has to be a resolution for this, otherwise the cycle of violence will keep coming back,"" said Mr Adwan.

Thousands attend march against antisemitism in London,2023-11-26,BBC,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67538559
Israel Gaza: US in diplomatic dash to contain conflict,2023-10-16,BBC,By Barbara Plett Usher,"President Joe Biden's decision to visit Israel caps a week of intense US diplomacy aimed at shoring up its closest Middle East ally and trying to prevent Israel's war with Hamas from spreading to the region.
The Americans are worried that the audacity of the Hamas attack and the ferocity of the Israeli counter-offensive could spark violence in the West Bank and beyond.
The president will be joining his Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who's been on a frantic swing through the Middle East. Mr Blinken has stressed full US support for a forceful response to the deadly Hamas raid, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.
But he is also trying to mitigate the civilian casualties in Gaza, the enclave that is governed by the Palestinian militant group. Israel has already killed nearly 3,000 Palestinians in relentless airstrikes, and blocked food, water and electricity to Gaza, plunging it into a humanitarian crisis.
""Blinken is trying to thread the needle,"" says David Schenker, the state department's former top diplomat for the Middle East. ""So far, he seems to have managed it relatively well. But it becomes more and more challenging.""
Mr Blinken's emphasis on protecting civilians grew during his whirlwind tour of America's Arab allies at the end of last week, visiting six countries in three days.
He wanted them to clearly condemn Hamas for the unprecedented scale and brutality of the attack, and hoped to limit criticism of Israel's military campaign.
Only two Arab governments - Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates - denounced Hamas. Others may have done so privately, because most are hostile to Hamas in varying degrees.
In public, though, they focused on the humanitarian tragedy already unfolding in Gaza.
A lengthy Israeli ground operation could inflame their populations, who support the Palestinian cause, threatening stability in their countries and narrowing the diplomatic room that Arab heavyweights such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia have to calm the situation.
Egypt was the most outspoken. Its President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi told Mr Blinken that Israel's military operations had already exceeded ""the right of self-defence"" and turned into collective punishment.
In this environment, some analysts questioned whether Mr Biden's trip to show solidarity with Israel could be seen as provocative. Others suggested it might help to underline a private message of restraint, should the president choose to deliver one.
""He's a very visceral politician,"" says Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. ""It may be that he feels that if you're going to push the Israelis, you can't push them until you've already made clear that you care.""
Mr Biden will also be meeting the Egyptian leader along with Jordan's King Abdullah and the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman to discuss humanitarian issues.
This follows the administration's announcement that the US and Israel have agreed to try to find ways to get humanitarian aid into Gaza and set up ""safe zones"" for civilians.
The initiative came after the secretary of state reported back to Washington the concerns of Arab leaders, says a senior state department official. The president instructed him to draw up a plan with the Israelis.
Where Mr Biden will not push the Israelis is on their assessment of Hamas.
US officials have adopted Israeli language that compares the Palestinian movement to the Islamic State group, saying it was an attack of ""sheer evil"" unrelated to legitimate frustrations about decades of Israeli occupation and the grinding misery of its 16-year blockade of Gaza.
Khaled Elgindy, the director of Israeli-Palestinian Affairs at the Middle East Institute, says this ignores a chorus of warnings in the year leading up to the unprecedented incursion about an impending ""explosion"" in the Palestinian territories.
He describes US policy as ""strategic neglect"".
""They've been committed to keeping the issue low down on the list of priorities,"" he says. ""I think that's one of the reasons we are where we are, is this neglect and allowing these wounds to fester. ""The status quo was comfortable for Israel and for the United States. But it was certainly not comfortable for Palestinians.""
The Biden administration has focused its Middle East policy on integrating Israel into the region through a normalisation agreement with Saudi Arabia, which it argues is crucial for stability, while trying to pivot its attention more to China and Russia's war with Ukraine.
Now, though, it fears a regional conflict that could force it to plunge back into the Middle East.
The US is particularly concerned that Iran will capitalise on the situation through armed groups it supports, like Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement. Low-level clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon intensified at the weekend, as Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian conducted his own tour of allies in the region.
That included a meeting with the Hamas representative in Qatar, where they discussed how to prevent Israel's expected further assault on Gaza, according to Iran's state news agency.
Still, so far Iran has shown relative restraint.
""They're playing the long game,"" says Mr Alterman, ""and I'm not sure that this is the moment when they want to go all in.""
That could change depending on how Israel's ground operation in Gaza unfolds. The Pentagon has now sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean as a clear warning.
Deterrence is a big part of the administration's ""rock solid"" show of support for Israel, says Mr Schenker, noting that the extraordinary damage Hamas inflicted on Israel made America's key partner in the Middle East look weak.
""If we don't stand by Israel, we are further raising questions about our commitment to our regional allies,"" he says. ""Already for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, this US commitment to their security was in question.""
There's no question the US will stand by Israel. The question is at what cost, and how that will affect its ability to shape the new strategic realities to come.

Israel and Gaza militants in heaviest fighting for months,2023-05-10,BBC,By Raffi Berg and David Gritten,"Israel says Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired more than 460 rockets at it, and that its military has hit over 130 militant targets in Gaza, in the heaviest fighting in nine months.
Six people were killed and 45 injured in Gaza, local medics say.
Several were hurt rushing to shelters in Israel, where most rockets have been intercepted or fell in open areas.
It comes a day after 15 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, including three Islamic Jihad leaders.
The Islamic Jihad (PIJ), which is the second biggest militant group in the territory after Hamas, had sworn to avenge their deaths.
In a televised address on Wednesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel's ""campaign is not over"".
""We have hit Islamic Jihad with the most significant blow it has ever suffered,"" he said, referring to the simultaneous killings of the three PIJ commanders in the early hours of Tuesday.
Hours before Mr Netanyahu spoke, Egyptian media reported that Egypt had brokered a ceasefire, but there was no immediate confirmation from the two sides. Soon afterwards, another rocket barrage was fired towards southern Israel and there were further strikes in Gaza.
An umbrella organisation representing armed factions in Gaza earlier warned that ""if Israel increases its aggression, dark days await it"".
Palestinians said the exchange of fire began on Wednesday morning with several loud explosions in southern Gaza, sending up large plumes of smoke.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said an aircraft targeted PIJ operatives travelling in a vehicle to a concealed rocket launcher in the Khan Younis area.
About an hour later, the IDF announced that it had started attacking underground rocket launchers belonging to PIJ across the territory in order to thwart planned attacks.
Palestinian media reported strikes in and around Gaza City, in the southern town of Rafah, and in the northern towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun.
The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza reported that six people were killed in Israeli strikes.Four of them were members of the military wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the group said, adding that two died in Khan Younis and the other two in Rafah.A 10-year-old girl was also killed in Gaza City in unclear circumstances.
As Israeli aircraft struck Gaza, militants began firing barrages of rockets from Gaza and rocket sirens sounded in communities in southern Israel.
Later, rockets were launched towards central Israel, triggering sirens in the Tel Aviv area, 80km (50 miles) from Gaza. In one video filmed in Old Jaffa, explosions could be heard as two rockets appeared to be intercepted overhead.
The Israeli military said four houses suffered direct hits - two in Sderot, which is only 1km (0.6 miles) from Gaza, and two in Ashkelon, 7km from Gaza. Another hit the roof of a kindergarten in Nirim, on the edge of Gaza to the south, and a yeshiva (religious school) in Netivot, 11km east of Gaza. There were no injuries directly from rocket fire.
The IDF said one in four rockets fired at it had fallen short and landed inside Gaza. It said Israel's Iron Dome air defence system had intercepted 153 rockets, three had hit urban areas in Israel and the rest landed in open areas.
The Joint Operations Room of armed groups in Gaza, which includes Islamic Jihad and Hamas, claimed in a statement that they had launched the rockets.
""The damage to the homes of civilians and faction fighters is a red line, and we will respond strongly to it. Resistance forces are ready for all options,"" it said.
The IDF launched Operation Shield and Arrow in the early hours of Tuesday with several waves of strikes across Gaza that killed 13 Palestinians.
Three were PIJ commanders who the IDF said were involved in recent attacks against Israeli civilians and were planning more.  But the other 10 dead were civilians, including four women and four children.
Another two Palestinians were killed on Tuesday afternoon in a strike that the IDF said targeted militants planning to fire anti-tank missiles.
The strikes were the deadliest since three days of hostilities between Israel and PIJ last August, in which 49 Palestinians were killed in Gaza.
PIJ has been responsible for many of the rocket attacks on Israel in recent years and is sworn to Israel's destruction.
There was a serious flare-up last week, as PIJ and other groups fired more than 100 rockets into Israel over two days, following the death in an Israeli prison of a Palestinian hunger striker. The Israeli military carried out air strikes on sites it said were linked to Hamas in response.
Tensions also remained high in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, after Israel carried out arrest raids overnight.
Two Palestinians were killed in the town of Qabatiya by Israeli forces, who said the pair fired at them. The IDF also said a soldier was also seriously wounded during a separate exchange of fire with Palestinian gunmen in Tubas.

Surgeon who left Gaza urges UK government to do more,,BBC,,"A surgeon who escaped from the war in Gaza has said the UK government should do more to get British nationals out.
Abdelkadar Hammad, who works at Royal Liverpool Hospital, is among 100 UK citizens who have left since Thursday.
However, he believes they could have got out of Gaza in the week after war began if there had been ""concerted pressure from our government"".
Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said the UK was trying to ensure people could leave ""as rapidly as possible"".
Dr Hammad said he was ""very happy"" to have been able to leave the war-torn region but he was also ""sad about the continuing loss of life in Gaza, especially children"".
""I would like to see more efforts to stop all this bloodshed, really, in Gaza.""
What is the Rafah crossing?
Dr Hammad, who has visited Gaza regularly over the past decade to provide medical support, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I think that the British government and probably all western governments have to make effort and put pressure on the parties there to get the people out.
""I thought we could have been out in the first week of the conflict if there was a concerted pressure from our government to get us out, and they should not have left us with our lives at risk there.""
The surgeon arrived in Gaza on 6 October to perform four kidney transplant operations and had been scheduled to leave three days later.
However, he had to seek shelter when war broke out following the Hamas attacks in Israel, in which 1,400 people were killed and about 240 hostages taken.
Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,700 people have been killed in the Strip amid the Israeli bombardment.
""I can't stop thinking about my colleagues who I left there and the patients I usually treat in Gaza,"" Dr Hammad said.
""I think many of them [kidney patients] will die due to lack of treatment during this period and obviously those people will not be accounted for as victims of the war.
""But the conditions there - especially the medical situation there, which is disastrous - will cause a lot of deaths in this group of patients.""
Dr Hammad said many people in Gaza were living ""without sanitation, water and food"".
""People are fighting for bread, for flour… if this continues for any time longer, then I think there will be a breakout of diseases.""
His son Salim said it had been a ""stressful four weeks"" for their family.
""Seeing him come out of the airport was just such a relief and it was bittersweet as well, knowing that he was able to come out, because we're lucky to have British passports and to be from England.
""But there are people who were not able to leave and it was bittersweet to think about everything that he's left behind there.""
There were thought to be about 200 British nationals in Gaza before war broke out, with more than 100 having got out in the past few days.
Mr Dowden told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: ""The first thing we are doing is trying to make sure we get the Rafah crossing open again and I'm hopeful we will make progress on that today.
""Secondly, we are seeking to have these temporary pauses to allow humanitarian aid in and to get our people out.""

"British couple trapped in Gaza with no UK help, says son",,BBC,By Nora Fakim & James W Kelly,"A British-Palestinian couple trapped in Gaza amid Israel's siege have had little help from the UK government, their son has said.
Naila and Talal El-Deeb, from London, were visiting relatives in Gaza when the violence erupted onSaturday with Hamas's attack on Israel.
Mo El-Deeb said his parents' attempt to flee through Egypt was halted when an Israeli jet struck near the border.
The UK government said it was working to keep the Rafah border open.
Mo, from Marylebone in central London, told BBC News both his parents were originally from Gaza and his dad went back to visit family a couple of months ago, with Mrs El-Deeb joining him two weeks ago.
The 30-year-old said: ""Now they're stuck. There's no way for them to get out - we've tried every angle and there's no real solution for them to leave Gaza.""
Mrs El-Deeb has suffered a stroke since arriving in the territory, her son said.
""They were instructed to go to the Egyptian border as their names were on some sort of list,"" Mo said. ""When they got to the border there was about 5,000 people waiting in a queue.
""Within five minutes of them being there, there had been a strike on a building opposite the border.""
They were then evacuated and told the border would be closed for the ""foreseeable future"", Mo said.
He added that since then his parents had ""been sheltering in the dark with no electricity"".
He said the British Embassy told them to follow the advice published on the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office's (FCDO) website.
The current advice states: ""If you are a British national in Gaza and want to leave, check the status of the Rafah crossing into Egypt before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk.""
British citizens are also encouraged to register with the FCDO.
On Thursday, the government announcedevacuation flights for British nationals stranded in Israel, but those in Gaza are unable to cross the Israel border.
""I got sent a voice note this morning (Thursday) and you could hear bombs in the background,"" Mo told the BBC.
""My parents are waiting to hear instructions from the Foreign Office [but] nobody seems to know.""
Another Londoner worried about family in Gaza is Saleem Lubbad, a Palestinian academic who has lived in the capital for over 10 years.
He told the BBC his family was under constant threat fromIsraeli airstrikes.
""The whole place is being carpet-bombed,"" the 33-year-old said. ""We lost close family members - three cousins and an uncle. From my mother's side we lost 14 people, an entire family was wiped out.""
He said members of his family, including his two brothers with their children, had been displaced multiple times due to the bombing from Israeli military jets.
""There's literally nowhere to go,"" he added.
""I am desperately anxious over the fate of my siblings,"" Mr Lubbad told the BBC. ""At any minute we expect to learn that one, if not all of them, have been killed.""
A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""The safety of all British nationals continues to be our utmost priority.
""The UK Government has facilitated commercial flights to help British nationals wanting to leave Israel following the Hamas attacks.
""We are working with our international partners on the challenging security situation at the Rafah border crossing to keep the route open.""

"Israel Gaza: Hamas raped and mutilated women on 7 October, BBC hears",,BBC,By Lucy Williamson,"The BBC has seen and heard evidence of rape, sexual violence and mutilation of women during the 7 October Hamas attacks.
WARNING: CONTAINS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND RAPE
Several people involved in collecting and identifying the bodies of those killed in the attack told us they had seen multiple signs of sexual assault, including broken pelvises, bruises, cuts and tears, and that the victims ranged from children and teenagers to pensioners.
Video testimony of an eyewitness at the Nova music festival, shown to journalists by Israeli police, detailed the gang rape, mutilation and execution of one victim.
Videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers.
Few victims are thought to have survived to tell their own stories.
Their last moments are being pieced together from survivors, body-collectors, morgue staff and footage from the attack sites.
Police have privately shown journalists a single horrific testimony that they filmed of a woman who was at the Nova festival site during the attack.
She describes seeing Hamas fighters gang rape a woman and mutilate her, before the last of her attackers shot her in the head as he continued to rape her.
In the video, the woman known as Witness S mimes the attackers picking up and passing the victim from one to another.
""She was alive,"" the witness says. ""She was bleeding from her back.""
She goes on to detail how the men cut off parts of the victim's body during the assault.
""They sliced her breast and threw it on the street,"" she says. ""They were playing with it.""
The victim was passed to another man in uniform, she continues.
""He penetrated her, and shot her in the head before he finished. He didn't even pick up his pants; he shoots and ejaculates.""
One man we spoke to from the festival site said he heard the ""noises and screams of people being murdered, raped, decapitated"".
To our question about how he could be sure - without seeing it - that the screams he heard indicated sexual assault rather than other kinds of violence, he said he believed while listening at the time that it could only have been rape.
A statement he made through a support organisation describes it as ""inhuman"".
""Some women were raped before they were dead, some raped while injured, and some were already dead when the terrorists raped their lifeless bodies,"" his statement says. ""I desperately wanted to help, but there was nothing I could do.""
Police say they have ""multiple"" eye-witness accounts of sexual assault, but wouldn't give any more clarification on how many.  When we spoke to them, they hadn't yet interviewed any surviving victims.
Hamas has rejected Israel's accusation that its men sexually assaulted women during the attacks.
Israel's Women's Empowerment Minister, May Golan, told the BBC that a few victims of rape or sexual assault had survived the attacks, and that they were all currently receiving psychiatric treatment.
""But very, very few. The majority were brutally murdered,"" she said. ""They aren't able to talk - not with me, and not to anyone from the government [or] from the media.""
Videos filmed by Hamas include footage of one woman, handcuffed and taken hostage with cuts to her arms and a large patch of blood staining the seat of her trousers.
In others, women carried away by the fighters appear to be naked or semi-clothed.
Multiple photographs from the sites after the attack show the bodies of women naked from the waist down, or with their underwear ripped to one side, legs splayed, with signs of trauma to their genitals and legs.
""It really feels like Hamas learned how to weaponise women's bodies from ISIS [the Islamic State group] in Iraq, from cases in Bosnia,"" said Dr Cochav Elkayam-Levy, a legal expert at the Davis Institute of International Relations at Hebrew University.
""It brings me chills just to know the details that they knew about what to do to women: cut their organs, mutilate their genitals, rape. It's horrifying to know this.""
""I spoke with at least three girls who are now hospitalised for a very hard psychiatric situation because of the rapes they watched,"" Minister May Golan told me. ""They pretended to be dead and they watched it, and heard everything.  And they can't deal with it.""
Israel's police chief Yaacov Shabtai said that many survivors of the attacks were finding it difficult to talk and that he thought some of them would never testify about what they saw or experienced.
""Eighteen young men and women have been hospitalised in mental health hospitals because they could no longer function,"" he said.
Others are reportedly suicidal. One of those working with the teams around survivors told the BBC that some had already killed themselves.
Much of the evidence has come from the volunteer body-collectors deployed after the attacks, and those who handled the bodies once they arrived at the Shura army base for identification.
One of the body-collectors volunteering with the religious organisation Zaka described to me signs of torture and mutilation which included, he said, a pregnant woman whose womb had been ripped open before she was killed, and her foetus stabbed while it was inside her.
The BBC has not been able to independently verify this account, and Israeli media reports have questioned some testimony from volunteers working in the traumatic aftermath of the Hamas attacks.
Another, Nachman Dyksztejna, provided written testimony of seeing the bodies of two women in kibbutz Be'eri with their hands and legs tied to a bed.
""One was sexually terrorised with a knife stuck in her vagina and all her internal organs removed,"" his statement says.
At the festival site, he says small shelters were ""filled with piles of women. Their clothing was torn on the upper part, but their bottoms were completely naked. Piles and piles of women. […] When you took a closer look at their heads, you saw a single shot straight to the brain of each.""
Hundreds of bodies were collected from the attack sites by volunteers.
Investigators admit that in those first chaotic days after the attacks, with some areas still active combat zones, opportunities to carefully document the crime scenes, or take forensic evidence, were limited or missed.
""For the first five days, we still had terrorists on the ground in Israel,"" May Golan said. ""And there were hundreds, hundreds of bodies everywhere. They were burned, they were without organs, they were butchered completely.""
""This was a mass casualty event,"" police spokesman Dean Elsdunne told journalists at a briefing.
""The first thing was to work on identifying the victims, not necessarily on crime scene investigation. People were waiting to hear what happened to their loved ones.""
It was staff at the army's Shura base, where bodies arrived for identification, who have provided investigators with some of the most crucial evidence.
This evidence emerged from a makeshift hub of tents and refrigerated shipping containers set up at the base to identify the bodies.
When we visited, hospital trolleys, their iron skeletons topped with khaki stretchers, stood neatly lined up in front of the containers that housed the dead; the white plastic overalls of those on shift translucent under the floodlights.
Fighter jets roared overhead, drowning out the cicadas, as Israel's bombardment of Gaza continued.
Teams here told us they'd seen clear evidence of rape and sexual violence on the bodies coming in, including broken pelvises from sustained violent abuse.
""We see women of all ages,"" one of the reservists on the forensic team, Captain Maayan, told the BBC. ""We see rape victims. We see women who have been through violation. We have pathologists and we see the bruises, we learn about the cuts and tears, and we know they have been sexually abused.""
I ask her what proportion of the bodies she's handled show signs of this.
""Abundant,"" she said. ""Abundant amount of women and girls of all ages.""
The number of victims is hard to define, partly because of the state of the bodies.
""It's definitely multiple,"" said another serving soldier who asked us to use only her first name, Avigayil. ""It's hard to tell. I've dealt with more than a few burned bodies and I have no idea what they went through beforehand. And bodies that are missing the bottom half - I also don't know if they were raped. But women that were clearly raped? There are enough. More than enough.""
""Sometimes we are left only with a very small part of the body,"" Dr Elkayam-Levy tells me. ""Maybe it's a finger, a foot or a hand that they're trying to identify. People were burned to ashes. Nothing was left. […] I want to say that we'll never know how many cases there were.""
Privately some of those working on this talk in terms of ""dozens"" of victims but quickly caution that evidence is still being gathered and pieced together.
The civil commission headed by Dr Elkayam-Levy, to collect testimony on sexual crimes, is calling for international recognition that what happened on 7 October was systematic abuse, constituting Crimes Against Humanity.
""We see definite patterns,"" she told me. ""So it wasn't incidental, it wasn't random. They came with a clear order. It was […] rape as genocide.""
Avigayil agrees there were similarities in the violence visited on the bodies that arrived at the Shura base.
""There are patterns in that groups of women from the same place were treated in a similar manner,"" she said.
""There might be a set of women who were raped in one way, and we're seeing similarities in the bodies; and then a different set that were not raped but shot multiple times in the exact same pattern. So it seems that different groups of terrorists had different forms of cruelty.""
""This was a premeditative, systematic event,"" police chief Yaacov Shabtai told journalists.
David Katz from Israel's cyber crime unit which is involved in the investigation, told journalists that it was too early to prove that sexual violence was planned as part of the attack, but that data extracted from the phones of the Hamas attackers suggested that ""everything was systematic"".
""It would be reckless to say we can already prove it […] but everything that was done there was done systematically,"" he said. ""Nothing happened by coincidence. Rape was systematic.""
Israel's government points to documents it says were found on Hamas fighters that appear to support the idea that sexual violence was planned. It's released clips of interrogations with some captured fighters in which they appear to say that women were targeted for this purpose.
Last week, UN Women put out a statement saying it ""unequivocally condemn[ed] the brutal attacks by Hamas"" and was ""alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks"".
Dr Elkayam-Levy said before the statement that international women's rights organisations had taken far too long to respond to her call for support.
""This is the most documented atrocity humanity has known,"" she told me.
""Israel on 7 October is not the same country that woke up the following morning,"" said police chief Yaacov Shabtai.
Amid the horror of what happened to women here, Captain Maayan from the Shura identification unit says the hardest moments are when she sees ""the mascara on their eyelashes, or the earrings they put on that morning"".
I ask where that lands in her, as a woman.
""Terror,"" she replied. ""It terrorises us.""

Three Israelis killed by Palestinian gunmen at Jerusalem bus stop,2023-11-30,BBC,By David Gritten,"Three Israelis were killed and 16 injured after two Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a crowded bus stop in West Jerusalem, Israeli police say.
Video showed the attackers getting out of a car on a highway and shooting at people with a rifle and a pistol.
Off-duty soldiers and a civilian at the scene killed the gunmen, who police said were from occupied East Jerusalem.
Hamas claimed the pair as its members and said the attack was a response to Israeli ""crimes"" in Gaza and elsewhere.
Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza after an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen almost eight weeks ago, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.
A deal mediated by Qatar has led to a pause in the fighting in Gaza since last Friday.
The Jerusalem attack came hours after the Palestinian armed group - which Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - agreed with Israel to extend a truce in Gaza for a seventh day, and to allow another exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
Eight hostages were released from Gaza on Thursday. Two women -Mia Schem and Amit Soussana- were initially released, followed by a group of six others.
Qatar - a key mediator in the deal - said two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday had been included in the following day's tally, meaning the expected number of 10 was reached.
It reiterated that a further 30 Palestinians were due to be released from Israeli jails in return.
Talks have continued in an effort to further prolong the pause in the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on his third trip to the Middle East since fighting broke out with Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October.
In a press conference in Tel Aviv on Thursday evening, Mr Blinken called on Israel to put in place ""safe"" zones for Palestinian civilians in central and southern Gaza before resuming any military operations.
The point, he said, was to ""minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians"".
Mr Blinken earlier commented on the attack in West Jerusalem, calling it a reminder ""of the threat from terrorism that Israel and Israelis face every single day"".
Israeli President Isaac Herzog told his American visitor that the incident was another example of an ""endless war"" Israel was fighting in ""very complicated and challenging times"".
In their account of the attack, Israeli police said they received reports of gunfire at Givat Shaul junction, on the main highway from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, at about 07:40 on Thursday (05:40 GMT).
""A car approached with two armed terrorists - one with an M16 rifle and the other with a handgun,"" Jerusalem District Commander Doron Turgeman told reporters at the scene.
""At a bus stop they opened fire at people who were waiting there,"" he said. ""The quick response of two soldiers and a civilian, who were close to the stop, neutralised the attackers.""
A large amount of ammunition was later found by officers who searched the gunmen's vehicle.
Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service paramedic Moshe Hemed rushed to the scene.
""I saw a number of casualties... Some were lying and some were walking. Along with large numbers of MDA teams we assessed and treated them,"" he said.
""Unfortunately, we had to pronounce a 24-year-old female deceased, and evacuated a further eight casualties in varying conditions to hospitals across the city.""
Later, police announced that two other victims of the attack had died and that three more were in a serious condition in hospital.
Israel media identified the 24-year-old woman as Livia Dickman, and the two others killed as Rabbi Elimelech Wasserman, 73, and Hana Ifergan, 67.
Police said the attackers were two brothers in their 30s from the Sur Baher area of East Jerusalem.
The Shin Bet security service named them as Murad and Ibrahim Namer, and said they were affiliated to Hamas and had previously served prison sentences for involvement in terrorist activities - according to Israeli media.
Visiting the site of the attack, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said: ""Hamas is speaking with two voices here.
""This event proves again how we must not show weakness, that we must speak to Hamas only through the [rifle] scopes, only through the war.""
Mr Ben-Gvir also said the Israeli government would continue to ease regulations for issuing gun licences to citizens.
Hamas later confirmed that two members of its military wing had carried out the attack, calling it a ""natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the (Israeli) occupation"".
It cited the killing of Palestinians in the Gaza war and during Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank, as well as the treatment of Palestinian prisoners.
During Qatar-mediated truce,Hamas has freed dozens of Israeli women and children among its hostages, while Israel has released 210 Palestinian women and youths from its jails.
Twenty-three Thai hostages and one Filipino have also been released as part of a separate deal between Hamas and the Egyptian government.
Before the truce, four Israeli hostages had been released - and Israeli forces in Gaza had rescued one hostage and recovered the bodies of two others.

Met Police urges pro-Palestinian march organisers to delay demo,2023-11-06,BBC,By Sean Seddon,"The Metropolitan Police has urged the organisers of pro-Palestinian demonstrations to postpone events due to take place on Armistice weekend.
Thousands are expected to take part in a march in London on 11 November, the same day some Remembrance events are planned in the capital.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman welcomed the Met's statement, which warned of potential disorder.
Organisers criticised the force and refused to cancel the march.
The Met warned of a ""growing"" risk of violence and disorder fuelled by breakaway groups linked to the protests.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said: ""This is of concern ahead of a significant and busy weekend in the capital.
""Our message to organisers is clear: Please, we ask you to urgently reconsider. It is not appropriate to hold any protests in London this weekend.""
A statement from the Met said it had spoken with organisers on Monday from several groups, and that they had ""declined to postpone"" any demonstrations - but this account was disputed by organisers.
They said it was ""categorically untrue that the police told us that it was not appropriate"" to go ahead with the march, adding that they are ""deeply concerned"" by the statement.
Organisers confirmed they won't postpone the march, and accused the government and ""right wing political groups"" of putting pressure on the police to intervene.
The route of the pro-Palestinian march on Saturday runs from Hyde Park to the US Embassy in south London. It does not pass through Whitehall.
No large demonstration is planned for Remembrance Sunday.
Organisers have previously pointed out the Saturday march is due to begin almost two hours after the national two minutes' silence of commemoration.
In the statement released on Monday night, signed by six organising groups including the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, they added: ""The idea that it is acceptable for Israel to keep bombing and killing Palestinians in Gaza including over 4,000 children, but not for people to protest peacefully against these crimes is grotesque.""
The Met has so far stopped short of invoking a public order law whereby it can ask the Home Secretary Suella Braverman to ban a demonstration from taking place.
Responding to the Met's statement, Ms Braverman said: ""I welcome this statement from the Met Police. The hate marchers need to understand that decent British people have had enough of these displays of thuggish intimidation and extremism.""
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday: ""To plan protests on Armistice Day is provocative and disrespectful, and there is a clear and present risk that the Cenotaph and other war memorials could be desecrated, something that would be an affront to the British public and the values we stand for.""
He added that the police had the government's ""full support in making robust use of all your powers to protect Remembrance activity"", in a letter to Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley.
Ms Braverman has previously described pro-Palestinian protests as ""hate marches"".
Civil liberties group Liberty said police ""should not be able to pick and choose what people can speak out about on any given day"", adding ""shutting down"" protests would be a ""wildly disproportionate response"".
Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the planned march as ""atrocious"". He told TalkTV: ""I call upon all decent human beings to object to the march and ban it, because the symbol of that day is a symbol of victory.""

UK to deploy Royal Navy ships to Middle East to 'bolster security',2023-10-13,BBC,By Aoife Walsh,"The UK will send two Royal Navy ships and surveillance aircraft to the eastern Mediterranean in plans to ""bolster security"", No 10 says.
It comes after six days of violence following the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas.
The aircraft will begin patrols on Friday to ""track threats to regional stability such as the transfer of weapons to terrorist groups"".
Three Merlin helicopters and Royal Marines are also being dispatched.
The government is alsoarranging flightsfor British nationals stranded in Israel. The first plane was expected to leave Tel Aviv on Thursday, but as of Friday morning it had not yet left.
A Foreign Office spokesperson said the situation around departure was ""fluid"", and it was ""currently working to ensure the flight can proceed as soon as possible"".
Speaking in Sweden on Friday, Rishi Sunak said the UK was monitoring the situation in Israel closely, adding ""humanitarian concerns and protection of civilians are very important"".
The prime minister said Royal Navy assets were being moved to the Mediterranean over the coming week  so they can ""provide humanitarian support as required"".
On Thursday he spoke to Israel's prime minister to reaffirm the UK's support for Israel following Hamas' appalling terrorist attack"", Downing Street said.
Defence Secretary Grant Shapps earlier said the Royal Navy vessels were not warships, but ""ships that can assist with hospital facilities"".
He told BBC Breakfast sending the boats was also about ""deterring others from getting involved in the region"" and ""maligning external influence"".
When asked about Israel's response to the attacks, the defence secretary said ""Israel has the right to defend itself"" and added that, ""unlike Hamas"", it was giving warning ""that it's coming after Hamas terrorists"" which was the right thing to do.
Mr Sunak also spoke to Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi on Thursday morning to discuss the importance of opening the Rafah crossing into Gaza to allow for humanitarian access and provide a route for British and other nationals to leave.
Speaking on Thursday, he said the UK's military and diplomatic teams across the region would support international partners to ""re-establish security and ensure humanitarian aid reaches the thousands of innocent victims of this barbaric attack from Hamas terrorists"".
Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on Saturday, killing at least 1,300 and taking around 150 hostages to Gaza.
More than 1,300 have also been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes.

Egypt opens Gaza border crossing to evacuate injured and foreign nationals,2023-11-02,BBC,By David Gritten,"Ambulances took 76 seriously injured Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt on Wednesday for the first time since the war between Hamas and Israel began.
A group of 335 foreign passport holders - including British nationals - were also allowed to leave via the Rafah crossing, officials said.
Gaza's borders have been closed since Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October.
Rafah is expected to continue opening for limited time periods to let foreign nationals and injured civilians leave.
The lists of those allowed to cross will be agreed between Egypt and Israel, with embassies from the relevant countries being informed in advance to ensure they can prepare to receive their citizens, Western officials say.
The BBC understands there are about 7,000 dual nationals in Gaza.
Speaking on Wednesday evening, US President Joe Biden said that thanks to ""concerted American leadership, safe passage for wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals has started"".
American citizens were able to exit, he said, as part of the first group of ""probably more than 1,000"", adding that the process would continue over ""the coming days"".
""We're working non-stop to get Americans out of Gaza as soon and as safely as possible,"" Mr Biden stressed.
UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly earlier said the departure of the first of the estimated 200 Britons in the territory was ""a hugely important first step"".
""We are working with Egyptian and Israeli authorities to ensure the crossing stays open so all British nationals can get to safety in the coming days,""he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Israel has been bombarding Gaza for more than three weeks and has recently sent in ground forces in response to an unprecedented cross-border assault by Hamas gunmen in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 taken hostage.
Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,700 people have been killed in the territory since then, while the UN says supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.
Ambulances were seen rushing to Rafah on Wednesday morning. At least two children were among the wounded - one with a bandaged stomach. After medical checks, they were carried away on stretchers.
At least 76 had arrived in Egypt by the evening, according to a spokesperson for the Palestinian border authority and an Egyptian official.
""Hospitals in the Gaza Strip are treating large numbers of injured people while suffering from a lack of medical supplies. Therefore [they] cannot operate on such cases,"" Nassem Hasan, a medic working with Gaza's health ministry, told Reuters news agency.
""Now they are being transported to the Egyptian side, and will then be evaluated and might be relocated to another hospital.""
Most of the patients will be taken to a field hospital built by Egyptian authorities in Sheikh Zuweid, 15km (9 miles) from Rafah. Others will go to permanent hospitals in the nearby town of El-Arish or the city of Ismailia.
The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,welcomed Egypt's decision to accept medical evacuations.
But he warned: ""Attention must not be diverted from the far greater needs of thousands of patients in Gaza, many of them extremely fragile who cannot be moved.
""We need an immediate acceleration in the flow of medical aid permitted into Gaza. Hospitals must be protected from bombardment and military use.""
The WHO says more than a third of Gaza's hospitals are not functioning, while the rest are only partly working and are overwhelmed by casualties.
Gaza's health ministry says more than 20,000 people have been injured.
The Palestinian border authority said 335 foreign and dual nationals had crossed by Wednesday evening.
As well as the unspecified number of Britons, they included 31 Austrians, five French nationals, four Italians and some Americans.
Médecins Sans Frontières said 22 of its international staff had successfully crossed.
Egyptian state-run Al-Qahera News TV broadcast footage showing what it said was the first group getting off a coach, which included many women and young children.
Mohammed Ghalayini, a British scientist from Manchester who had been in Gaza visiting family when the war began, accompanied his uncle to the crossing after he was named by Gaza authorities on the list of potential evacuees.
""People are really afraid of what's going on and so if they have a chance to leave, they're trying to leave,"" he told the BBC.
""But getting to the border is a struggle as well, because fuel supplies are short,"" he added. ""So you know, I saw people arriving on a donkey cart with their luggage at the border.""
Other British nationals hoping to cross in the coming days include the parents-in-law of Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf.
He welcomed news that the border was opening up, but said his in-laws were trapped without clean drinking water and with rapidly diminishing supplies.
Also on Wednesday, another an Israeli air strike destroyed several residential buildings in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, for the second day in a row.
Video footage and photos showed a scene of devastation in the north-western Fallujah area, with hundreds of people searching for survivors underneath rubble and shattered buildings.
The Hamas-run health ministry said dozens of people were killed or wounded in the attack.
On Wednesday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a statement saying its fighter jets ""struck a Hamas command and control complex"" in Jabalia.
""We can confirm that Hamas terrorists were eliminated in the strike,"" it added.
""Hamas deliberately builds its terror infrastructure under, around and within civilian buildings, intentionally endangering Gazan civilians.""
The IDF also said it had been urging residents of Jabalia and other parts of northern Gaza to evacuate ""to mitigate harm to civilians"", as tanks and troops continue to advance from a number of directions.
On Tuesday, the IDF said a strike in the centre of Jabalia camp had killed a senior Hamas commander and ""a large number of terrorists"" inside ""underground terror infrastructure"" embedded beneath buildings. The infrastructure and buildings had collapsed as a result, it added.
Gaza's health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead.
Hamas denied that the commander was dead but said seven of the hostages taken from Israel, including three foreign passport holders, were killed in the strike - a claim that could not be verified.
In a brief statement on X on Wednesday, the UN human rights office warned: ""Given the high number of civilian casualties & the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes.""
UN Secretary General António Guterres's spokesman also said he was ""appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza"" and reiterated that all parties must abide by international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution.

Netanyahu says Israel will have security control over Gaza after war,2023-11-07,BBC,By Raffi Berg,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will have ""overall security responsibility"" for the Gaza Strip ""for an indefinite period"".
Mr Netanyahu's first comments on Israel's plan for Gaza after the war came in an interview with the ABC News network in the US.
However, he did not elaborate on the kind of security mechanism such a plan would involve.
Israel says it aims to destroy Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007.
Hundreds of Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities and a music festival on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people, Israeli authorities say, in the bloodiest such event in Israel's history.
Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western governments, including the UK - also took 242 people hostage, the Israeli military says.
Israel declared war on Hamas the same day and has been attacking Gaza from land, sea and air since then.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more more than 10,000 people have been killed since Israel began its operation.
When asked who should govern Gaza - home to 2.2 million Palestinians - after the war, Mr Netanyahu said only ""those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas"".
But he also declared that Israel must have security control.
""I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, have the overall security responsibility, because we have seen what happens when we don't have it.
""When we don't have that security responsibility, we have the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine.""
Before the war, Israel - along with Egypt, which also shares a border with Gaza - blockaded the territory to try to stop weapons reaching the militant Islamist group and prevent it from carrying out attacks.
Israel also controlled its border with Gaza, as well as Gaza's air space and shoreline, implementing a strict security regime and allowing in only certain vetted goods, as well as food, fuel and medicine. Imports were often halted after attacks from the territory.
Despite Israel's controls, Hamas and other armed groups have frequently carried out attacks against it, with Israel repeatedly hitting Gaza with air strikes in response.
Although it is unclear what type of security control Mr Netanyahu envisages, any return to long-term occupation on the ground is likely to be opposed by the international community.
One week after the war began, US President Joe Biden said a re-occupation by Israel of Gaza would be ""a big mistake"".
Although Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, the UN considers the territory as remaining under Israeli occupation.

More than 10 Britons feared dead or missing in Israel,,BBC,By Doug Faulkner & Nick Beake,"More than 10 British citizens are feared dead or missing after the Hamas attack on Israel, an official UK source has told the BBC.
The victims include a 20-year-old soldier and a Scottish grandfather.
The UK government believes up to 60,000 British nationals are in Israel or Gaza. It has said it is assisting families but no evacuation is planned.
The latest official death toll from Israel is 900. Palestinian authorities say 260 have died in air strikes.
Here is what we know about British victims so far.
The 20-year-old attended North London's JFS Jewish School before moving to Israel to serve in the military.
Its headteacher said the school's community is ""devastated"" and ""heartbroken"" at the news of his death.
He added: ""Nathanel is fondly remembered within the school and we think of him with nothing but love.""
Mr Young's funeral, held at Israel's national cemetery Mount Herzl, was interrupted after loud bangs were heard over Jerusalem.
The authorities had asked that no more than 50 people attend the open-air service so that it did not become a target for militants.
In the end more than 1,000 turned out and listened as Mr Young's younger brother Elliot paid tribute to him.
But when his sister started to remember him, an emergency siren pierced the tranquillity and prompted mourners to throw themselves to the ground, taking cover under trees and between gravestones.
Repeated explosions could be heard. Some began reciting prayers, others began to video-call loved ones.
After a few minutes, the alarm fell silent, and the funeral continued.
Bernard Cowan, who grew up in Glasgow before settling in Israel with his wife and three children, was killed in the attack, his family confirmed.
They said in a statement: ""We are grieving the loss of our son and brother, Bernard Cowan, who was horrifically murdered on Saturday during the surprise terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas.
""We ask for privacy at this time while we process this huge loss to our family, both at home and in Israel, and to the Jewish community in Glasgow where he will be sorely missed.""
Sammy Stein, chairman of Glasgow Friends of Israel, said Mr Cowan - who was a grandfather - returned to the city often and regularly visited his peace advocacy stall in the city centre.
He told BBC Scotland that Mr Cowan lived ""metres"" from the Gaza barrier, adding: """"It was quiet, it was peaceful and it was in the country. He loved it.""
Mr Marlowe was working as a security guard at the Supernova music festival, where260 people were killed when it was stormedby militants.
The 26-year-old was reported missing from the event, which took place at the Re'im kibbutz around 3.7 miles (6km) from the Gaza barrier.
He also attended North London's JFS Jewish School.
Head teacher David Moody said ""we have seen reports that Jake Marlowe is missing and we all pray that he is found soon"".
The family of Daniel Darlington have said they believe he is among those killed.
In a statement posted on Instagram, his sister referred to him as Danny and ""baby brother"". She said he was killed at the Nir Oz kibbutz alongside a friend.
She wrote: ""Only days before he was riding his bike, laughing, taking photos of sunsets and enjoying life's simple pleasures.""
Daniel had intended to leave for Tel Aviv the day before the militants struck, she wrote, but had decided to stay an extra day to show his friend around the kibbutz.

Humanity blasted and broken: Gaza through a medic's eyes,2023-10-25,BBC,By Fergal Keane,"Warning: This article contains distressing content
There is nothing on his face to convey what he has seen.
The lifeless bodies of children pulled from the rubble. The tents filled with the dead wrapped in white shrouds. Buildings flattened by the devastating force of air strikes. Mahmoud Badawi has seen humanity blasted, burned and broken.
""There are many hard situations,"" he says. ""As an ambulance driver you get used to what is happening. Whether it's hands, heads or bodies that are cut… we are used to this.""
His ambulance races from one scene of carnage to another. In a narrow alley in Gaza, he stops to collect two child casualties of an air strike. A man approaches holding a bundle in his arms. It is a boy who has been badly wounded.
He calls out to a friend who is helping the emergency workers load the casualties, urging him to take extra care with the boy.
""Nasser, his head is open.""
Yet Mahmoud retains his composure. It is not that he is unmoved by all he sees but that necessity demands he focus on those who can be saved. As he speaks to a BBC journalist, there is the sound of a missile exploding.
""We do not rest a lot with all that is happening. The situation is very bad. Now we will try to locate the bombed area to go to the injured and the dead.""
Asked what is the situation with medical supplies Mahmoud says starkly: ""Everything is going.""
According to the Hamas-led health authority in Gaza, more than 6,000 Palestinians have been killed in the last two weeks. Some 40% are reported to be children.
The UN has warned that nearly a third of hospitals and two thirds of primary health care centres have had to close ""due to damage from hostilities or lack of fuel"". The UN says its fuel stocks are running out and that ""tough choices"" will have to be made about what services they prioritise in the coming days.
Israel refuses to allow fuel into the Gaza Strip because it says supplies might be taken by Hamas. It also says the organisation is hoarding fuel.
In Gaza the days and nights blend remorselessly into each other. The war is constant and in this small strip of land -  Gaza's total land area is only 141 sq miles (365 sq km) - it is everywhere.
Israel has ordered around one million residents in the northern half of Gaza to evacuate south. It says this is to enable its forces to target Hamas. But there are continuing Israeli air strikes on southern Gaza, where thousands have fled.
Whether to run; where to run; where to shelter if you do run - every day and night in Gaza is filled with desperate choices.
It also means that for emergency workers there is no going home to a safe place.
When he is out working Mahmoud worries for his wife and six children just as they worry for him. When the bombing is heavy he tries to call every hour. But telephone communication is difficult.
""Connecting with the family is very hard. We barely have service to be able to call and know if they are okay or not.""
Mahmoud has worked hard to raise a family with strong aspirations to serve society. He is proud of his children. There is a daughter studying to be a doctor. She is inspired by her father's work and her own experience of war in Gaza as a child. There is also a son who is a nurse. And another who has qualified as a teacher.
As night comes there is a lull in the bombing. Mahmoud pauses and stands between his ambulance and a pile of rubble. He is holding a stretcher in his left hand, waiting for the next emergency. The adrenaline has subsided. He is briefly motionless and his eyes look off into the distance. They are filled with sadness for all he has seen.

Israel Gaza: Biden's visit is a high-stakes gamble,2023-10-17,BBC,By Sarah Smith,"For an American president, turning up in a warzone is an extraordinary move.
Joe Biden's trip to the Middle East on Wednesday was always going to be a high-stakes gamble.
But he is now flying into an even more volatile situation, after the bombing of a hospital in Gaza that is thought to have killed hundreds of Palestinians.
Hamas has blamed an Israeli air strike, but Israel said the blast at Al Ahli hospital was caused by rockets fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Mr Biden had planned to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and Arab leaders in Jordan.
But just before Air Force One took off from Joint Base Andrews, the summit in Amman was suddenly cancelled.
President Biden will have wanted to look like an honest broker dealing with both sides in the Middle East.
He now faces the embarrassment of being told by the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority that they have no confidence in his ability to end the violence, which they say is in breach of international law.
There is no doubt whose side President Biden is on when it comes to the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
The president described the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October - which left more than 1,400 Israelis dead - as ""sheer evil"", and said the country had a right and a duty to defend itself.
His hastily organised visit is designed to further demonstrate America's firm solidarity with the Jewish state.
But he is having to balance his support for Israel's aim of destroying Hamas with his deep concerns about the civilian and humanitarian cost.
And while he has publicly warned of the need to operate by the ""rules of war"", the message he delivers behind closed doors could be more stern.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US and Israel stood for the rule of law, ""unlike Hamas"".
""This is a foundational element of the discussions we've had with the Israelis forever, and we will continue doing that,"" he said.
The US wants Israel to allow aid into Gaza, and for it to allow safe passage for trapped Americans in Gaza.
After nearly eight hours of talks with Mr Netanyahu on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had made good progress towards these goals, yet still nothing has been agreed.
President Biden is also crucially aware that global public sentiment could quickly change, and support for Israel might evaporate when overwhelmed by images of Palestinian casualties and suffering.
There is also a very real fear that the more brutal the assault on Gaza, the greater the chance that it could trigger a wider conflict in the region with other countries getting involved.
Then there are inevitable security concerns.
The apparatus that accompanies the president abroad is formidable at the best of times, and a short-notice trip to a conflict zone will be a considerable challenge.
Mr Blinken and his entourage were forced to seek shelter in a bunker as air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv on Monday - that would be a difficult look for a president.
This could be one situation in which Mr Biden's age becomes an advantage not a problem.
He has been visiting Israel for 50 years, and he has known Mr Netanyahu for 40 years, describing theirs as a ""frank relationship"".
That will allow for a more robust exchange of views than those that can be shared between leaders who don't have that kind of personal history.
President Biden has clear ideas about what he believes should and should not happen next.
He thinks it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza.
He has said there needs to be a Palestinian Authority and a path to a Palestinian state, even though there has been no progress towards Palestinian statehood for many years.
He will surely want to put the maximum pressure he can on Israel to operate more carefully in Gaza, and to end the conflict as quickly as possible.
The US has consistently been Israel's most loyal and committed ally.
Regardless of who is in the White House, there has always been broad support for the Jewish state and its right to exist in safety and security.
President Biden has for decades been one of the politicians most outspoken in his backing for Israel, saying in 1986 that ""were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect our interests in the region"".
Now it is time for the US president to use all the influence and leverage he has at his disposal to try to limit the bloodshed and loss of life, and prevent an all-out war across the Middle East.
All while events on the ground are making it harder than ever.

'Where do we go?' - Nowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify,,BBC,By Rushdi Abu Alouf,"""Where do we go? Is there a safe place left in this neighbourhood, which was so quiet and beautiful?"" residents of an apartment block in Rimal asked me, with heavy sarcasm.
I had just spent the most difficult seven hours of my life inside there, as Israeli warplanes carried another wave of air strikes in retaliation for the Palestinian militant group's unprecedented assault on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip on Saturday.
The Israeli strikes also caused significant damage to dozens of residential buildings, the offices of telecommunications companies, and faculty buildings of the Islamic University of Gaza.
Terrifying explosions shook the area throughout Monday night. Children were screaming and nobody had a moment's sleep.
It was a night that the residents of Rimal - Gaza City's wealthiest neighbourhood and usually its quietest - will not forget for a long time.
As dawn broke on Tuesday, the intensity of the strikes decreased and people discovered the extent of the destruction. The south-western neighbourhood's infrastructure was severely damaged and most roads leading to it were cut off.
As I drove around it felt as if there had been an earthquake. There was rubble, shattered glass and severed wiring everywhere. Such was the devastation that I did not recognise some of the buildings that I passed.
""I lost everything. My apartment, where my five children lived, was here in this building. My grocery shop below the building was destroyed,"" Mohammed Abu al-Kass told me while carrying his daughter Shahd in the street.
""Where do we go? We have become homeless. There is no shelter for us anymore or work.""
""Are my house and my grocery shop a military target, Israel?"" he added, accusing the Israeli military of lying when it says it does not target civilians.
The Palestinian health ministry said that about 300 people, two thirds of them civilians, were killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza on Monday. It was the deadliest day there for many years.
At least 15 people were killed in the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp, north-east of Gaza City, in the afternoon. The Israeli military said it targeted the home of a Hamas commander. But many people at a nearby market or in neighbouring houses were killed.
The overall death toll in Gaza since Saturday now stands at 900, including 260 children, according to the health ministry. Another 4,500 people have been injured.
The already dire humanitarian crisis in this tiny, overcrowded territory also deepens.
Its 2.2 million residents are running out of food, fuel, electricity and water, after Israel's government ordered a ""complete siege"" and cut off all of Gaza's supplies in response to Hamas's attack.
Saturday's unexpected assault has killed 1,000 people on the Israeli side, and between 100 and 150 hostages have been taken across the border into Gaza by the militants.
""Can you imagine that we are living without power or water in the 21st Century? My baby has run out of nappies and there is only half a bottle of milk left,"" said Waad al-Mughrabi as she looked at the destroyed building next to her home in Rimal.
""Was it my child who attacked Israel?""
Outside Gaza's largest supermarket, which had opened for the first time since Saturday, dozens of people were queuing in front of a small back door. They were hoping to buy whatever provisions they could, fearful that the fighting will last a long time.
Most of Gaza's fresh vegetables and fruits are grown in the south of the territory, and the severe fuel shortage means that transporting them to the north will become increasingly difficult.
So far, there have been no deliveries of food or other essential goods from Egypt, which has maintained a tight blockade of Gaza for security reasons, along with Israel, since Hamas took over the territory in 2007.
People have also been unable to flee Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Only 400 a day are usually allowed in or out, but Israeli air strikes on Monday and Tuesday hit an entry gate on the Palestinian side, stopping any crossings, the Palestinian interior ministry in Gaza said.
That has forced most of the 200,000 people who have fled their homes to take shelter in UN-run schools. Some have fled in fear, while others have seen their homes destroyed by air strikes.
Some Gazans are choosing to shelter in basements, but they risk being trapped inside if the building above collapses. About 30 families were trapped in one basement alone on Monday night.
""In previous wars, this part of the city was a safe haven for residents of areas on the border [with Israel],"" said Rimal resident Mohammed al-Mughrabi.
The Israeli strikes on Monday night showed that nowhere is safe anymore.

Israel Gaza: US rejects calls for ceasefire,,BBC,By Antoinette Radford,"The US has rejected global calls for a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, arguing it is not the ""right answer right now"".
National Security spokesperson John Kirby made the comments on Monday, suggesting instead ""pauses"" to allow aid to be delivered inside Gaza.
Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low.
But Israel has vowed there will be no ceasefire until Hamas is dismantled.
""Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,"" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
Speaking at a press briefing, Mr Kirby said he was confident more aid trucks would be able to enter Gaza via Egypt.
He said the US had spoken to the Israeli government about increasing the number of lorries crossing the border each day to around 100.
About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed.
""We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,"" he told the press briefing.
Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA,previously told the BBC that about 500 trucksa day had entered Gaza before the war started.
Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.
More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago.
Last week, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly called for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas,which was angrily dismissed by Israel.
On Monday, Mr Lazzarini said the system to provide aid would ""fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs"".
Israel began what Mr Netanyahu called the ""second stage"" of a war intended to destroy Hamas on Monday, with ground forces expanding their operations inside Gaza after three weeks of intense bombardment.
