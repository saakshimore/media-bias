Ex-porn star Mia Khalifa expressed support for Palestinians in a series of social media messages, referring to Palestinian terrorists as ""freedom fighters"" while the unprecedented attack on Israel unfolded over the weekend. 
Khalifa, a Lebanese-American performer who was once PornHub’s highest-ranked adult star and famously received threats from ISIS for wearing a hijab while shooting a sex scene, has long referred to Israel as an ""Apartheid"" state. 
""If you can look at the situation in Palestine and not be on the side of Palestinians, then you are on the wrong side of apartheid and history will show that in time,"" Khalifa wrote in a message on X that she pinned to her profile.

EX-PORN STAR MIA KHALIFA OFFERS POLARIZING MARRIAGE ADVICE: 'WE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO LEAVE THESE MEN’
On Saturday as the unprecedented attack began to unfold, Khalifa wrote, ""Can someone please tell the freedom fighters in Palestine to flip their phones and film horizontal."" 
She also reposted a message that said, ""Babe wake up Palestine is getting liberated,"" and mocked video of Israelis fleeing from attackers. Khalifa reposted anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian messages throughout the multipronged terrorist attack that left hundreds dead. Khalifa celebrated as terrifying videos, which included footage of Hamas kidnapping women and children while groups of young partygoers were tied up and taken into Gaza, shocked most onlookers.

EX-PORN STAR MIA KHALIFA'S ISRAEL BASHING CONTINUES: 'MY WINE IS OLDER THAN YOUR APARTHEID STATE'
""It’s FREE PALESTINE until Palestine is FREE,"" she wrote in another post. 
The former porn star also reposted a message that said, ""Me and all my b-----s support Palestine. Me and the girls wil never support genocide. Me and the girls will be there for the fall of Israel"" and reposted a clip of Malcolm X saying, ""You don't get freedom peacefully. Freedom is never safeguarded peacefully. Anyone who is depriving you of freedom isn't deserving of a peaceful approach by the ones who are being deprived of their freedom."" 
Khalifa also shared an image of armed Palestinian terrorists and wrote, ""This is a renaissance painting,"" and has been trashing American celebrities who express support for Israel. 
Khalifa has doubled down on any backlash along the way. 
""I’d say supporting Palestine has lost me business opportunities, but I’m more angry at myself for not checking whether or not I was entering into business with Zionists. My bad,"" she wrote. 
ISRAEL DECLARES WAR AFTER HAMAS SURPRISE ATTACK, LAUNCHES RETALIATORY AIRSTRIKES IN GAZA
When criticized for asking the terrorists to turn their phones horizontally she responded, ""I just wanna make sure there’s 4k footage of my people breaking down the walls of the open air prison they’ve been forced out of their homes and into so we have good options for the history books that write about how how they freed themselves from apartheid.""
Extremists in Khalifa's native Lebanon fired 12 rockets into Israel on Monday, stoking fears that the terror group Hezbollah may join the conflict with Israel.
In 2021, Khalifa came under fire for mocking Israel for having a young history. 
""My wine is older than your apartheid ‘state,’"" Khalifa wrote alongside a photo of herself sipping French wine. 
The controversial post came less than a month after Khalifa labeled one of Israel's best-known actresses, Gal Gadot, a ""genocide barbie"" over her position on the Israeli-Palestinian violence.

Pro-Palestinian activists in US cheer Hamas taking hostages from music festival: ‘Honor our martyrs’,2023-10-09,Fox News,['Hannah Grossman'],"Former National Security Adviser Amb. Robert O'Brien breaks down how he would advise President Biden on the war response.
Pro-Palestinian protesters cheered an individual lauding Hamas terrorists taking festival attendees hostages in Gaza, as activists gathered outside the Israeli consulate in New York on Sunday. 
One video from the event showed a man speaking in the center of a crowd, followed by a young woman who praised the Islamist ""martyrs."" 
""When the Palestinians broke through the fence… as you might have seen, there was some sort of rave or desert party were they were having a great time until the resistance came in electrified hang gliders and took at least several dozen hipsters,"" the man said to cheers. ""But I'm sure they're doing very fine despite what the New York Post says."" 
The Israelis ""were so arrogant"" in thinking they were safe, ""but just less than 24 hours ago, on the land, from the sea and from the air, the people of the Gaza Strip- [loud cheers] …our young people are riding their bikes through these settlements where they were told they could never go because of apartheid,"" the male speaker said. 
LIVE UPDATES: ISRAEL AT WAR WITH HAMAS AFTER SURPRISE ATTACKS, AROUND 900 ISRAELIS DEAD

He continued, ""Our farmers, the farmers of Gaza, you know, they say they can't even have tractors. They say that's terrorist equipment. Well, unfortunately for them, the tractors of these various so called kibbutz settlements have been liberated and taken back to the farms of Gaza…[loud cheers].""
After his remarks, a female speaker from ""The Palestinian Youth Movement"" then said, ""Thank you… for raising your voices to celebrate the glorious victory of the resistance. And to honor our martyrs and [we're] marching to show those here in the heart of the empire that they will never defeat our struggle. They have failed to break the unity of our people, and they have failed to dampen the revolutionary spirit of our people who grow stronger every day."" 
Hamas terrorists rode motorcycles into Israeli neighboring towns, executing people and families at random and taking hostages. 
Witnesses of the attack on the music festival say Hamas gunmen opened fire on a crowd, at least 260 were reported dead as of Monday. 
One festival attendee told Tablet Magazine, ""Women have been raped at the area of the rave next to their friends bodies, dead bodies.""
Videos showed women with blood dripping down their crotches being taken into Gaza. Others showed a barely-clothed attendee being paraded around the strip.

As of Monday, reports said Hamas took over 100 hostages – including children, women and the elderly – and then threatened to begin broadcasting the executions live on TV in response to Israeli airstrikes. Israel has yet to respond to the ultimatum, but the Israeli Defense Forces have deployed tens of thousands of troops to the area to besiege Gaza. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also warned that a ground invasion may be imminent, telling President Biden, ""We have to go in."" 
Israel has already cut off supplies of water, electricity and fuel to Gaza. So far, Israeli air strikes have killed some 560 people, according to Hamas-backed authorities.

A prominent Republican lawmaker is calling on a left-wing fundraising juggernaut to stop processing contributions for Hamas-sympathizing groups.
ActBlue, the leading fundraising platform for Democrat campaigns and groups nationwide, processes donations for a handful of organizations that have partaken in or amplified rallies celebrating Hamas' bloody Oct. 7 attack on innocent Israeli civilians that left more than 1,200 dead and hundreds taken hostage.

""It's shocking that Democrats' primary fundraising vehicle is helping bankroll antisemitic protests across the country where Hamas terrorists are honored as martyrs,"" Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told Fox News Digital.
""ActBlue should cut off access to these pro-Hamas groups or Democrats should leave the platform,"" Daines said.
ActBlue, which has helped raise more than $12 billion for Democrat politicians and causes, helps round up donations for several groups that have backed rallies in support of Hamas' bloody incursion or issued statements supporting it.
One such group for which ActBlue helped process donations is the U.S.-Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), the Daily Caller reported. The USPCN has hosted multiple protests to celebrate Hamas' deadly aggression on Israeli civilians.

In October, the USPCN organized an ""All Out for Palestine"" protest in Houston, where protesters praised Hamas as ""martyrs."" They also organized identical rallies in other areas, such as Detroit, where protesters chanted, ""When people are occupied, violence is justified.""
Fox News' Joe Schoffstall contributed to this report.


The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff responded to mounting concerns that China poses a serious threat to U.S. security, while also arguing NATO is ""stronger than it's ever been.""
""The first thing I'd tell them is they ought to be very proud of their military, if we're ready for whatever comes our way,"" Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. told Fox News' Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday"" at the Reagan National Defense Forum.
""At the same time, we want to be so ready that we don't have a conflict,"" Brown added. ""And you know, as we're here, it says ‘peace through strength.' Our strength that we demonstrate as a military will bring that peace.""

Brown was responding to a Ronald Reagan Institute poll that found 51% of Americans see China as the nation posing the greatest threat to the U.S., up from the 43% of Americans who reported the same at this time last year.
The poll also found a majority of Americans believe that over the next 10 years, China will outpace the U.S. both from a military standpoint and economically. Brown explained that he is focused on ""accelerating change"" in order to keep up.
""Well, my real role here and job is to actually make sure that… on the military side that doesn't occur, which is why I'm so focused on accelerating change,"" he said.
""It's why I'm focused on the collaboration we do, particularly having gotten out here the past couple years, not only here to Reagan, but also out to Silicon Valley, and looking at how we work together on our national defense and how that helps us economically,"" he went on.

A U.S. official told Fox News that American forces killed five Iranian proxy fighters in a one-way drone strike in northern Iraq near Erbil on Sunday.
According to the official, the militants were observed preparing a drone or rocket attack believed to target U.S. forces. American forces carried out the strike before the weapons could be launched.
Iraqi security forces confirmed to the U.S. that five militants died. The attacks were not pre-planned.
U.S. forces have been attacked at least 75 times in the Middle East since October 17, amid the escalation of the Israel-Hamas war. The incidents have occurred in Iraq and Syria.

The guided missile destroyer USS Carney (DDG 64) patrols the waters of the Gulf.


U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) released a statement announcing that three international vessels in the Red Sea were attacked four times on Sunday.
During the attacks, the USS Carney shot down three drones linked to Yemeni Houthis.
""Today, there were four attacks against three separate commercial vessels operating in international waters in the southern Red Sea,"" the statement explained. ""These three vessels are connected to 14 separate nations.""
""The Arleigh-Burke Class destroyer USS CARNEY responded to the distress calls from the ships and provided assistance,"" the press release added.
On Sunday morning, the USS Carney first detected that Houthi ballistic missiles were headed towards Unity Explorer, a vessel owned and operated by the United Kingdom. The USS Carney shot down the Houthi unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) headed towards United Explorer and did not incur any damage or injuries to personnel.

After the first incident, the Unity Explorer was struck on Sunday afternoon by another UAV and sustained minor damage. The USS Carney destroyed another UAV that was headed towards the ship.
Two other vessels named Number 9 and Sophie II were struck by missiles that afternoon. The USS Carney was able to shoot down a UAV headed towards Sophie II.
""These attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security. They have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world,"" CENTCOM added. ""We also have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran.""
""The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international allies and partners,"" the press release concluded.


Israeli Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Eliav Benjamin appeared on ""Fox News Live"" on Sunday to talk about the latest developments from the Israel-Hamas war.
During the interview, Benjamin said that the Israeli military is ""very careful"" about mitigating harm to civilians in Gaza.

""We are very careful with what we're doing when it comes to try[ing] not to affect those who are noncombatants,"" the official explained. ""At the end of the day, we need to remember that we are after Hamas.""
""We are after the terrorists and we are after taking them out and their ability to ever govern or orchestrate any terrorist attacks in the future,"" Benjamin added.
Benjamin also said that Israel is ""continuing to do everything we possibly can to get [hostages] released immediately.""
""We've seen the release so far of 110 hostages. There are still 137 or so who are still in captivity in Gaza held by Hamas and other terrorist entities there,"" he said. ""We are calling for the international community to lean on Hamas, to release them unconditionally.""


White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Sunday blamed Hamas for ending the temporary cease-fire agreement with Israel. 
In an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Kirby told host Shannon Bream that the United States believes eight or nine Americans are still held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, including one woman whose condition and whereabouts are unknown.
""We just don’t have perfect visibility,"" Kirby said. ""We’re at this literally by the hour, and we want to get that [cease-fire] put back in place so that, again, more hostages can come out.""

The coming week marks two months since the horrible Hamas terror attack on Israel that left 1,200 dead and 240 held hostage. 
And it also marks our second trip to the region during this crisis. Some things have gotten a bit better.

There were over a hundred hostages freed and some relief aid made it to the battered people of Gaza during the brief cease-fire in fighting. 
But to a large degree, things have gotten worse and more complicated.

Former Ambassador-At-Large Nathan Sales appeared on ""FOX News Live"" on Sunday to discuss recent attacks against American forces in the Middle East by Iranian proxies.

""Iran is behind everything that we're seeing in terms of attacks directed on U.S. forces,"" Sales explained. ""We're seeing Iranian proxies attack Americans in Syria and Iraq and now from Yemen. And they're going to keep doing it until we make them stop.""
Sales argued that the U.S. military will need to do more than ""blowing up empty munitions depots in the desert in the middle of the night,"" in order to mitigate the strikes.
""You're going to actually have to take action and take strikes against the people responsible for these attacks,"" he said. ""And that doesn't just mean the proxies. That also means the Iranian puppet masters, the ones who are pulling the strings.""
The former ambassador added that the Yemeni Houthi movement, which was considered a terrorist organization under the Trump administration and taken off the list when President Biden came into office, should be reclassified as terrorists.

""Within weeks of taking office, the Biden administration took them off the terror list,"" Sales said. ""Maybe they need to reconsider that and put them back on.""

Harvard whistleblower points to 'undisguised calls for the murder of Jews' amid federal probe

A Harvard alum called on the U.S. Department of Education to expand its probe of the university to include the Ivy League school's ""laissez-faire attitude"" toward protesters' ""undisguised calls for the murder of Jews.""
The new allegations are based on concerns over Harvard's lack of response to anti-Israel demonstrators who appeared to call for violence against Jews in Israel just a day after the DOE announced their investigation.

In a letter addressed to OCR's Boston chief attorney Kristi R. Harris on Saturday, the alum thanked Harris for opening the investigation but called for its expansion. 
""Harvard Hillel has reported that on November 29—a day after OCR notified me (and, presumably, Harvard) that it had opened a Title VI investigation—Harvard College students ‘had classes disrupted by a coordinated protest using bullhorns to blast abhorrent antisemitic calls to ""globalize the intifada,"" and demands for the elimination of the Jewish state ""from the river to the sea,""'"" the letter says, citing an Instagram post by Harvard Hillel. 
""Both are undisguised calls for the murder of Jews and Israelis,"" the alum added.

Fox News’ Greg Palkot joined ‘Cavuto Live’ to report on the latest news emerging from the Israel-Hamas war in the first days since the cease-fire ended.
Israeli military officials say they are preparing for the next stage in the war as they turn their forcus to southern Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to ""destroy"" Hamas, but there remains an extensive civilian presence in the southern region.

Former Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite joined Fox News to discuss the U.S. response to attacks on U.S. troops by Iran-backed proxies and the U.S. military presence and capability in the Middle East.
Braithwaite argued on Saturday that the U.S. is not doing enough to stabilize the region as Israel continues its war against Hamas. The U.S. has sought to deter Iran and its proxies from entering the conflict, but Hezbollah and Houthi rebels have ramped up attacks on U.S. bases and Israeli forces.

Roughly 140 hostages remain in Hamas custody in Gaza.

UK-owned ship struck by rocket in the Red Sea: Report

A U.K.-owned trading vessel was struck by a rocket while passing the Yemeni coast in the Red Sea on Sunday.

The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency says it received ""a report of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) activity including a potential explosion... originating from the direction of Yemen,"" according to the Agence France-Presse. The organization did not report any injuries in the incident.
Tensions are rising in the region after Iran-backed Houthi rebels hijacked a vessel in the region last month. The terrorist group attempted an assault on another Israeli-linked vessel last week.

Hezbollah anti-tank missile strikes Israeli vehicle, wounds IDF troops


Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for an anti-tank missile strike against an Israeli vehicle in northern Israel on Sunday.
Israeli Defense Forces say multiple troops were ""lightly injured"" in the attack, while Hezbollah claims the attack resulted in at least one fatality. Israeli has responded with artillery fire on the launch site.
""Following the warning in the north of the country, an anti-tank missile was detected at an IDF vehicle in the Beit Hillel area. As a result, the vehicle was damaged. A number of IDF soldiers were slightly injured as a result of shrapnel,"" the IDF wrote in a statement. ""Also, several launches were detected in the Har Dov area. Some of them fell in the territory of Lebanon. IDF forces attack the sources of the fire with artillery fire.""

Hezbollah acknowledged the attack in its own statement on Sunday.
""In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in support of their brave and honorable resistance, the Mujahideen of the Islamic Resistance, at 1:10 pm on Sunday 12/3/2023, targeted a military vehicle at the Beit Hilal base with guided missiles, killing and wounding its crew,"" the terrorist group wrote.

Lloyd Austin says protection of Gaza civilian must be 'strategic imperative' for Israel

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says he has ""repeatedly"" urged Israeli officials to do more to protect civilians in Gaza in recent weeks.
Austin spoke at
 the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Saturday, saying the civilians of Gaza are the ""center of gravity"" for the ongoing conflict. Israel has continued its campaign against Hamas in southern Gaza after cease-fire negotiations broke down on Friday.
""In this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat,"" Austin said.
""So I have repeatedly made clear to Israel's leaders that protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral responsibility and strategic imperative,"" he added.

Israeli forces have discovered 800 Hamas tunnel shafts infesting northern Gaza


Israeli forces say they have uncovered 800 Hamas tunnel shafts leading to the terrorist organization's underground labyrinth as of Sunday.
The IDF says it has destroyed some 500 of the shafts, but many remain open. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari posted footage of Israeli soldiers destroying the access points on social media on Sunday.
Israel is continuing its campaign into southern Gaza this week, where Hamas is expected to have a similar underground network.



Israel urges evacuations aroung Khan Younis as campaign against Hamas in southern Gaza ramps up

Israel urged Gaza residents in several areas around the southern city of Khan Younis to resign on Sunday as Israeli forces press Hamas.

Israel's UN ambassador slams Soros for donations to 'pro-Hamas groups' seeking destruction of Israel


Left-wing activist billionaire George Soros is facing intense criticism from Israel’s ambassador to the U.N. for pumping over $15 million into a network of nongovernmental organizations that allegedly support Hamas.
""George Soros’ donations to organizations that seek the destruction of the State of Israel as a Jewish state is shameful. However, I am not surprised,"" Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan told Fox News Digital.
Hamas launched a full-blown invasion into southern Israel Oct. 7, resulting in the mass murder of 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans. Hamas also took more than 200 hostages. American citizens were among civilians kidnapped by the jihadi terrorist entity.

""For years, Soros has backed and transferred money to organizations supporting BDS that want to isolate Israel,"" added Erdan, who has been leading the diplomatic campaign at the U.N. to spell out Hamas’ crimes against humanity. ""They have never been about real peace or any solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""
BDS is an abbreviation for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign targeting the Jewish state. The German and Austrian parliaments classified BDS as an antisemitic movement that resembles the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses during the nascent phase of the Holocaust.
Rachel Ehrenfeld, author of ""The Soros Agenda,"" told Fox News Digital, ""Support of pro-Hamas, pro-Palestinian groups in the U.S. is not limited to foreign entities. It also comes directly and indirectly from U.S.-based foundations. George and Alexander Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF) is one of them.""

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A group of released Israeli hostages held their first public address in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, days after being freed from Hamas captivity.
Hadas Kalderon, the mother of 13-year-old former hostage Erez Kalderon and 16-year-old former hostage Sahar Kalderon, called her children ""my own private superheroes.""
She said that her kids compared their experience in Gaza to the popular video game Fortnite.

""My own private superheroes survived and returned,"" Kalderon said. ""According to them, it was the war game Fortnite. A game that has become a reality, a reality that is beyond imagination.""
The mother said that her husband is still in Gaza and called for him to be released.
""Their father, Ofer Kalderon, is still there,"" she added. ""Sahar wants a father! Erez wants a father!""

"AP’s Gaza reporter repeatedly ripped Israel on social media, said oppressive regime should be ‘overthrown’",2023-10-13,Fox News,['David Rutz'],"'America's Newsroom' anchor Bill Hemmer details the ongoing developments in Israel ahead of a ground invasion of Gaza. Former DHS adviser Fran Townsend provides analysis. 
A reporter for the Associated Press based in Gaza has a social media history of blasting Israel as an oppressive, apartheid regime, leading to criticism that he can't objectively cover the conflict.
An extensive report from HonestReporting, a media watchdog, laid out Issam Adwan's extensive past of shredding Israel, including calling it an ""apartheid"" regime, saying it would be a triumph if it was ""overthrown,"" and comparing the Jewish state to the Nazis. Adwan has been reporting this week for the AP from Gaza after Israel declared war on Hamas following the Palestinian terror group's brutal attack Saturday.
In one now-deleted post on X, formerly known as Twitter, exactly one year ago, he wrote, the ""Palestinian revolt against the Israeli oppression will be a triumph"" and ""every colonial system will be overthrown. Meanwhile, you should reflect on what you did to contribute to it.""
In another, he states, ""It's simple to identify which side you take… Supporting colonialism and apartheid is never ok to the human common sense.""
SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL ADMITS ISRAEL ATTACKS HAD BEEN PLANNED FOR YEARS UNDER GUISE OF GOVERNING GAZA
He also told an Israeli in 2019, ""Don't listen to the lies they told you about us. They're spreading lies and fear to continue with the apartheid system which [separates] us of different races and religions.""
In 2021, he wrote, ""To all ignorants playing ‘Hamas/Khamas’ card when we talk about Israeli war crimes/apartheid//ethnic cleansing, Hamas has been established in 1987 while this ongoing genocide happens in 1948. How many massacres and killings Israel did before that? Educate yourselves."" In 2019, he referred to ""resistance parties and movements,"" in a reply to a Twitter post criticizing Islamic Jihad, a terrorist group active in the Gaza Strip.
At another point last year, he compared Israel to Nazis, calling it a ""racist regime that is so similar to the Nazis.""
HonestReporting also shared a screenshot of him resharing a post by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, accusing Israeli forces of being ""involved in a systematic campaign to poison water wells of indigenous Palestinians as part of 1948 ethnic cleansing."" 
He has also gotten into social media spats with critics of Hamas, the terrorist organization that governs the Gaza Strip.
""LET'S BE CRYSTAL CLEAR,"" he wrote in 2021. ""DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THE ROCKETS OF HAMAS.. DON'T ASK ME ABOUT ‘VIOLENT’ PROTESTS AROUND PALESTINE. WE HAVE BEEN IN THIS GENOCIDE FOR 73 YEARS.... 73 YEARS OF NIGHTMARES. ASK ME ABOUT CHILD'S SLAUGHTER. STOP BEING IGNORANT FOR ONCE.""
Adwan has posted several AP dispatches from Gaza as it comes under bombardment since Israel declared war on Hamas. The terrorist organization launched a surprise attack on Saturday against Israel, killing hundreds of civilians and taking at least 150 hostages. The gruesome violence perpetrated by Hamas has left much of the world appalled, but pockets of supporters have continued to support Palestinian ""resistance"" to Israel.
Adwan's stories for the AP recently have concentrated on the civilian toll from Israel's military strikes.
""Israel accuses Hamas of endangering Gaza’s civilian population by placing weapons and missile launchers in densely populated areas. It also accuses them of using civilians as human shields,"" Adwan wrote for the wire service on Wednesday. ""But the military long has carried out airstrikes in crowded residential neighborhoods, inevitably harming civilians and civilian infrastructure.""
THEY'RE ‘CELEBRATING’ A ‘MASSACRE OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS’: JEWISH COLLEGE STUDENTS DENOUNCE ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST
The AP told Fox News Digital that Adwan has been removed from reporting duties while it investigates his past further.
Issam Adwan is a Gaza native and activist who joined the Associated Press in August. 
""Issam Adwan was taken off of reporting duties a few days ago while we look into this,"" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.
Adwan didn't respond to a separate request for comment.
A native of Gaza, Adwan joined the AP in August after prior reporting stints with Middle East Eye and Al Jazeera English. He also served as project manager for ""We Are Not Numbers,"" a Palestinian storytelling project, and the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict Resolution. He has been an advocate throughout his life for Palestinians and what he views as unfair treatment against his people by the Israelis and their allies.
This isn't the first time the AP has tapped someone with a history of bashing Israel for a news position. In 2021, the AP hired and then fired a recent Stanford graduate as a news associate, after her history of anti-Israel social media posts came to light.

Groups of pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, with some chanting and singing ""Palestine will be free"" while others glued themselves to the street along the parade route.
One group of protesters took to the parade route in midtown Manhattan and unfurled a banner reading, ""Liberation for Palestine and Planet."" They called for an end to fossil fuels while supporting Palestinians in Gaza.
The protesters wore white jumpsuits, doused themselves with red liquid and glued their hands to the street to try to disrupt the parade. The crowd lining the sidewalk could be heard drowning out the chants with boos.
NYPD officers were seen removing the protesters from the street and taking them away from the scene so that the parade could continue.

Israel’s military has discovered unspeakable horrors in an Israeli community that was attacked by Hamas on Saturday, including dozens of dead babies, some with their heads chopped off, Israeli media reported.
According to local Israeli outlet i24News, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers moved into Kfar Aza, one of the communities Hamas terrorists invaded early Saturday morning, and discovered about 40 dead babies, some decapitated — highlighting the brutality of the invading forces. 
The IDF were removing the bodies of victims found in the area when they found the children's remains. Israeli soldiers are attempting to use bones to identify the victims, according to the report.
""It’s not a war, it’s not a battlefield. You see the babies, the mother, the father, in their bedrooms, in their protection rooms, and how the terrorists killed them,"" IDF Maj. Gen. Itai Veruv said, describing the scene, i24News reported.

On Saturday morning, Hamas-led forces poured over the Israel-Gaza border while residents were sleeping, dragging people into the streets, taking some hostage while beheading and killing others. More than 700 Israelis, including men, women, children and the elderly, were indiscriminately killed in one day — the largest terror attack in a single day in Israel’s history.
The Israeli army allowed members of the media into Kibbutz Kfar Aza, which is located less than a quarter of a mile from the Gaza border.
In the city, residents were murdered and their bodies left lying in the streets. Cars were completely burned and the devastation was extended to buildings, some of which were abandoned and destroyed.

The United States will accelerate its humanitarian assistance into Gaza, including food, fuel and medical supplies, with the first of three relief flights beginning this week, Fox News has learned.
The U.S. military will be sending a series of items, which also include supplies to help Palestinians survive the upcoming winter conditions, to North Sinai and Egypt on Tuesday, according to senior administration officials. Additional plane loads of supplies and aid will then be sent in the coming days, the officials said.
Additional talks are in the works with the Israeli government on how to allow even more assistance to the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza, many of whom have been displaced from their homes and face unsustainable living conditions in south and central Gaza, where about 80% of the Gaza Strip population now lives.
These supplies and fuel are not linked to the release of hostages, the officials said. As of Tuesday, Hamas has released 58 hostages, 40 of them Israeli, while Israel has released roughly 150 Palestinian prisoners.

Another key point of further aid was urging caution in Israel’s continued operations in Gaza. The U.S. emphasized to Israel that when its military continues its ground operation into southern Gaza, after the current cease-fire ends, it should do so in a way so as not to produce further displacement of Palestinians, according to the senior administration officials.
Southern Gaza is now more densely packed than it was before the ground operation started as those residents of northern Gaza fled south. Should the same displacement that took place in the North be replicated in the south, then U.N. facilities and other humanitarian care facilities would become overwhelmed, exacerbating the crisis.

Since the allowance of aid, senior administration officials said the U.S. and the United Nations have sustained 240 trucks of aid per day. The assistance includes significant quantities of fuel, which is critical for maintaining infrastructure, water desalination plants, hospitals, pumping of water from wells, sewerage pumping, solid waste removal and other essential functions.
The negotiations include providing commercial goods to Gaza, and an increase in volume to about 300 or 400 trucks per day. Any proposal would need to include quicker inspection procedures, the officials said.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken took to social media Sunday regarding Hamas' deadly strikes on Israel, but one post was taken down following some online backlash.
""Turkish Foreign Minister @HakanFidan and I spoke further on Hamas’ terrorist attacks on Israel. I encouraged Türkiye’s advocacy for a cease-fire and the release of all hostages held by Hamas immediately,"" read Blinken’s post on X, formerly Twitter, according to the New York Post.
Pandemonium broke out over the internet while the post was up.

Media running Hamas narrative on Gaza hospital ‘directly contributed’ to endangering US embassies abroad,2023-10-26,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"FOX News chief political analyst Brit Hume weighs in on the media's coverage of an explosion at a Gaza hospital.
The legacy media's widely panned coverage of last week's Gaza hospital exposition has had a ripple effect across the world that goes beyond the usual ramifications of a journalistic error.
Several news organizations from The New York Times, to CNN, to the BBC, to the Associated Press rushed to report claims made by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry that Israel bombed Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital through an airstrike resulting in over 500 civilian casualties. But subsequent reporting and intelligence found it was an explosion in the hospital's parking lot stemming from a misfired rocket fired by Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, resulting in a death toll a fraction of what Hamas had first alleged.
The fake news prompted several Arab leaders to cancel their meetings with President Biden, who had flown overseas only having sat down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Morgan Ortagus, former State Department spokesperson during the Trump administration and founder of Polaris National Security, told Fox News Digital the media's disinformation push ""directly contributed"" to the riots that erupted outside U.S. embassies in several Middle East countries which continues a ripple effect, putting Americans overseas in danger.

""That in turn requires the military to scramble to send more reinforcements to the embassies. And, if the riots get worse, we will have to evacuate,"" Ortagus said. ""It is enormously expensive and requires us to divert forces from other theaters, like Asia, to deal with the emergency situation created from actual fake news.""
Hamas' narrative was debunked by evidence brought forth by the IDF and intelligence from the Biden administration. In-depth analysis from multiple news outlets, including those who initially peddled the disinformation, also concluded Israel was not responsible for the explosion. 
""Such a glaring example of major outlets messing up on a very consequential event helps explain why trust in traditional news media has been falling fast,"" The Atlantic's Yascha Mounk wrote Monday. ""Journalists and media executives understandably tend to apportion blame for their failings elsewhere. If people no longer trust quality outlets, the fault must lie with the ‘misinformation’ they encounter on social media. But such an easy allocation of responsibility won’t work when, marching in unison, major news organizations seem to have fouled up in as blatant a way as they have over this past week.""
EX-NYT REPORTER BLASTS PAPER FOR SPREADING ‘MODERN-DAY BLOOD LIBEL’ FOLLOWING BOTCHED GAZA HOSPITAL COVERAGE
The New York Times, far from the only outlet that botched its coverage of the explosion, received the most condemnation for sending a push alert to its readers blaring the headline ""Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians Say."" Critics also pointed out how the article used a photo showing Gaza devastation unrelated to the one it was reporting on. CNN has also added a note to its initial reporting, admitting it ""did not clearly attribute claims about Israel’s responsibility to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza.""

On Monday, The Times published a lengthy editor's note admitting it relied ""too heavily"" on Hamas' word.
""Early versions of the coverage — and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert and social media channels — relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified. The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was,"" the Times acknowledged. ""Given the sensitive nature of the news during a widening conflict, and the prominent promotion it received, Times editors should have taken more care with the initial presentation, and been more explicit about what information could be verified. Newsroom leaders continue to examine procedures around the biggest breaking news events — including for the use of the largest headlines in the digital report — to determine what additional safeguards may be warranted.""
MEDIA HAS EGG ON ITS FACE FOR ALLOWING HAMAS TO SET INITIAL TONE OF GAZA HOSPITAL COVERAGE WITHOUT SKEPTICISM
The Free Press editor Bari Weiss, a former Times opinion page editor, raked the paper over the coals for ""publishing Hamas PR"" and its subsequent ""soft non-apology,"" juxtaposing this episode to the drama that unfolded after the Times ran the now-infamous Sen. Tom Cotton op-ed in 2020 resulting in internal turmoil and multiple resignations despite the fact, as she pointed out, ""there was not a single correctable error in the [Cotton] piece.""

Ortagus drilled down what's she believes is at the center this debacle, telling Fox News Digital ""the media has an antisemitism problem.""
""But it's not just the media-- almost every country in the Middle East, the United Nations, and Democratic Members of Congress, such as Rashida Tlaib, also rushed to believe the word of baby-butchering terrorists who just days before burned whole families alive,"" Ortagus said. ""All of these groups peddled disinformation that caused riots on the streets, and they put both American service members and American diplomats in harm's way. The myth of an independent, non-biased media died a long time ago— now they're just showing us who they really are.""
New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman knocked his paper for its coverage of the story in a podcast appearance, saying a ""newspaper we know very well"" was among those that credulously spread the Hamas framing.
""Islamic Jihad may have achieved its greatest P.R. victory in this war by blowing up its own hospital — inadvertently, by the way,"" he said. ""By all evidence, they launched a part of a missile barrage toward Israel, and as often happens, one of their rockets failed and landed in the parking lot of this hospital… Headlines everywhere — Israel attacks hospital — including in a newspaper that we know very well. And by the time the truth had a chance to put its shoes on, this inflamed the entire Arab world.""

NPR's David Folkenflik said Hamas was used as a ""key source"" by numerous outlets and scolded them for prioritizing speed over accuracy.
""The audiences' perceptions of media outlets' fairness determine how much trust they have — not just in the veracity of specific coverage but the independence of their journalists,"" he wrote. ""Speed may matter a lot to readers, viewers and listeners. Accuracy and fairness still matter more, especially when stakes are so high.""

"Yoon warns South Korea, United States must be ready for ‘Hamas-style’ surprise attack from North Korea",2023-11-12,Fox News,['Danielle Wallace'],"IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht joined ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the latest updates emerging from the Israel-Hamas war.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol reportedly told U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin both of their nations should be ready for ""Hamas-style"" attacks from North Korea in the region. 
The warning came when Yoon invited Austin and U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Q. Brown, Jr. to the presidential residence in Seoul for a meeting over dinner, Yonhap News Agency reported. The outlet, citing presidential spokesperson Lee Do-woon, said Yoon called for ""a vigilant South Korea-US combined defense posture capable of promptly and decisively retaliating against any provocations from North Korea, including surprise attacks resembling Hamas-style tactics due to its miscalculation."" 
Yoon said the Israel-Hamas war and the Ukraine-Russia war are directly and indirectly linked to North Korea. Austin reassured Yoon that President Biden is committed to further strengthening the U.S.-South Korea military alliance, according to Yonhap News Agency, as both allies on Monday are slated to discuss a range of security issues, including ways to bolster Washington’s extended deterrence commitment against North Korea’s missile and nuclear threats. 
The U.S. Department of Defense said Austin attended a ceremony honoring veterans from both countries at the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul after holding talks with South Korean Minister of National Defense Shin Won-sik, and Japanese Defense Minister Kihara Minoru at the South Korean Ministry of National Defense headquarters earlier Sunday.

""Around the world, as you see our troops deployed and working together, it is impressive,"" he said at the ceremony. ""The United States military is the most powerful military in the world, and we absolutely take pride in our relationship with our Korean counterparts.""
Following Sunday’s talks, U.S. defense officials announced that Austin and his South Korean and Japanese counterparts have decided on a mechanism to facilitate the exchange of real-time missile warning data to improve each country's ability to monitor missiles launched by North Korea. That mechanism is slated to be fully operationalized by the end of December.
The defense ministers also encouraged the development of a multi-year trilateral exercise plan which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of this year. Austin ""also reaffirmed during the talks the United States' steadfast alliance with both countries and the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence backed by the full range of its capabilities,"" according to the Department of Defense.

BLINKEN: US HAS 'REAL CONCERNS' ABOUT RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA MILITARY PARTNERSHIP
In addition to meeting with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul, Austin will also attend the 55th annual Security Consultative Meeting and the United Nations Command inaugural meeting of member states' defense ministers before departing for his final stop in Indonesia.
On Thursday, in talks with South Korea’s leadership, including Yoon, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the growing threat posed by North Korea and its alleged provision of military equipment and munitions to Russia to help it wage war on Ukraine, the State Department said.

""They shared concerns about the DPRK’s provocations in the region and strongly condemned the provision of military equipment and munitions by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to the Russian Federation for use in its war against Ukraine,"" the State Department said of Blinken’s meeting with Yoon, referring to North Korea by its formal name. The Blinken-Yoon meeting also covered improving relations between South Korea and Japan as well as the importance of three-way cooperation between Washington, Tokyo and Seoul, the State Department said.

BLM chapter sparks outrage after posting pro-Palestinian cartoon referencing Hamas terrorists,2023-10-11,Fox News,['Kendall Tietz'],"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre turned up the heat on members of the far-left ""Squad"" during Tuesday's press briefing, blasting their comments on the war between Israel and Hamas as ""wrong,"" ""repugnant,"" and ""disgraceful.""
The Chicago Black Lives Matter chapter sparked outrage on Tuesday after it posted a graphic of a paraglider with the Palestinian flag that read ""I Stand With Palestine."" The group has since deleted the post. 
The BLM Chicago account accompanied the X post with the caption ""That is all that is it!"" The post was later updated by X, formerly known as Twitter, with a community note that read ""On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists in paragliders attacked a music festival in Israel, killing over 260 people.""
On Saturday morning, thousands of attendees at the Tribe of Nova music festival in southern Israel were ambushed by Hamas terrorists who killed hundreds and took others captive. Videos of the horrifying rapes, murders, attacks and kidnappings have circulated the news and social media platforms in recent days. 
BLM Chicago addressed the post on X Wednesday morning. 
""Yesterday we sent out msgs that we aren’t proud of,"" the organization wrote on X. ""We stand with Palestine & the people who will do what they must to live free. Our hearts are with, the grieving mothers, those rescuing babies from rubble, who are in danger of being wiped out completely.""

The post prompted backlash from politicians and media figures on both sides of the political aisle. 
""Black Lives Matter Chicago just posted this, celebrating the paragliders who massacred the Israeli concert goers,"" former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich posted. ""Shocking antisemitism and cruelty. Martin Luther King is rolling over in his grave.""
""BLM Chicago stands with terrorists who rape women, murder innocents, & decapitated babies,"" Liz Wheeler, host of The Liz Wheeler Show, posted. 
""Utterly sickening from Black Lives Matter in Chicago,"" Aviva Klompas, Co-founder of Boundless Israel, posted. ""And they have used an image of a paraglider like the ones who swooped into an Israeli music festival and murdered, raped, mutilated, and paraded beaten civilians back to Gaza.""
""You know that they killed civilians at a music festival from those parachutes,"" Ron Desantis' Rapid Response Director Christina Pushaw commented. 
""You support the people chopping heads off babies and gang-raping women. You sick Nazi bastards,"" Jason Bedrick, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, commented. 
BLACK LIVES MATTER LEADER ACCUSED OF STEALING $10M FROM ORGANIZATION: ‘UNJUST ENRICHMENT’
""Take a good look, liberal Jews,"" Karol Markowicz, columnist for the New York Post and Fox News, commented. ""This is the sh-- you supported.""

BLM'S REVENUE DROPPED 88% IN 2022 AFTER SELF-ENRICHMENT SCANDALS, INFIGHTING OVER MONEY
""The official Chicago chapter of Black Lives Matter released a graphic of a Hamas paraglider with the text: ‘I stand with Palestine,’"" journalist Andy Ngo posted. ""A unit of Hamas militants used paragliders and hang gliders to launch their armed massacre of civilians in southern Israel. BLM, like Antifa, has long expressed support for Palestinian terrorism in the name of ‘de-colonialism’ and fighting capitalism.""
A national BLM group, known as Black Lives Matter Grassroots, published a statement to its Instagram page Monday that read, ""Black Lives Matter Grassroots stands in solidarity with our Palestinian family who are currently resisting 57 years of settler colonialism and apartheid."" The caption changed the statement, clarifying it should be ""75 YEARS,"" not 57.
The post proclaimed that because the Palestinians ""have been subject to decades of apartheid and unimaginable violence, their resistance must not be condemned, but understood as a desperate act of self-defense.""
The BLM Grassroots' statement came just after Israel’s military confirmed that it found the remains of 40 Israeli babies massacred by Hamas in a local Israeli village, including some infants that were found decapitated. 
BLM Grassroots continues to promote the BLM message abroad with a coalition of 26 BLM chapters across the U.S. and U.K. It is separate from the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF), which was formerly led by activist and self-described ""trained Marxist"" Patrisse Cullors.

Inside the chaos on Capitol Hill as hundreds of pro-Palestinian Jews arrested: ‘A moral catastrophe’,2023-10-19,Fox News,"['Hannah Ray Lambert', 'Jon Michael Raasch']","Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested after flooding into the Cannon Rotunda on Capitol Hill with signs and chants. Here's what protesters had to say.
WASHINGTON – Protesters from across the country descended on Capitol Hill Wednesday to call for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, with hundreds ending up in handcuffs.
""We were raised saying 'Never again.' Never again is right now. It's this very moment,"" Liv, a member of the activist group Jewish Voice for Peace, told Fox News as demonstrators sang and clapped in the background.

FROM THE DEADLY DESERT RAVE TO THE FRONT LINES, ISRAELI RESERVE SOLDIER RECOUNTS CONCERT MASSACRE
More than 5,000 people have been killed since war broke out between Hamas and Israel.
Thousands of demonstrators swarmed the area in and around the Cannon House Office Building on Wednesday, many wearing black T-shirts reading, ""Jews say ceasefire now!""
About 300 protesters were arrested, including at least three who face charges of assault on a police officer, U.S. Capitol Police told Fox News. Police also confirmed to Fox News that demonstrators inside the Cannon Rotunda will be charged with illegally protesting inside a House office building.
""Civil disobedience is part of how we get messages across, and we need the Congress to hear, we need the president to hear,"" Louisa said while her hands were bound with zip tie handcuffs. ""I feel that Biden needs to stand up and help facilitate a cease-fire so no more people die.""
One member of Jewish Voice for Peace said the demonstration was planned about three days ahead of time. He flew in to D.C. from Kansas City to participate.
""We are here to send a message to President Biden and to Congress, not in our name, cease-fire now,"" Michael said.

He added that the U.S. government has ""a lot of power"" and should de-escalate the conflict.
""We need to stop sending money, stop stationing troops,"" he said.
Protesters said the crowd included dozens of rabbis and children of Holocaust survivors. Some demonstrators compared Israel's actions – past and present – to a ""genocide.""
""It is a moral catastrophe and rather than joining us, they're arresting us,"" Liv said.
JVP previously condemned Hamas' attacks on civilians as ""horrific war crimes."" But the group's former executive director told Fox News that although she feels ""despair and sadness and grief"" for Israeli civilians, the conflict between Palestinians and Israel is not an ""equal situation.""
""The important thing to remember is that this didn't start on Saturday, Oct. 7,"" Rebecca Vilkomerson, former executive director of JVP, said. ""There's been decades and decades of apartheid and dispossession and siege that Israel has been imposing on Palestinian people.""

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT APPEALS SENTENCES FOR PROUD BOYS ALREADY TO SERVE DECADE PLUS OVER JAN. 6 CAPITOL RIOT
The Anti-Defamation League's D.C. chapter condemned the protests Wednesday evening.
""Although they claim to do so, these far-left radical organizations do not represent the overwhelming majority Jewish community,"" ADL DC Regional Director Meredith R. Weisel wrote. ""Rather, these groups are anti-Zionists that challenge Israel's very right to exist. Let's be very clear – anti-Zionism is antisemitism.""
But protesters told Fox News that Jews are not a monolith and that many empathize with the struggle of Palestinians.

""We are rising up in the way that we wish others would have spoken up for our own community to do everything that we can, to risk everything that we have to stop a genocide from unfolding in real time against the Palestinian people in Gaza,"" Jay said as other protesters were arrested nearby.
The demonstrators also included members of the activist group IfNotNow. IfNotNow boasted on X that, as the Capitol protests unfolded, Jews in Boston were also ""committing civil disobedience"" at the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., demanding she call for a cease-fire.

"CBP memo sounds alarm on Hamas, Hezbollah fighters potentially using southern border to enter US",2023-10-23,Fox News,"['Adam Shaw', 'Bill Melugin']","Chris Clem, a former Border Patrol agent in Arizona and Texas, says Americans should be alarmed by the number of got-aways at the southern border.
A Customs and Border Protection (CBP) memo is warning staff of the risk that foreign terrorist fighters engaged in the Israel-Hamas conflict could soon be attempting to enter the United States via the besieged southern border.
In a Friday memo by the agency’s San Diego Field Office's intelligence unit, obtained by Fox News, the agency warns that individuals ""inspired by, or reacting to, the current Israel-Hamas conflict may attempt travel to or from the area of hostilities in the Middle East via circuitous transit across the Southwest border.""
""Foreign fighters motivated by ideology or mercenary soldiers of fortune may attempt to obfuscate travel to or from the US to or from countries in the Middle East through Mexico.""
BORDER PATROL STOPS RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON TERROR WATCH LIST AT SOUTHERN BORDER
The memo, first reported by the Daily Caller, specifically mentions Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Hezbollah.

It warns of possible indicators, including military-age males, the possession of military gear, single travelers, an undetermined return plan and an association with the region.
The memo is the latest sign of ongoing concerns about a potential terrorist threat at the border, just as the U.S. is facing a record number of migrants from across the globe coming to its southern border and overwhelming Border Patrol agents. Those concerns have been renewed in the wake of the attack against Israel by Hamas, sparking concerns that foreign terrorist fighters could use the border as a way to access the United States to launch attacks against the homeland. 
A CBP spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the agency ""has seen no indication of Hamas-directed foreign fighters seeking to make entry into the United States.""
""It is the policy of CBP to neither confirm nor speak to potentially improperly disclosed information or internal documents marked as law enforcement sensitive or for official use only,"" the spokesperson said. ""In general, CBP provides frontline personnel a wide range of context for situational awareness in order to ensure they remain vigilant in fulfillment of our homeland and border security missions. Situational awareness briefs are not threat assessments.""
Official numbers released Saturday show that there were a record number (169) of people encountered by Border Patrol agents at the southern border on the terror watch list in FY 23 – surpassing the numbers encountered in the last six fiscal years combined. The encounters between the ports of entry by Border Patrol are eclipsed by those who are encountered at the ports themselves. Overall, there were 564 encounters at ports of entry, just slightly higher than fiscal year 2019, when there were 538.
The watch list, now officially called the Terrorist Screening Dataset, is the U.S. database that contains information on terrorist identities and includes not only known or suspected terrorists but also affiliates of watch-listed individuals.

The Department of Homeland Security’s FY 24 threat assessment warned that agents have encountered a growing number on the watch list and warned that ""terrorists and criminal actors may exploit the elevated flow and increasingly complex security environment to enter the United States.""
""Individuals with terrorism connections are interested in using established travel routes and permissive environments to facilitate access to the United States,"" the assessment also said.
Fox News reported earlier this month that thousands of ""special interest aliens"" from numerous countries, including the Middle East, have been arrested by Border Patrol agents while attempting to cross the U.S. southern border illegally over the last two years. 
HIGH MIGRANT NUMBERS BREAK MULTIPLE RECORDS IN NEW BLOW TO BIDEN BORDER STRATEGY
""Special interest aliens"" are people from countries identified by the U.S. government as having conditions that promote or protect terrorism or potentially pose some sort of national security threat to the U.S.
Since the terror attack against Israel, DHS has said the agency is ""closely monitoring unfolding events and will continue to engage in information sharing with our intelligence and law enforcement partners at home and abroad.""
HAWLEY PUSHES MAYORKAS ON ENCOUNTERS OF ‘SPECIAL INTEREST ALIENS’ INTO US AMID TERROR FEARS
""This information sharing helps ensure that we are positioned to help mitigate any risks to national security or public safety,"" a spokesperson said. ""Our multilayered border security efforts include various screening and vetting processes that work to detect and prevent individuals who pose national security or public safety risks from entering the United States.""
However, those assurances have failed to assuage Republicans, who have repeatedly claimed that the current state of the border poses a significant national security risk to the American people.

""Our wide-open Southwest border is a major national security threat,"" Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, said in response to the memo. ""Individuals on the terrorist watchlist are being caught crossing the Southwest border at alarming rates – 169 in FY23. And those are just the ones we've caught. 
""SECURE THE BORDER NOW,"" they said.

DeSantis defends move to kick out pro-Palestinian groups that support Hamas from state college campuses,2023-10-29,Fox News,['Stephen Sorace'],"GOP presidential candidate Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., joins 'Life, Liberty & Levin' to discuss growing tensions on American campuses in response to the Israel-Hamas war.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday said he stands by the decision to decertify any pro-Palestinian student groups that side with Hamas from state college campuses, arguing that to allow these groups to openly side with ""brutal terrorist organizations"" is like committing ""suicide as a country.""
DeSantis, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate, appeared on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" saying that the pro-Palestinian solidarity group had also claimed to be part of the Hamas movement.
""This is not cancel culture, this group, they themselves said in the aftermath of the Hamas attack that they don't just stand in solidarity, that they are part of this Hamas movement,"" he said. ""And so, yeah, you have a right to go out and demonstrate, but you can't provide material support to terrorism. They've linked themselves to Hamas, and so we absolutely decertified them.""
Last week, the chancellor of the state’s university system penned a letter stating that a student group present in at least two universities in the Florida system, known as National Students for Justice in Palestine (National SJP), published a ""toolkit"" that refers to the Hamas operation as ""the resistance"" and says that ""Palestinian students in exile are PART of this movement, not in solidarity with this movement.""

DeSantis said he believes the move is ""totally justified within the law,"" which states that it is a felony under Florida law to knowingly provide material aid or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. 
""Their own words are saying they're part of this organization, that they don't just stand in solidarity, that they don't just support what they did, but that this is their movement, too,"" DeSantis said. ""So once you hitch your wagon to a group like Hamas, that takes you out of the realm of normal activity, and that's something that we're going to take action against."" 
2024 REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES' SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL UNDER SCRUTINY BY IOWA EVANGELICALS
DeSantis further questioned whether allowing a group to openly side with a terrorist organization was healthy for the country.
""Are we just going to commit suicide as a country and let groups metastasize who are openly siding with brutal terrorist organizations?"" he asked. ""I don't think that's a recipe for a successful country. I want to have a country where we're protected from that stuff. So I think we made the right decision. I stand by it 100%.""

DeSantis has been a vocal proponent of cracking down on and condemning the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,400 Israelis. He recently said he would cancel student visas and deport foreign nationals who celebrate Hamas if he is elected president.

Bus company leaves pro-Israel supporters stranded en route to rally: ‘it’s obvious what happened here’,2023-12-06,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers remarks as the conflict with Hamas continues almost two months after the Oct. 7 attack.
A few hundred Jewish people on their way from Toronto to Ottawa for a protest were abandoned when over a dozen drivers did not show up, with protest organizers accusing the company responsible for driving the buses of antisemitism. 
""We were shocked that, of more than 70 buses UJA booked, 17 did not show up,"" United Jewish Appeal (UJA) president and CEO Adam Minsky said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Those 17 buses were the responsibility of a particular subcontracted company.""
""Despite charging in full in advance and confirming its participation, the company did not send a single bus and has declined all communications while refusing to provide any explanation,"" Minsky explained. 
""Given the absolute silence of the subcontractor and with no other explanation, we are driven to the view that this shameful decision is intended to disrupt our peaceful rally out of hatred toward Jews,"" he added, calling the act ""sickening and outrageous"" and promising to take legal action.

Some of the bus attendees suggested that police should investigate the incident as both a theft, due to the money spent on hiring the buses, and a possible hate crime. One attendee told the Toronto Sun that the situation ""smells"" because ""there were no weather issues,"" claiming that ""it’s obvious what happened here.""

Biden says Israel will stop fighting in Gaza when Hamas ‘no longer maintains the capacity to murder’,2023-11-16,Fox News,['Chris Pandolfo'],"President Joe Biden says it's a 'big mistake' for Israel to think it's going to 'occupy' and 'maintain' Gaza after its war against Hamas.
President Biden said Wednesday that he thinks Israel's military operation in Gaza will stop when Hamas ""no longer maintains the capacity to murder, abuse, and do horrific things to the Israelis.""
Speaking at a press conference after his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden called on the Israeli military to exercise caution as they pursue Hamas military targets near civilian infrastructure. He said the Israel Defense Forces has ""an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets.""
However, he added, ""Hamas said they plan to attack Israelis again and this is terrible dilemma.""

Biden and his administration have remained steadfast in support for Israel's ongoing war against Hamas. U.S. officials have strongly condemned the Oct. 7 terror attacks on Israel, in which Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Jewish state and massacred as many as 1,200 people, taking some 240 back to Gaza as hostages. 
Other world leaders have condemned Israel's military actions in Gaza, specifically attacks on hospitals and other civilian infrastructure, pointing to the staggering death toll figures released by the Hamas-led Gaza Health Ministry. Israel has said, and the White House confirmed, that Hamas uses Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza City, as a military base to store weapons and plan terrorist attacks.

The U.S. government has rejected calls for a cease-fire in the conflict, insisting that Israel has a right to defend itself. At the same time, the Biden administration has pressured Israel to allow short-term pauses in the fighting so humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, can be delivered to the Palestinians living in Gaza. 
The president acknowledged he did not know when the Israel-Hamas war would end. However, he made clear that, in his view, the only solution to the conflict is the formation of a Palestinian state.

Anti-Israel protesters disrupt Black Friday shopping to call for Palestinian uprising: ‘Intifada revolution’,2023-11-24,Fox News,['Brandon Gillespie'],"Pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, holding signs and chanting along the parade route. (Credit: FNTV)
Anti-Israel protesters rallied across the country Friday in an attempt to disrupt Black Friday shoppers, with some calling for a Palestinian uprising in the Middle East.
The protests took place in heavily trafficked areas across multiple cities, including New York City, Los Angeles and Boston despite the ongoing cease-fire between Israel and Hamas terrorists that saw an exchange of hostages being held in Gaza.
""There is only one solution: Intifada revolution!"" protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan's Washington Square Park chanted. Calls for an intifada, or civil uprising, have become increasingly common in anti-Israel protests since the brutal Oct.7 Hamas attack that saw more than 1,200 people murdered, including children and babies.

According to the New York Post, protesters called for those in attendance to rebel against Black Friday by boycotting companies and disrupting shoppers, as well as shouting antisemitic statements, such as, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.""
Multiple reports said the protest consisted of about 2,000 people, and that another 1,000-2,000 protesters also gathered near Macy's flagship store just 16 blocks north on 34th street.
Protesters in Los Angeles converged on The Grove, a popular shopping district just south of Hollywood, to, according to one report, ""make it clear that there will be no business as usual until Palestine is free."" Police monitored the protesters as they marched through the area and disrupted traffic.

In Boston, dozens of protesters gathered outside the Puma flagship store in a popular shopping area to criticize the company's ties to Israel, according to local NPR station WGBH. The outlet cited the company in stating that it provides Israel's national soccer teams with branded equipment for international competitions.

House GOP’s $14B Israel aid bill offset with cuts to IRS cash in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act,2023-10-30,Fox News,['Elizabeth Elkind'],"House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., reiterates Congress' support for Israel, his stance on antisemitism unfolding on college campuses, the upcoming budget deadline and other priorities for the 118th Congress.
House Republicans have rolled out a bill giving $14.3 billion in aid to Israel, while cutting into cash President Biden allocated toward the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) last year.
The 13-page bill released on Monday would completely offset the foreign aid by rescinding those funds from the Inflation Reduction Act passed last year. Specifically, it targets some of the $80 billion the package gave to the IRS.
It comes as Israel continues to fight a bloody war against terror group Hamas. Hamas militants attacked Israeli towns and villages earlier this month, killing most of the 1,400 casualties Israel has seen in the conflict so far. Thousands of Palestinians have also been killed.
Israel is shaping up to be the first big test for newly elected Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., whose first act on the House floor as leader was to pass a bipartisan resolution condemning Hamas. 
IRAN-LINKED TERRORISTS, GUERRILLAS SURROUND ISRAEL: HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THEM
Speaker Mike Johnson, right, is proposing to offset aid to Israel with cash from President Bidens, left, Inflation Reduction Act. 
He’s expected to hold a vote on the Israel aid bill on Thursday.
It will likely put Democrats in a tough spot between the political fallout of rejecting Israel aid and the bill’s removal of funds from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
And the bill puts Johnson at odds with the Democrat-controlled Senate and White House, both of which are pushing for Israel aid to be tied with dollars for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. 
However, the cuts to IRS funding is likely to please conservatives – Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told Hill Country Patriot Radio on Monday that he would support Israel aid if it was offset with budget cuts. 
""The American people must see that it's going to cost something if we're going to give another $14 billion to Israel. So I'm for it. But it should be paid for…with real money, not budgetary gimmicks,"" Roy said.

Earlier this month Biden asked Congress to approve a mammoth $106 billion supplemental funding request with $14.3 billion for Israel, more than $60 billion for Ukraine, just over $13 billion for U.S. border security and an additional $10 billion in humanitarian assistance. 
Johnson made clear he would not be putting the entire package together on the House floor, something a significant number of conservatives also opposed.
""We are going to move a standalone Israel funding bill this week in the House. I know our colleagues, our Republican colleagues in the Senate, have a similar measure,"" Johnson told ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
BIDEN ADMIN URGES MAJOR FUNDING INCREASES FOR AID TO UKRAINE, ISRAEL, AND GAZA CIVILIANS
""There are lots of things going on around the world that we have to address, and we will. But right now, what's happening in Israel takes the immediate attention. And I think we've got to separate that and get it through. I believe there will be bipartisan support for that, and I'm going to push very hard for it.""

Just two Republican lawmakers have come out against the Israel funding so far, GOP hardliner Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.
Last week a group of GOP senators led by Sens. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced a bill in the Senate to strip the $14.3 billion in Israel funding from Biden’s request to move it on its own.

Hundreds killed in blast at Gaza Strip hospital; Israel says Islamic Jihad’s ‘failed rocket launch’ to blame,2023-10-17,Fox News,"['Greg Wehner', 'Trey Yingst']","FOX News correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on the reports of a deadly strike at a Gaza hospital on ""The Story.""
A Hamas-run hospital that was treating wounded Palestinians and sheltering many others in the Gaza Strip was hit by an airstrike Tuesday, killing hundreds of people, though Israel Defense Forces (IDF) blame the strike on the Islamic Jihad.
The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 500 people were killed at al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, which Hamas said was the result of an Israeli airstrike.
When asked earlier in the day, the IDF said it was investigating the source of the explosion, noting that the hospital is a ""highly sensitive building"" and is ""not an IDF target.""

After an investigation, the IDF provided its findings with regard to the source of the airstrike.
""An analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the al-Ahli [Baptist] hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,"" IDF officials said. ""Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza.""
Shortly after the strike, a senior Hamas official told Fox, ""After the barbaric attack, it’s too early to talk about this.""

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., accused Israel of conducting a strike on the hospital in a post she wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
""Israel just bombed the Baptist Hospital killing 500 Palestinians (doctors, children, patients) just like that,"" Tlaib tweeted on Tuesday. ""[President Biden] this is what happens when you refuse to facilitate a ceasefire [and] help de-escalate.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tripled down on the Hamas narrative that Israel was behind last week's explosion at a Gaza hospital, something that had already been debunked by both Israeli and U.S. intelligence. 
""Media outlets and third-party analysts have raised doubts about claims and evidence offered by both Israel and the Gaza Ministry of Health, and I agree with the United Nations that an independent investigation is necessary,"" Tlaib told Haaretz on Monday. ""I cannot uncritically accept Israel’s denials of responsibility as fact, especially in light of confirmation from the World Health Organization that Israel has bombed numerous medical facilities in Gaza and reports from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society of ongoing threats from the Israeli military to evacuate hospital.""
She continued, ""Both the Israeli and United States governments have long, documented histories of misleading the public about wars and war crimes - like last year’s Israeli military assassination of Shireen Abu Akleh and the false claims of weapons of mass destruction that led our country into the Iraq War - and cannot clear themselves of responsibility without an independent international investigation. This debate should not distract us from the urgent need for a ceasefire to save innocent civilian lives.""

""Israel just bombed the Baptist killing 500 Palestinians (doctors, children, patients) just like that,"" Tlaib wrote on X.

'THE VIEW' CO-HOST CALLS OUT 'SQUAD' DEMOCRATS FOR ACCUSING ISRAEL OF ATTACK ON GAZA HOSPITAL: 'SHAME' ON THEM
Initial reports were solely reliant on a statement from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. However, evidence emerged that the origin of the explosion was from a misfired rocket within Gaza aimed at Israel from Hamas ally Islamic Jihad. 
It was also revealed that the explosion mostly occurred in the parking lot of the hospital and that the death toll is estimated to be a small fraction of what Hamas first alleged.

Tlaib's post, which was never deleted from X, was slapped with Community Notes that read, ""AP’s analysis shows that the rocket that broke up in the air was fired from within Palestinian territory, and that the hospital explosion was most likely caused when part of that rocket crashed to the ground.""
The ""Squad"" lawmaker continued pushing the Hamas narrative at a pro-Palestinian protest outside Capitol Hill last week despite it having already been debunked by both the Biden administration and the IDF.
""People think it's ok to bomb a hospital with children,"" Tlaib told the crowd Wednesday.

On Monday, The New York Times published an editor's note admitting it relied ""too heavily"" on Hamas' claims after the paper was widely-panned for pushing the false narrative.
""Early versions of the coverage — and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert and social media channels — relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified. The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was,"" the Times acknowledged. ""Given the sensitive nature of the news during a widening conflict, and the prominent promotion it received, Times editors should have taken more care with the initial presentation, and been more explicit about what information could be verified. Newsroom leaders continue to examine procedures around the biggest breaking news events — including for the use of the largest headlines in the digital report — to determine what additional safeguards may be warranted.""

A group of Israeli hostages told government officials about the physical and sexual abuse they endured in captivity in Gaza.
According to Haaretz, the hostages told Netanyahu's cabinet about being beaten and degraded by their Hamas captors.
""They touch girls, and everyone knows it,"" a female hostage said. ""I won't recount details, but we had a procedure that no one moves without someone guarding them.""
""Medications ran out, and they gave us the wrong drugs,"" she added.
Another ex-hostage told Israeli officials that male captives lived in worse conditions than female hostages.


Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari issued an ""urgent call for action"" Wednesday morning where he stated the rescue of the 138 hostages in Hamas' captivity in Gaza remains a ""critical mission.""

""I can say with absolute certainty, every minute in Hamas captivity endangers their lives. This is an urgent call for action. The international community must take action, the Red Cross must have access to the hostages that are in the hands of Hamas,"" he said, reminding listeners that the hostages include women, children and the elderly.


Hagari added that some of the hostages have been injured since they were taken captive, and some have been harmed during the more than 60 days they have been in captivity.
""The Israel Defense Forces will do everything in its power to rescue our hostages and bring them home. We call others to do the same,"" he concluded.


The Israeli Air Force struck approximately 250 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip in the past day, the Israel Defense Forces said.
In addition to the IAF strikes, the IDF said troops on the ground are still locating weapons, tunnels, explosives and additional military infrastructure in Gaza. Troops are also directing fighter jets to strike terror targets once found.
""We also know they're targeting launching sites responsible for a number of rocket barrages that took place as recently as yesterday targeting Israel's second largest city of Tel Aviv,"" Fox News' Trey Yingst said from southern Israel Wednesday.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has canceled the annual Christmas tree lighting at the capitol in favor of a virtual event amid planned pro-Palestinian protests, according to a report.
Wednesday's 92nd Annual California State Capitol Tree Lighting was initially expected to be an in-person event in Sacramento, but an announcement by the governor's office stated that a pre-recorded virtual ceremony will be released on Wednesday at 6 p.m.

A spokesperson for Newsom told local outlet KCRA that nationwide protests were a factor in the decision to hold the event virtually.
""As we continue to see protests across the country impacting the safety of events of all scales — and for the safety and security of all participating members and guests including children and families — the ceremony this year will be virtual,"" the spokesperson said. ""The program is unchanged and viewers can tune in Wednesday evening to watch this year’s festivities.""
The Sacramento Regional Coalition for Palestinian Rights, and several other organizations, planned to protest at the event, in efforts to ""out Gov. Gavin Newsom
 for hiding from the public because he doesn't want to face their anger at his shameful stance in regard to the genocide in Gaza.""

Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., issued a statement about Hamas' sex crimes against Israeli women after being criticized by her own party over comments she made about the subject.
""I said it's horrific, and I think that rape is horrific. Sexual assault is horrific. I think that it happens in war situations. Terrorist organizations like Hamas, obviously are using these as tools,"" Jayapal had said on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" ""However, I think we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians – 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, three-quarters of whom are women and children.""
In a statement released Tuesday, Jayapal said that she ""unequivocally condemn[s]"" Hamas terrorists for using ""rape and sexual violence as an act of war.""

""I understand that I have critics who disagree with me on policy, but for them to insinuate that I would think, say or act in any way that equivocates on rape is outrageous and completely inconsistent with my record and life's work,"" Jayapal's statement read. ""It also deeply hurts the ability to have meaningful conversations about critical issues.""
""The pain that Israelis and Palestinians are feeling today is raw and very present,"" she added.

""Someone who did not condemn Hamas for the brutal massacre of 1,200 Israelis, for the kidnapping of babies and the elderly and for the horrific acts of abuse and rape, and for using the residents of Gaza as human shields, but instead condemns Israel, a democratic country that protects its citizens, cannot serve in the UN and cannot enter Israel!"" he added.

""And I tell the families and the few hostages that arrived after being released: we are fully dedicated to bringing back all the hostages, with no exception,"" Gallant continued.

University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill was under pressure during a House antisemitism hearing on Tuesday, as Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., noted that a Penn professor who called for ""intifada"" against Israel kept his job at the prestigious institution and other antisemitic speakers have been allowed to have events on campus. 
Banks, in turn, noted how former President Trump's director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Thomas Homan, was prevented from speaking on campus amid anti-Trump student protests, as was India's now-Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amy Wax, a tenured law professor who opposes the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, agenda. 

""Just weeks before the Oct. 7 terror attacks against Israel, Penn hosted a Palestine Writes Literature Festival,"" Banks said. ""The event featured Marc Lamont Hill, who was fired by CNN for calling for the destruction of Israel. It also hosted and included a member of the Palestinian Youth Movement, which has collaborated with the terrorists and maybe most notably, Roger Waters, the really wacky former Pink Floyd vocalist. The same Roger Waters, by the way, who's publicly used anti-Jewish slurs, desecrated the memory of Anne Frank and has dressed up as a Nazi and floated a pig balloon with a star of David – at many of his concerts. Why in the world would you host someone like that on your college campus to speak at the so-called Palestinian Rights Literature Festival?""

She should be listening to members of her party like Senator Gillibrand, who understands that this is a crime. These are war crimes. What is happening to these women is a crime. What Hamas is doing is barbaric. It is indecent. And what we know, if you want to make certain that the Palestinian people, the women are protected, you got to get rid of Hamas. Same goes if you want to protect Israeli women and children. Get rid of Hamas. These terrorist organizations are barbaric, act like animals, and there is no human decency that they are exercising.

The screening, which marked the first time the graphic footage was shown at an American university, took place at Harvard University.
At the event, the ambassador grilled Harvard University's administration for allegedly not being supportive enough of Jewish students during the war.

“This bastion of higher education and leadership is supposed to set the bar of decency and morality as high as it can go, yet following October 7th, it has become clear that regarding Israel’s war against pure evil, Harvard’s moral bar is nonexistent,"" Erdan argued. ""For a school that puts ‘veritas’ – truth – above all, this is particularly shameful.""
""From the university’s initial silence following the attack, to extended silence following the pro- terror voices, and to the shameful response to the assault of Jewish students, Harvard has become dangerous for Jews,"" the ambassador added.
Erdan also promised that the viewing would have a profound effect on the audience and said that,"" “Once you see this footage, it will change the way you view the Middle East.""


On Tuesday, the ""Outnumbered"" panel discussed recent reports of ""gruesome"" sex crimes committed by Hamas terrorists during the Israel-Hamas war.
""We are getting new, horrifying reports of what Hamas terrorists have done to Israeli women during their final moments on October 7th,"" co-host Emily Compagno explained. ""Gruesome accounts of sexual assault and rape from eyewitnesses with the details too graphic for us to even describe on air.""
""And while Hamas has released some of the female hostages, Israeli officials believe that at least 18 others are still being held by the terror group,"" she added.

Co-host Morgan Ortagus blasted U.N. Women for not condemning the sexual assaults quickly enough.
""You would think that U.N. Women would be for women,"" Ortagus said. ""It took them two months, Two months. They issued a statement on December 2nd in order to condemn using rape as a weapon of war the way that Hamas used it against Israeli women.""

Israel Defense Forces
 (IDF) spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said in a briefing on Tuesday that the Israeli military is continuing to target Hamas terrorists in underground tunnels, which he called ""unprecedented.""
""So far, we have located over 800 tunnel shafts and destroyed 500 of these,"" Hecht explained. ""The level of fortification is unprecedented.""
""While we've been operating, we are ensuring that there is minimum harm to civilians with soldiers on the ground going from building to building,"" the spokesman added.
Hecht added that he spent the last two days in a ""harm mitigation cell"" and described what he learned.
""We've been making a game with everything we have in our capabilities, every effort we can to facilitate the movement of civilians in the south in order to mitigate civilian casualties,"" he added. ""Our best efforts and minds are focused on understanding the human terrain in Gaza.""

Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu issued a blistering critique of women's rights organizations on Tuesday, accusing them of ignoring sex crimes committed by Hamas terrorists.

During a presser, Netanyahu referenced the ""sexual torture"" and ""unbelievable rapes"" that officials have determined Hamas terrorists perpetrated against Israeli women.
""I didn’t hear the civil rights organizations, people in the UN, I didn’t hear the outcry, where are you?"" Netanyahu said in Hebrew. ""You were quiet because we’re talking about Jewish women?
""I have to say this, in a language that everyone understands,"" he continued before switching to English.
""I say to the women’s rights organizations to the human rights organizations, you’ve heard of the rape of Israeli women, horrible atrocities, sexual mutilation - where the hell are you?"" the prime minister added. ""I expect all civilized leaders, governments, nations to speak up against this atrocity.""

Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder said on Tuesday that the Department of Defense is in contact with its Israeli counterparts on a ""near daily basis.""
Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin actively discusses how the U.S. can assist Israel's security amid the war, Ryder said.
""I'm not going to get into the specifics other than to say, again, we consult closely with Israel Secretary Austin speaks his counterpart on a near daily basis,"" Ryder explained.

""And part of those discussions includes the kind of security assistance Israel needs to prevent a future terrorist attack in the future,"" he added.


Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., laced into Harvard University President Dr. Claudine Gay during a House committee hearing on the rise of antisemitism on college campuses on Tuesday, challenging that the Ivy League school's leader answer for students chanting for violence against Israel.

""Harvard students calling for the mass murder of African-Americans is not protected free speech at Harvard, correct?"" Stefanik asked, leading to her point.
The New York Republican demanded that Gay respond to the ""yes or no question,"" before asking the Harvard president if she was familiar with the term ""intifada."" Stefanik cited multiple instances of Harvard students chanting, ""There is only one solution. Intifada, Revolution,"" and, ""globalize the intifada,"" since Hamas' October 7 massacre and Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza that followed.

The State Department announced Tuesday that it is implementing a new visa restriction policy following ""unprecedented levels of violence"" in the West Bank ""by Israeli extremist settlers targeting Palestinians and their property, displacing entire communities, as well as violence by Palestinian extremist militants against Israeli civilians.

Spokesman Matthew Miller said during a briefing that ""Violence in the West Bank this year is at levels not seen since the second Intifada"" and ""in recent weeks, an alarming surge in violent acts has driven this unwelcome record even higher.""
""Today, as President Biden recently warned, the United States is taking action to address this escalating violence in the West Bank
 by implementing a new visa restriction policy under Section 212 A3C of the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" he said. ""Under this policy, the United States will pursue visa restrictions against individuals involved in or meaningfully contributing to the undermining of peace security or stability in the West Bank. This includes acts of violence against persons or property, as well as undue restrictions on civilians, access to essential services and basic necessities.""
Miller continued by saying that ""Immediate family members of such persons may also be subject to these restrictions"" and ""The department is pursuing initial action against individuals pursuant to this visa restriction policy, today.""
""We unequivocally condemn attacks by violent Israeli extremists against Palestinians and those by violent Palestinian extremists against Israelis,"" he added.


EXCLUSIVE: A top conservative group affiliated with the Heritage Foundation is pushing Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to keep President Biden’s $106 billion supplemental aid request from coming to the House floor. 

""Please do not undermine the gains that have been made on behalf of the American people by substituting one corrupt, unaffordable end-of-year deal for another. Hold firm to the convictions you and I and the American people share in common,"" Heritage Action President Dr. Kevin Roberts wrote to Johnson.
He was particularly critical of the roughly $61 billion requested for Ukraine, a topic that has become a lightning rod within the GOP.
The package would include funding for Israel, Ukraine, the U.S. border, and humanitarian efforts, among other items. Republicans in both the House and Senate have warned that such a package would fail on its own.


FBI Director Christopher Wray testified Tuesday that the terror threat facing the United States has reached unprecedented levels since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Wray to describe the current ""threat matrix"" facing the United States at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
""What I would say that is unique about the environment that we're in right now in my career is that while there may have been times over the years where individual threats could have been higher here or there than where they may be right now, I've never seen a time where all the threats or so many of the threats are all elevated, all at exactly the same time,"" the FBI director replied. 
""So, blinking red lights analogy about 9/11 — all the lights were blinking red before 9/11, apparently,"" Graham continued. ""Obviously, all of us missed it. Would you say there's multiple blinking red lights out there?"" he asked. 

""I see blinking red lights everywhere,"" Wray answered. 


The presidents of Harvard, MIT and UPenn are being confronted Tuesday during a House committee hearing dedicated to confronting the surge in antisemitism seen on American college campuses in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, as Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., pressed the trio about the ""race-based ideology of the radical left"" she said their institutions are supporting. 
In her opening statement, Foxx, chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, held a moment of silence ""to recognize all the Israelis and others who have been killed, injured, or taken hostage by Hamas terrorists."" 

Addressing the witnesses, Harvard University President Dr. Claudine Gay, University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Dr. Sally Kornbluth, Foxx said that ""each of you will have a chance to answer to and atone for the many specific instances of vitriolic, hate-filled antisemitism on your respective campuses that have denied students the safe learning environment they are due."" 
""As you confront our questions in this hearing, remember that you are not speaking to us, but to the students on your campus who have been threatened and assaulted and who look to you to protect them,"" Foxx said. ""
Foxx played a video of many pro-Palestinian
 protesters at college campuses shouting ""intifada,"" an Arabic word for uprising that is used to describe past Palestinian campaigns against Israel.

Images have emerged Tuesday of a damaged residential building in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon following a strike by a rocket that was fired from the Gaza Strip.
Two women in their 60s were injured in the blast, according to The Jerusalem Post.
The Israel Defense Forces also said Tuesday that sirens were activated in Tel Aviv and northern Israel, warning of potential rocket strikes.
The Lebanese Army wrote on X Tuesday that shelling from the Israeli military has killed one of its soldiers, in what is being reported as the first death of a Lebanese soldier in the Israel-Hamas war.
Israel has been engaging in back-and-forth border skirmishes against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah since the beginning of the war.

The Lebanese Army wrote that an ""army military center in the Nabi Aweida -- Al-Adaysah area was bombed by the Israeli enemy, which led to the martyrdom of a soldier and the injury of 3 others, who were transferred to a hospital for treatment.""

The leader of Qatar – which has played a key role in negotiating a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas – has accused Israel on Tuesday of committing “crimes of genocide” in Gaza. 
Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said in Doha Tuesday that “all religious, ethical and humanitarian values have been violated in occupied Palestine through crimes the occupation forces are committing against humanity,” according to the Associated Press. 

He added that self-defense “doesn’t permit the crimes of genocide that Israel is committing.” 
Israel and the U.S. say the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas has been using civilians as human shields in the Gaza Strip, which is adding to the death toll there. 
As of Tuesday, more than 15,000 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s campaign to eliminate Hamas, the AP reported, citing a military official. 
Hamas began the war on Oct. 7 by launching a surprise attack on Israel and has refused calls to release more hostages. 
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

An Israel Defense Forces commander said Tuesday that Israel’s military is currently “in the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation -- in terms of terrorists killed, the number of firefights, and the use of firepower from the land and air.” 
Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, who leads the Southern Command, said in a statement that “We are in the heart of Jabalya, in the heart of Shuja'iyya, and now also in the heart of Khan Younis.” 
“We intend to continue to strike and secure our accomplishments,” he added. 

The IDF also said since the end of a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas last week, “Israeli Air Force aircraft have carried out two rounds of strikes involving dozens of aircraft from all the combat squadrons.  
“Hundreds of munitions were utilized during strikes on tunnels, operational shafts, and anti-tank missile launch positions in order to support the movement of IDF infantry soldiers on the ground,” it added. 
Fox News' Ben Evansky contributed to this report.
The State Department says the U.S. suspects one reason Hamas is refusing to release its remaining female hostages is to prevent them from revealing the horrors they experienced in captivity.
State Department spokesman Matthew Miller says that Hamas' refusal to release the women led to the collapse of the cease-fire on Friday.

""It seems that one of the reasons they don't want to turn women over that they've been holding hostage — and the reason this pause fell apart — is that they don't want these women to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in custody,"" Miller said during a Monday press briefing.
The statement comes amid heightened tensions regarding Hamas' brutal treatment of women during and after its Oct. 7 massacre. Israel has documented extensive instances of rape and sexual assault and has called on the United Nations to take action.

The hostages who have been freed by Hamas from the Gaza Strip were given tranquilizer pills before being transferred to Israel in a bid to make them appear happier following their treatment in captivity, a report says. 
Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, the head of the Ministry of Health’s medical division, told the Israeli government about the alleged druggings on Tuesday, according to The Times of Israel. 
The newspaper reports that Mizrahi named the drug Clonazepam, which is known outside of Israel as Klonopin and Rivotril. 
The National Institutes of Health describes Clonazepam as being “used to relieve panic attacks,” amongst other purposes. 

The hostages, who spent more than 50 days in captivity, were first handed over to the International Red Cross before being transferred to Israel. 
The Israel Defense Forces say sirens are sounding in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, warning of incoming rocket fire.

Meanwhile, a building in the city of Ashkelon has been hit Tuesday with a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza, the Jerusalem Post is reporting, citing Israeli media.
A woman in her 60s reportedly was among the wounded in that incident.

The families of hostages still being held by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip say they will meet Tuesday with 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
The families have sought to meet with Netanyahu and his wartime Cabinet since a truce deal between Israel and Hamas that saw the release of 105 hostages expired last Friday, according to The Associated Press. 
The families say they want to hear from Netanyahu that he has their relatives’ fate in mind as Israel moves ahead in its war against Hamas. 
Israel said this morning that 137 hostages are believed to remain in Gaza, including 17 women and children. 
The Associated Press contributed to this report. 
Turkey’s state-run news agency reported Tuesday that the country's intelligence officials have warned their Israeli counterparts of “serious consequences” if they attempt to target Hamas members on its territory. 
The warning comes after the leader of Israel's domestic security agency, Shin Bet, said his organization is prepared to destroy Hamas “in every place.""
“In every place, in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Turkey, in Qatar, everywhere,” Ronen Bar said in comments aired Sunday night by Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11, according to the Associated Press. “It’ll take a few years but we will be there to do it.”
The Anadolu Agency, quoting unnamed Turkish intelligence officials, said “necessary warnings were made” to Israeli officials who were told their actions would “have serious consequences.”

Israel's military said Tuesday that 137 hostages remain held by Hamas terrorists inside the Gaza Strip.
""We have a moral obligation to continue to do everything to bring everyone home,"" the Israel Defense Forces wrote on X.
Seventeen of those hostages are women and children, according to the IDF.
White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on ‘Fox News Sunday’ that the U.S. believes around 9 Americans are among the hostages still in captivity.

Yesterday, Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Fox News that “we have to fear” for the safety of those Americans, adding that ""I can't be confident that anyone is alive, unfortunately.” 
The Israeli Air Force
 said Tuesday that its fighter jets have attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanon following a series of launches that entered its territory. 
""A short time ago, fighter jets of the Air Force attacked a series of targets of the terrorist organization Hezbollah in Lebanese territory. Among the targets attacked: terrorist infrastructures, positions and military sites where weapons were stored and from which terrorists of the terrorist organization operated,"" it said in a post on X.
""In addition, earlier today several launches were identified that crossed the territory of Lebanon towards various areas in the north of the country and fell in open areas,"" the Israeli Air Force added.

Israel is considering a plan to pump seawater into the extensive tunnel system underneath the Gaza Strip to drive Hamas militants out of their hiding places, a report says. 

Israel’s military last month finished installing at least five large seawater pumps – which can draw water from the Mediterranean Sea -- near the coastal Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, according to The Wall Street Journal. 
American officials told the newspaper that Israel first informed the U.S. of the plan in early November, drawing a mixed reaction as there are concerns about how pumping seawater may damage the environment. 
“We are not sure how successful pumping will be since nobody knows the details of the tunnels and the ground around them,” one source told The Wall Street Journal. “It’s impossible to know if that will be effective because we don’t know how seawater will drain in tunnels no one has been in before.” 

Jon Alterman, senior vice president at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, also said “It’s hard to tell what pumping seawater will do to the existing water and sewage infrastructure. It is hard to tell what it will do to groundwater reserves. And it’s hard to tell the impact on the stability of nearby buildings.”

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized Hamas supporters on Monday for overlooking the terrorist group's sex crimes against Israeli women.
Speaking at a United Nations meeting via remote video, Clinton called it ""outrageous"" to ignore the reports of sexual assaults.
""Organizations, governments and individuals who are committed to a better future for women and girls have a responsibility to condemn all violence against women,"" Clinton said. ""It is outrageous just that some who claim to stand for justice are closing their eyes and their hearts to the victims of Hamas.""

The former U.S. official noted that ""women on both sides of the current conflict in the Middle East have long worked for a just and lasting peace.""
""I have grieved with Israeli women who have lost loved ones to terrorist attacks, but refuse to believe that peace is impossible,"" Clinton continued. ""I have talked and listened to Palestinian women who have suffered greatly from the conflicts of the past decades, yet dream of a peaceful future and a state of their own.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused Monday to condemn comments from a top progressive lawmaker who called for ""balance"" when condemning Hamas' use of sexual violence against Israeli women.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said ""we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinian"" when asked specifically about mass rape committed by Palestinian militants, during an interview Sunday with CNN. When asked about Jayapal's comments, Jean-Pierre reiterated that using rape as a weapon of war was ""reprehensible,"" but stopped short of condemning the congresswoman.
""I can only speak for the president — that's who I can speak for,"" Jean-Pierre told Fox News correspondent Jacqui Heinrich during the daily White House press briefing Monday. ""We've been clear that what Hamas did is absolutely reprehensible, full stop. We're going to continue to be clear about that.""
""We think rape and the use of rape — being used as a weapon — that is also reprehensible and that's full stop and I'll just leave it there,"" she continued. ""That's speaking for the president of the United States and I think I've been very clear on that.""
After Jean-Pierre was pressed about Jayapal's comments in particular, she again declined to address the congresswoman's remarks directly.
""I just commented on it. I just laid out what we believe is unacceptable,"" she added.

House votes to censure Rashida Tlaib over anti-Israel comments,2023-11-07,Fox News,['Elizabeth Elkind'],"FOX News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on Democrats' response to 'Squad' member Rashida Tlaib's anti-Israel remarks ahead of a censure vote on 'Special Report.'
The House of Representatives has voted to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., in a 234 - 188 vote on Tuesday night. 
The punishment, while largely symbolic, was a formal public rebuke of her most recent anti-Israel comments made in the wake of the Jewish nation’s war against terror group Hamas. 
Twenty-two Democrats voted with 212 Republicans to censure Tlaib. Four GOP lawmakers voted against the measure. Four lawmakers voted present. The measure was introduced by freshman Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., on Monday.

""If this is not worthy of censure, what is? When you can call for the annihilation of a country and its people, if that’s not worthy of a censure, what is?"" McCormick said on the House floor Tuesday. 
In the text of his resolution, the Georgia Republican accused Tlaib of ""promoting false narratives regarding the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.""
TLAIB SAYS GOP ‘DISTORTING’ HER POSITION ON ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR WITH CENSURE RESOLUTIONS: ‘OBVIOUS LIES’
Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, has come under bipartisan criticism after sharing a video on social platform X that included the phrase ""From the river to the sea,"" a pro-Palestinian liberation slogan.

Her critics have pointed out that the rallying cry implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel as a state. Hamas has also co-opted the phrase.
""It is fundamentally a call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, territory that includes the State of Israel, which would mean the dismantling of the Jewish state,"" the Anti-Defamation League’s website says. ""It is an antisemitic charge denying the Jewish right to self-determination, including through the removal of Jews from their ancestral homeland.""
TLAIB ACCUSES BIDEN OF SUPPORTING ‘GENOCIDE’ OF PALESTINIANS, WARNS: ‘WE WILL REMEMBER IN 2024’
Tlaib has remained unrepentant over her use of the phrase. 
""It is important to separate people and governments,"" she said on the House floor earlier in the day. ""The idea that criticizing the Israeli government is antisemitic sets a dangerous precedent.""

The House voted to advance McCormick’s resolution earlier on Tuesday, when a vote to kill the measure was defeated 208 to 213, with one lawmaker voting ""present."" 
A resolution to censure Tlaib, brought by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., failed to advance to a vote last week.

Anti-Israel protesters interrupt Jewish students testifying before Congress on college antisemitism,2023-11-08,Fox News,['Danielle Wallace'],"Pro-Palestine demonstrators disrupted a House Judiciary hearing on addressing the rise of antisemitism and anti-conservative bias on college campuses, chanting ""Free Gaza,"" ""cease-fire now"" and other demands before being escorted out by police.
Anti-Israel protesters interrupted Jewish students and other witnesses testifying before Congress about the rise of antisemitism and anti-conservative bias on college campuses Wednesday.
Right as Connor Ogrydziak, recent graduate of the University of Buffalo, began his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee hearing slated to discuss ""freedom of speech on college campuses,"" a protester stood up in the gallery with sign saying pro Palestine does not equal antisemitism. ""Silencing anti-Zionist Jewish and Arab students is not about battling antisemitism,"" the protester shouted, as Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, gaveled for the committee to remain in order. 
Accusing politicians of ""genocide,"" the protester cited the estimated 10,000 people Hamas claims have died in Gaza. Police officers escorted the protester out, while another demonstrator began shouting about the censure of far-left Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, over her use of the antisemitic chant ""from the river to the sea"" that promises to erase Israel from the map. Jordan promised those who interrupted the hearing would be ousted, as more demonstrators, donning red hands, accused Israel of ""apartheid."" 
""Cease-fire, now. Cease-fire, now,"" a protester shouted while being removed by police. 
Later during a line of questioning, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California., said ""the protesters who have all been escorted out probably don't understand, but they are playing into the hands of Iran.""

""We need to fully fund investigations into the funding that goes to anti-Semitism into a pattern that we see here today. I want to say to all of you who are both young Americans for Freedom and non YAF members, thank you for standing up to be conservatives on campus and taking it.""

Ogrydziak, who has faced threats and protests from fellow students over speakers like Lt. Cornell West and conservative commentator Michael Knowles who his organization Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) invited to speak on Buffalo University’s campus, attempted to begin again several times while protesters shouted ""Free Gaza,"" ""Free Palestine,"" and ""Palestinians deserve to speak about the genocide of their families.""  Police warned the demonstrators to sit down or they would be arrested. 
""Palestinian students should not be censured. You want to talk about putting money where your mouth is? There are 10,000, over 10,000 Gazans dead,"" another demonstrator shouted.

Demonstrators continued to interrupt other witnesses and be escorted out of the hearing, which Jordan opened the hearing by citing the Anti-Defamation League has tracked a 400% increase in Anti-Semitic incidents, including harassment, vandalism and assault, in the two weeks after Hamas terrorists’ Oct. 7 attack on Israeli citizens. 
Ranking member Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., also cited how in the year prior to the October 7 assault, the ADL also recorded antisemitic activity rising by 41%. Nadler apologized directly to one of the witnesses, Cornell student Amanda Silberstein, after law enforcement at the Ivy League school in New York arrested a student for allegedly making violent threats against Jews on an Internal message board, including to shoot, slit the throats of and rape Jewish students on campus.

""And I am sorry for the fear they have caused you and your fellow students. It is unacceptable. We must do better. There is no excuse for that kind of violence at any school against any student. And then academic discussion about the First Amendment is mostly beside the point until we can secure these campuses.""

Anti-Israel statements sweep more colleges; critics slam leaders for staying out of fray,2023-10-11,Fox News,['Brianna Herlihy'],"FOX News' Greg Palkot reports on intensifying fighting between Israel and Hamas. 
Elite U.S. universities are getting sharp criticism in response to statements by anti-Israel campus groups that have gone unchecked by campus leaders.
On Sunday, a day after Hamas terrorist attacks on Israelis killed over 1,000, including children, and wounded over 2,000, nearly 30 ""Palestine solidarity groups"" at Harvard University issued a statement saying ""the apartheid regime"" of Israel ""is the only one to blame"" for the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists. 
""Today's events did not occur in a vacuum,"" the statement said. ""In the coming days, Palestinians will be forced to bear the full brunt of Israel's violence."" 
Roughly 24 hours later, on Monday, Harvard University President Claudine Gay released a statement, saying, ""Let there be no doubt that I condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas.""

She added that while students have the right to speak for themselves, ""no student group — not even 30 student groups — speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.""
But Lawrence H. Summers, president emeritus of Harvard, says the school’s ""delayed statement fails to meet the needs of the moment."" 
""Why can’t we find anything approaching the moral clarity of Harvard statements after George Floyd's death or Russia's invasion of Ukraine when terrorists kill, rape and take hostage hundreds of Israelis attending a music festival?"" Summers, who served in senior leadership posts under presidents Clinton and Obama, asked in a post Tuesday on X, formerly Twitter.
""Why can’t we give reassurance that the University stands squarely against Hamas terror to frightened students when 35 groups of their fellow students appear to be blaming all the violence on Israel?"" 
DEMOCRAT BLASTS 'SQUAD' MEMBERS OVER CALLS TO END ISRAEL ASSISTANCE: 'IT SICKENS ME'
Prior to Gay releasing her statement, Summers said he had never felt so ""disillusioned and alienated"" during his 50-year affiliation with the university.
The former Clinton Treasury secretary compared the school administration’s silence on the attacks in Israel to Gay’s nearly 500-word ""powerful"" statement condemning police violence when George Floyd was killed in 2020.

In the more than 48-hour window before Gay published her statement, Summers said Harvard was ""being defined by the morally unconscionable statement apparently coming from two dozen student groups blaming all the violence on Israel.""
Northwestern University Students for Justice in Palestine issued a similar statement on Monday, saying Israel is not ""the aggrieved party."" 
PROGRESSIVE DEM SLAMS ‘REPREHENSIBLE AND REPULSIVE' RESPONSE TO HAMAS ATTACK ON ISRAEL AFTER ’SQUAD' REMARKS
""The events of October 7th are more than just isolated incidents; they're symptomatic of decades-long desperation stemming from subjugation and systemic oppression,"" the statement said.
""Israel's portrayal as the aggrieved party is not only historically inaccurate, but also contradicts the very dynamics they've established.

Sen Blackburn calls for investigation into allegation controversial UN agency employee kept Israeli hostage,2023-12-04,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"FOX News contributor Tomi Lahren discusses the response from the UN Women deputy executive director about condemning Hamas on 'The Story.'
EXCLUSIVE - Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., demanded an investigation into allegations that a controversial United Nations agency's employee detained one of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. 
""The United States will not be complicit in propping up Hamas' terrorism, and this report further proves why deep change is necessary within UNRWA before we even consider providing another dollar to the agency,"" Blackburn wrote in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital and addressed to U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield and United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. 
""It is deeply concerning that, despite the prevalence of these reports, the United Nations has seemingly done nothing to investigate or prevent the siphoning of UNRWA funding by terrorists, and UNRWA continues to double down on its claims that each subsequent, documented report is ‘unsubstantiated.’""
Blackburn has requested a response by Dec. 18 that addresses a report from Israeli reporter Almog Boker about a UNRWA employee who allegedly detained a hostage in their house for 50 days and details of any investigation into the report, as well as an explanation of UNRWA's ""process for ensuring its facilities are not used to support terrorist activities,"" among other points. 
UN ACCOUNT HIT FOR EXPLICITLY CONDEMNING HAMAS' ATTACK ON ISRAEL EIGHT WEEKS LATER: ‘TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH’
Boker, a journalist with Israeli Channel 13, last week claimed on social media platform X that he had interviewed a recently released hostage who told him a UNRWA teacher held them hostage. He additionally claimed a Gazan doctor – allegedly a pediatrician – helped hold another hostage captive for Hamas.

""One of the abductees, held for nearly 50 days in an attic, reveals he was held by a [UNRWA] teacher – a father of ten children,"" Boker wrote. ""This teacher locked the victim away, barely provided food, and neglected medical needs … These are not isolated incidents; these civilians are terrorists,"" Boker wrote. ""Present at the Saturday massacre, they're now revealed as integral to holding hundreds captive, including women and children.""
UNRWA pushed back on the claim, calling it ""unsubstantiated"" after Boker did not immediately respond to their requests for additional information, saying in an official statement, ""UNRWA and other entities in the United Nations have asked the journalist to provide more information on what we consider to be a very serious allegation. Despite repeated demands, the journalist has not responded.""
US WARSHIP, MULTIPLE COMMERCIAL VESSELS REPORTEDLY ATTACKED IN RED SEA
The UNRWA has faced several allegations, including corruption and directly helping Hamas, as documented in an X community note. Reuters reported on a former headmaster at a UNRWA school who helped build rockets for Islamic Jihad while employed by the agency, as well as posts from several UNRWA teachers and administrators celebrating the Oct. 7 attack.
The agency urged the journalist to provide ""immediate clarification"" on the claims and that ""in the absence of credible information to support this claim, UNRWA requests the journalist immediately delete the post.""

Boker followed up with a post on X after UNRWA’s statement, slamming the agency for choosing ""to attack the testimony of one of the abductees."" 
""This is the response I gave them,"" he wrote. ""This is not a ‘claim.’ This is the testimony of a survivor, an abductee who was held captive by Hamas. More evidence is coming. While Hamas is holding 136 Israeli hostages in Gaza, I cannot share information that could endanger them or identify the survivor.""

""I hope UNRWA takes this more seriously than Hamas's theft of its stocks and misuse of its civilian facilities for terrorist activities,"" he added.  
UNRWA’s director of communications Juliette Touma told Fox News Digital that the agency remained ""very keen to get more information on what is a very, very serious allegation,"" and noted that they had not heard back from the journalist.
Blackburn separately told Fox News Digital that if the allegations prove true, the U.S. must ""immediately defund this terrorist-sympathizing organization."" 
HAMAS TERRORISTS BRANDED ISRAELI CHILDREN HOSTAGES IN CASE THEY ESCAPED, RELATIVE SAYS
""Not one more U.S. taxpayer dollar should go towards funding UNRWA,"" Blackburn stressed. ""We have known for years that this is an antisemitic organization. It has become crystal clear that the United Nations is complicit in Hamas’ terrorism.""
On Friday, UNRWA also found itself in hot water as the Israel Defense Forces posted video of troops discovering what appeared to be dozens of rockets, mortars and other explosives hidden under UNRWA boxes in a residential home. 
Marcus Sheff, CEO of the London-based Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education, slammed UNRWA in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying the agency is guilty of ""complicity"" in ""creating a fertile ground for terrorism.""

""Teaching materials branded with the U.N. Agency logo created by UNRWA education departments as well as textbooks used in its schools in Gaza teach kids to glorify violence and promote terror for years,"" Sheff said. ""It is no surprise that a UNRWA teacher was involved in the hostage taking by Hamas given the daily indoctrination he is involved with every day.""
""The U.S. must join Germany and other European countries reassessing and conditioning their aid to UNRWA until it uses an alternative curriculum that promotes peace and tolerance otherwise another Oct 7th will occur as Hamas leaders promise,"" Sheff demanded.

Last week, Germany announced it would freeze funding to UNRWA amid reports that the group was complicit in a number of controversies, including the dissemination of antisemitic material, inciting violence and alumni connected to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the National Review reported. 
Former President Trump pulled the plug on U.S. UNRWA funding in 2018. The Biden administration swiftly restored the money to UNRWA, and in July 2022, announced it had given more money to UNRWA than any other organization in the world.
UNRWA's spokesperson told Fox News Digital that she was not yet aware of Blackburn's plans in regard to her call for an investigation over the allegations against the U.N. agency.

Rep. Zinke wants Congress to shut down Palestinian immigration: ‘Enough is enough’,2023-11-03,Fox News,['Adam Shaw'],"Former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf reacts to the latest news from the southern border as concerns of terrorism rise
Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., is pushing Congress to shut down all Palestinian immigration into the U.S. with legislation that he says is ""very hard and harsh"" amid ongoing concerns about vetting migrants for potential ties to terrorism following Hamas' October attack against Israel.
Zinke’s Safeguarding Americans from Extremism (SAFE) Act would target any foreign national with a Palestinian Authority (PA) passport or PA-granted travel document, making them inadmissible to the United States.
Additionally, it would bar the Department of Homeland Security from granting green cards and temporary or ""nonimmigrant"" visas to PA passport holders and would revoke visas issued to those covered after October 1. 
ICE ARRESTS AFRICAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT, WANTED IN SENEGAL FOR TERRORIST OFFENSES, WHO WAS RELEASED INTO US 
The measure would block DHS from granting Temporary Protected Status, asylum or refugee status to PA passport holders, and it would revoke those statuses to anyone with passports if it granted this fiscal year.
""This bill looks and is a very, very hard and harsh bill. Absolutely. And I said from the very, very beginning. I don't think you'll find a more stringent bill on the Gaza region than this,"" he said. ""What has drawn us to this is that this administration has failed in every previous encounter to vet who has come in this country.""
The bill is co-sponsored by Reps. Andy Harris, R-Md., Aaron Bean, R-Fla., Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Scott DesJarlais, R-Tenn.,  Clay Higgins, R-La., Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, Bill Posey, R-Fla., Barry Moore, R-Ala., Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga., and Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.
It’s a step further than legislation and calls by other Republicans — including on the campaign trail — where candidates have called only for a block on refugees coming into the U.S. and also the revocation of visas of Hamas supporters.

""I think this is the most stringent anti-Gaza anti-Hamas immigration refugee bill ever, and I can tell you this administration is deserving of it, because, to date, I haven't seen them screen anybody,"" he said.
There has been renewed scrutiny of the potential connection between immigration and terrorism since Hamas’ attack on Israel. Republicans have noted increased encounters of people on the terror watch list at the southern border.
MAYORKAS CONFIRMS OVER 600,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS EVADED LAW ENFORCEMENT AT SOUTHERN BORDER LAST FISCAL YEAR
CBS News reported this week that a 20-year-old Jordanian man in Texas, who is accused of training with weapons to commit an attack, traveled to the U.S. on a Palestinian passport at one point. 
DHS has stressed that it has ""multilayered border security efforts,"" including screening and vetting, and has also said that encounters of known or suspected terrorists are uncommon. 
Recently, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) warned in an internal memo of the possibility that foreign fighters from Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestinian Jihad may try to enter the U.S. — although the agency says it has seen no indications of fighters trying to do so.
Zinke also cited concerns about the vetting of more than 70,000 Afghans brought into the U.S. after the 2021 withdrawal — concerns the administration has challenged — and says that the vetting of both the PA and the Biden administration cannot be trusted.

""I say enough's enough,"" he said.
He stressed, however, that he doesn’t have anything against Palestinians, and that this is about the ability to vet people. 
""I don't have any hard feelings towards the Palestinian people, but where we are is that this administration, given the population of what's occurred and the horrific acts that were done, we need to look at it as almost a pandemic and stop it from spreading. And this administration, again, it has shown that they're incapable of vetting.""

"Mayim Bialik calls out progressive feminists’ silence on Hamas rape, torture in Israel: ‘Where are you?’  ",2023-11-29,Fox News,['Kendall Tietz'],"'Jeopardy!' host Ken Jennings also told Pat Sajak about funny moments he's had with fans during an appearance on ‘Wheel of Fortune,’ in which he was playing to raise money for the charity Equal Justice Initiative.
""Jeopardy!"" host Mayim Bialik spoke out on social media, calling out feminists for their silence on the rape and murder of women during Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel.
""There has been an abhorrent and conspicuous absence of women’s organizations around the world unequivocally condemning the systematic rape and torture of women on October 7 by Hamas,"" Bialik wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday. ""Brutal gang rapes, sexual torture, and murder of fetuses happened- period. Where are the ‘BELIEVE THEM’ voices?"" 
""These crimes against women were in many cases documented by the terrorists themselves and broadcast for the world to see,"" she added. ""Those of us who have fought for women’s rights and have sought to shout from the rooftops when women’s bodies are being used in war for the sadistic pleasure of perpetrators are astounded at how the world has been silent surrounding this.""

The American actress and game show host is Jewish and is known for her feminist commentary. She called out the United Nations, specifically UN Women and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, which took 50 days to express ""alarm.""
Women’s rights groups and officials in Israel have worked to document cases of rape and gender-based atrocities carried out by Hamas terrorists during their mass terror attack on Oct. 7, but they said they have been ignored by the United Nations when they shared evidence of their brutal behavior. 
""We’ve sent letters and shared graphic documentation,"" Sarah Weiss Maudi, a senior diplomat and legal adviser in Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Fox News Digital. ""Their silence is so deafening that it’s sickening.""
""What I don’t understand is that we provided very graphic and descriptive evidence of rapes, including gang rapes and the remains of semen on young girls, it was not good enough for the U.N.,"" Weiss Maudi said. ""Yet data provided by the Hamas Ministry of Health is accepted and quoted without any verification at all.""
On the U.N. Women’s website, the only reference to Israel since the Oct. 7 massacre deals with the ""devastating impact of the crisis in Gaza on women and girls,"" where Hamas’ Ministry of Health estimates that more than 11,200 people have been killed, of whom some 4,506 are said to be children and 3,027 women.

Bialik tweeted a link to a piece written by First Lady of Israel Michal Herzog in Newsweek, who she said has been trying to draw attention to this. 
""In the 1990s, international agencies and legal experts finally began to see violence against women as a particular category of war crime,"" Herzog wrote. ""Organizations like UN Women exist to protect women from such crimes, while Israeli experts and activists have been involved in these international efforts. Thus, our second shock: The inconceivable and unforgiveable silence of these organizations when faced with the rape and murder of Israeli women.""
""It is not that condemnations of gender-based violence by Hamas have been weak or insufficient — there have been none at all,"" she added. ""Statement after statement by organizations like UN Women, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) have failed to condemn these crimes. They failed us, and all women, at this critical moment.""
Bialik also tweeted a link to a piece written by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, where she called on people to ""denounce these rapes in every conversation, at every rally, and on signs held on every street corner. We must forget our conflicting politics and remember our common humanity.""

The rape and murder of Israeli women was documented by Hamas, including in two short videos, shared by the terrorists themselves that emerged after Oct. 7, showing groups of cheering Palestinian men, some armed, in the streets of Gaza crowding around half-naked and bloodied young Israeli women.
The Israeli police and the Civil Commission on October 7th Crimes by Hamas Against Women is working to compile a database of gender-based atrocities, stating they believe sexual violence during the terror attack was widespread, systematic and even endorsed by the Islamic fundamentalist group’s religious and spiritual leaders as permissible during war. 
In a previous request for comment from Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for UN Women said the organization ""unequivocally condemns all forms of violence against women and girls, as well as any use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, which is a grave violation of human rights. It is never acceptable. International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law must be respected and upheld at all times.""

Jewish groups unite to launch ’The 10/7 Project’ combatting inaccurate reporting,2023-12-05,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"FOX News chief political analyst Brit Hume weighs in on the media's coverage of an explosion at a Gaza hospital.
Prominent Jewish organizations are coming together to launch The 10/7 Project aimed at combating the media's inaccurate reporting about the Israel-Hamas war as well as ""misinformation"" from the terrorist group.
The five leading groups, the American Jewish Committee (AJC), the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, call The 10/7 Project a ""new centralized communications operation"" meant to ""promote continued U.S. bipartisan support for Israel by working to ensure more complete and accurate information about the Israel-Hamas war in real time for policymakers and the American public,"" according to a press release Tuesday.
""Having these five organizations work together in this fashion is unprecedented and shows how important American Jewry believes this moment is to the State of Israel to combating Jewish hate in America and the world,"" the project's executive director Josh Isay told Axios.

The effort will also ""remind"" lawmakers and the public about the 100+ hostages that remain in Gaza, ""uplift"" stories of innocent victims of Oct. 7, ""set the record straight"" about the ongoing war and ""combat misinformation spouted by Hamas terrorists and their anti-Israel allies.""
""In the wake of Hamas's deadly terrorist attack on Israel, there has been an onslaught of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the conflict and Israel circulating on social media and, in some cases, elevated by mainstream press outlets,"" ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. ""Tragically, we have even seen alarming incidents of antisemitic violence and hate stemming from inaccurate coverage of the conflict. And while it's understandable that Americans are clearly interested in what's happening in the Middle East, The 10/7 Project will make sure they're receiving verifiable, truthful, and balanced information, especially at a time when some platforms have regrettably cut back on their trust and safety teams.""
Notably, Greenblatt made headlines when he appeared on MSNBC and slammed the network's coverage of the Oct. 7 attacks, asking if Hamas was ""writing the script.""

""Since October 7, there has been a concerted and consistent effort from Israel's enemies to draw a false and dangerous equivalence between Hamas' deadly rampage to destroy the Jewish state and Israel's right to defend itself against terrorists,"" AJC CEO Ted Deutch said. ""The 10/7 Project will be a trusted and timely source of accurate information to set the record straight and combat false narratives perpetuated by Hamas terrorists and their anti-Israel allies. They are responsible for slaughtering some 1,200 innocent Israeli civilians. This is no time for equivocation.""

""While most journalists are doing very important work under difficult circumstances, too many seem unable to apply the simple journalistic ethic of fairness to the Israel-Hamas conflict and to the issue of rising antisemitism in America and the world,"" Isay told Axios.

Netanyahu says IDF encircling Hamas Gaza leader’s house,2023-12-06,Fox News,['Greg Norman'],"FOX News’ Trey Yingst breaks down the latest developments in Israel’s ground campaign in Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that his country’s military is now ""encircling"" the home of Hamas’ leader in the Gaza Strip, Yahya Sinwar. 
""Last night I said that our forces can reach anywhere in the Gaza Strip. Now they are encircling Sinwar's house. So his house is not his fortress, and he can escape, but it's only a matter of time before we get him,"" Netanyahu said in a video announcement. 
""Secondly, we exert pressure to allow the Red Cross visits of our hostages. Further to that, today I spoke again with the president of the Red Cross and told her to turn to Qatar, which has been proven to have leverage on Hamas, and demand Red Cross visits to our hostages, and of course the supply of medicine for them,"" Netnayahu added. 
Sinwar is believed to be somewhere in the Palestinian enclave but hidden in Hamas’ vast underground network of tunnels.

Julianna Margulies: College kids with ‘they/them’ pronouns supporting Hamas would be ‘beheaded’ in Gaza,2023-12-01,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"Hunter College sophomore Gideon Askowitz and University of Pennsylvania senior Eyal Yakoby discuss antisemitic upticks in their collegiate environments.
Television actress Julianna Margulies took aim at college kids using ""they/them"" pronouns who've been marching in solidarity with Hamas, saying they'd be the first to be ""beheaded"" if they were ever in Gaza. 
Margulies, who has been outspoken about antisemitism following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks against Israel, went viral Thursday among her critics offended by comments she made on the ""Back Room"" podcast last week after host Andy Ostroy said there would be a bigger ""uproar"" if the ""wrong pronouns"" were used on a college campus. 
""It's those kids who are spewing antisemitic hate that have no idea if they stepped foot in an Islamic country, these people who want us to call them 'they/them' or whatever they want us to call them, which I have respectfully really made a point of doing. Like be whoever you want to be. It's those people that will be the first people beheaded, and their heads played with as a soccer ball, like a soccer ball on the field,"" Margulies said. ""And that's who they're supporting? Terrorists who don't want women to have their rights, don't want LGB- LGBTQ people get executed bar none… and this is who you're supporting."" 
""It is so insane to me that it is laughable if it wasn't so sad,"" she exclaimed.

""The Good Wife"" star took aim at college educators, wondering ""Where are the professors calling all of these students into the auditorium and saying ‘Hold on a minute. Guys, do you understand what a terrorism organization is about? Learn what you are supporting.’""
""There are Muslims, Christians, Catholics, Buddhists, and Jews that are being held hostage, and you're ripping down posters? Why?"" Margulies asked. ""What is that going to do? What are you actually trying to say?""
BROWN UNIVERSITY PREZ OMITS REFERENCES TO JEWISH STUDENTS IN SPEECH AFTER PRO-PALESTINIAN ACTIVISTS HECKLE HER
Later in the interview, Margulies blasted a Black Lesbian club at Columbia University that made headlines last month after it banned ""Zionists"" from a film screening on campus. 
""As someone who plays a lesbian journalist on ‘The Morning Show,’ I'm more offended by it as a lesbian than I am as a Jew, to be honest with you, because I want to say to them, ‘You f---ing idiots,'"" Margulies said. ""'You don't exist. Like you're even lower than the Jews. A. you're Black and B. you're gay! And you're turning your back against the people who support you? Because Jews, they rally around everybody.'""

Margulies, who is Jewish, expressed her dismay at the lack of support there has been for Jews in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks.
""I'm the first person to march in Black Lives Matter. When that happened to George Floyd, I put a black screen on my Instagram- like I ran to support my Black brothers and sisters,"" Margulies said. ""When LGBTQ people are being attacked, I run. I made a commercial for same-sex marriage with my husband in 2012. Like I am the first person to jump up when something is wrong as I think most Jews are because we have been persecuted from the beginning of time. Not just in World War II but literally from the beginning of time when we first lived in Israel, way before anybody else.""
THE MOST EXTREME ANTI-ISRAEL, HAMAS-SYMPATHIZING MOMENTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES SINCE THE OCT. 7 ATTACKS
She then said TikTok ""should be banned"" after its users were promoting Osama bin Laden's infamous Letter to America defending the panning of 9/11, saying social media ""literally has distorted pretty much all of history."" She also slammed news organizations like The New York Times and the BBC for their ""careless"" coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. 
""Hamas owns the media. Hamas puts out what they want the world to believe,"" Margulies said.

The three-time Emmy winner went on to shame her own industry in Hollywood for its weak response following Oct. 7. 
""Can you imagine the WGA [Writers Guild of America] not putting out a statement after George Floyd? And yet when it was the Jews- the Jews, by the way, all of our great material on television is pretty much from the Jews! The fact that they stayed silent for so long until they were pressured into making a statement,"" Margulies said. By the way, Me Too movement. The Me Too movement! Women- they cut a fetus out of a pregnant woman's stomach and filmed it. And the Me Too movement isn't condemning Hamas?""
She continued, ""My industry- and I love what I do, of course all the Jews are gonna speak up. it's the non-Jews that need to speak up. And it really, it really brings me back tonight to the Holocaust and how our ancestors must have felt when their friends suddenly were like, 'Sorry, you can't come over anymore.'""

"Scandal-plagued liberal college faces new probe over antisemitism, embrace of Hamas",2023-11-11,Fox News,['Benjamin Weinthal'],"A provost at the University of Austin, Jacob Howland, expects the school to receive a wave of applicants amid rising antisemitism on college campuses.
The scenic Ohio-based Oberlin College has been rocked again by a major antisemitism scandal with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights investigating the college for failing to stop harassment of Jewish students.
The new federal probe is just the latest setback for the liberal arts college, which has been reeling from a 2021 Fox News Digital report that its ""Professor of Peace"" Mohammad Jafar Mahallati called for the eradication of the Jewish state when he served as the Islamic Republic of Iran’s ambassador to the U.N. in the late 1980s.
According to a late September U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) letter, ""OCR will investigate whether the College failed to respond to the harassment of students based on national origin (shared Jewish ancestry).""
The OCR letter was sent to Oberlin College alumnus Dr. Melissa Landa, who filed the formal complaint in 2019. Landa told Fox News Digital: ""Before Professor Mahallati deleted his students' blogs, I read them along with other alumni, and saw that they reflected his violent antisemitic teachings. Through his lectures and his readings, Mahallati taught his students that Israel is an apartheid, settler-colonial regime and that Hamas is a benevolent organization that represents the will of the Palestinian people.""

Landa spoke to ""The Big Money Show"" on Fox Business in early November about the alleged outbreaks of antisemitism at Oberlin College.
The OCR investigation into the management of Oberlin College and Mahallati coincides with Hamas’ mass murder of 1,400 people in southern Israel on October 7. The massacre has catapulted Hamas’ lethal antisemitism and violent jihadi ideology into the spotlight. Landa said, ""Mahallati endorsed the terrorist group that was responsible for the worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. For this reason alone, Oberlin should terminate his employment.""
Landa, who graduated from the college in 1986, said ""Oberlin College is happy to see Jewish students attending Shabbat dinners and baking challah on Friday afternoons. But there is intolerance for Jewish students and faculty who wish to express their Jewishness by supporting Israel. There is a fundamental lack of understanding that for most Jews, a connection to Israel is central to their Jewish identity and an expectation that to be accepted on Oberlin's campus, all expression of that Zionist expression must be forfeited.""
Andrea Simakis, director of media relations for Oberlin College, told Fox News Digital, ""On September 29, the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) notified Oberlin of a 2019 complaint pertaining to alleged harassment of Jewish students on campus. This complaint was filed by a 1986 Oberlin graduate. Oberlin is cooperating with the OCR and working to respond to the request.

BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY BANS STUDENTS FOR JUSTICE IN PALESTINE FOR ITS SUPPORT OF HAMAS 
She continued that, ""Professor Mahallati is on sabbatical this semester. Professor Mahallati has stated that he believes in the right of all people to exist in peace and endorses a two-state solution that would allow the people of Israel and Palestine to peacefully coexist.""
Landa submitted a dossier to the OCR of the alleged anti-Jewish and anti-Israel incidents from 2014 to 2017, including student comments about Judeophobia on campus. 
According to Landa’s complaint, in the Autumn of 2016, ""Oberlin students enrolled in Religion 270 with Professor Jafar Mahallati of Islamic and Peace Studies post anti-Israel blogs online that reflect the professor’s lectures and assigned readings.""
The complaint asserts that Mahallati’s course teaching involved claims that ""Israel is a colonialist state"" and ""Israel is an apartheid state."" The complaint cites him in connection with ""support for Hamas and terrorism.""
Numerous Fox News Digital press queries to Mahallati were not returned.

‘DESPICABLE’: STUDENTS CONDEMN HARVARD STUDENT GROUPS' LETTER BLAMING ISRAELIS FOR OWN MASSACRE
Simakis said, ""Oberlin abhors antisemitism and all forms of hate, discrimination and harassment. The college works every day to ensure that our campus is safe for all students, faculty, and staff, including those who identify as Jewish. Antisemitism has no place on our campus.""
Landa fired back that ""To correct this oppression, harassment, and ostracization of Jewish students, Oberlin should adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. Alumni made this request to President Ambar a few years ago, but she ignored our communication.""
Oberlin College’s highly controversial President, Carmen Twillie Ambar, has refused over the years to meet with the family of members of murdered Iranian dissidents whose killings were reportedly covered up by Mahallati, according to two Amnesty International reports.
Fox News Digital has been told by critics that Ambar’s chief of staff, David Hertz, is said to vehemently oppose the college’s adoption of the IHRA definition. Hertz declined to respond to a Fox News Digital press query.
In a fact sheet supplied by the college Mahallati has denied that he was complicit in the clerical regime’s mass murder of 5,000 Iranian political prisoners in 1988.
The federal investigation into alleged Jew-hatred at Oberlin College is unfolding at a time when the U.S. Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona announced on Tuesday that he would pull the plug on federal funding for colleges if they fail to combat antisemitism.  In 2023, Oberlin College received over $5 million in federal grants.

HUNDREDS OF MIT ALUMNI PETITION SCHOOL TO TAKE CAMPUS THREATS AGAINST JEWS ‘SERIOUSLY’
Andrew Patinkin, Oberlin class of 2019, told the Jewish Press that the bashing of Israel is ""pervasive"" at the college. The 2016 Jewish Press titled its article about pro-Israel students at Oberlin: ""At ‘Liberal’ Oberlin No Speech Rights for Non-Haters of Israel.""
Dr. Frieda Fuchs, an Oberlin-based academic who has previously taught at the college, told Fox News Digital that ""Oberlin College has taken limited steps to ensure a balanced approach to the Israel question. Presently, pro-Palestinian students dominate the discourse surrounding the ongoing conflict. While it is commendable that Jewish students receive counseling, support, and comforting meals from organizations like Chabad, there is room for a more proactive engagement from all students.""
Fuchs, a veteran campaigner against antisemitism in Oberlin, noted, ""As long as Oberlin College maintains a culture of passivity on the Israel issue, the challenges related to anti-Israel sentiments will persist. Empowering students to take a more proactive stance and address the issues surrounding the Israel narrative is crucial. Overcoming the fear of potential social or academic repercussions, along with the support of campus leadership, is essential for students to express their perspectives and contribute to a constructive dialogue.""

In 2016, after a high-intensity campaign to oust an Oberlin professor, Joy Karega, who wrote a series of antisemitic Facebook posts blaming Israel and Jews for 9/11, the college grudgingly fired the non-tenured academic.
The prominent Iranian-American human rights activist Lawdan Bazargan has campaigned to compel Oberlin to fire Mahallati’s from his college position since 2020.  
Landa and Bazargan spoke at a protest against Mahallati on the campus of Oberlin in November 2021. Bazarga’s brother Bijan was murdered by the regime for his left-wing views in 1988. Bazargan told Fox News Digital, ""Oberlin College maintains that Professor Mahallati 'believes in the right of all people to exist in peace.' Mahallati's silence on the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas terrorists against Israel raises questions about his stated beliefs.""

Iranian dissidents from Bazargan’s organization have accused Mahallati of being loyal to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The U.S. government has classified Iran’s regime as the world’s worst international state-sponsor of terrorism. 
Bazargan said ""Mahallati has not publicly condemned the atrocities committed by the gender-apartheid Islamic regime of Iran against women, children, and youth. Despite the regime's well-documented human rights abuses, there is a conspicuous absence of critique from Mahallati on these issues. Furthermore, documents suggest that Mahallati glorifies Hamas terrorists and labels Israel as an apartheid state, yet he has never articulated his perspective on the two-state solution or acknowledged the rights of Jewish people to a sovereign state.""

She added, ""Oberlin College's continued support for Mahallati is a shameful endorsement of Mahallati's views and a disregard for justice, accountability and human rights.""
Oberlin College has a long tradition of radical activism. In 2019, the owners of a local bakery were awarded $44 million after being falsely accused of racism by students and members of the school administration.

"‘Squad’ votes on Israel’s right to exist, condemning Hamas reveal division in far-left group",2023-11-28,Fox News,['Brandon Gillespie'],"Do No Harm board chair Dr. Stanley Goldfarb joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his organization's report that found identity politics have been adopted by U.S. medicine and resulted in a 'fertile ground' for antisemitism.
The House of Representatives' Tuesday votes on reaffirming Israel's right to exist and condemning the terrorist group Hamas revealed division among members of the far-left ""Squad.""
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich, and Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., were the only members of the radical eight-person group to not vote in favor of H. Res. 888, which centered on Israel's existence. Tlaib was the only House member who chose to vote ""present,"" while Bush didn't vote.
Bush similarly didn't vote on H. Res. 793, which condemned Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 attack against Israel and demanded the immediate release of its remaining hostages taken in the attack. However, Tlaib joined the rest of her ""Squad"" colleagues in voting for the resolution despite her past refusal to condemn the attack.

After the vote, Tlaib told Fox News Digital in a statement about H. Res. 888 that ""both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live with democracy, safety, peace, and human dignity."" 
""This resolution that ignores the existence of the Palestinian people brings us no closer to peaceful coexistence. It’s important to recognize that Palestinians also have a right to coexist with Israelis in their historic homeland, with equal rights and freedom, rather than living under racial segregation or being subjugated as second-class citizens. This resolution falls short of that,"" she said.
""Israel does not have a right to carry out illegal occupation and apartheid—which will never lead to a just and lasting peace. Unfortunately, this resolution is a one-sided attempt to rewrite history, contributes to the ongoing erasure of Palestinians by not even acknowledging their existence, and fails to recognize the historical and ongoing Nakba in which countless Palestinians have been and are actively being killed, displaced, and driven from their homes,"" she added.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Bush for comment.
H. Res. 793 passed in a 414-0 vote while H. Res. 888 passed 412-1. Both needed a two-thirds majority to pass.
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., was the sole ""No"" vote against H. Res. 888, citing the language within the legislation.
""I agree with the title ‘Reaffirming the State of Israel’s Right to Exist’ and much of the language, but I’m voting No on the resolution because it equates anti-Zionism with antisemitism. Antisemitism is deplorable, but expanding it to include criticism of Israel is not helpful,"" he wrote in a post on X following the vote.

In addition to Bush, a number of other members from both parties also didn't vote for either resolution, although it wasn't immediately clear why. 
The ""Squad's"" general support for the resolutions appears to be a sharp turn from where most of the group was in the weeks following Hamas' attack when all but one member voted against a resolution condemning antisemitism on American college campuses.
Tlaib faced the sharpest criticism for her response to the attack after she repeatedly refused to condemn it and tripled down on her debunked claim that Israel was responsible for the explosion at a Gaza hospital that reportedly killed hundreds of people.

The House ultimately voted to censure Tlaib earlier this month for ""promoting false narratives regarding the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.""
The punishment, while largely symbolic, was a formal public rebuke of her comments.

Israel’s Netanyahu doubles down on rejecting Gaza cease-fire unless hostages are released after Biden call,2023-11-07,Fox News,['Danielle Wallace'],"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – after having a call with President Biden on Monday – doubled down on rejecting a cease-fire in Gaza unless hostages are released. 
In an interview with ABC News' David Muir, Netanyahu described Biden as a ""good friend"" but is conflicted with the White House's support for a ""humanitarian pause"" in Gaza. 
""We agree that we need to provide humanitarian assistance, we’re doing it and coordinating it with our American friends and with President Biden,"" Netanyahu said. ""We’ll do whatever we can. We don’t want to give Hamas the opportunity to endanger our soldiers. We saw that until we started the ground action, there was no pressure on them to release hostages. What we see if the minute we started the ground action, there is pressure.""  
""The President himself has said that a cease-fire would be a surrender to Hamas, would be a victory for Hamas and you would no more have it than you would have a cease-fire after the al Qaeda bombings of the World Trade Center,"" Netanyahu continued. ""There will be no cease-fire, no general cease-fire, in Gaza without the release of our hostages. As far as tactical, little pauses, an hour here, an hour there, we’ve had them before. I suppose we’ll check the circumstances in order to enable good, humanitarian goods to come in or our hostages, individual hostages to leave, but I don’t think there’s going to be a general cease-fire.""

""It’ll hamper our effort to get our hostages out because the only thing that works on these criminals, on Hamas is the military pressure that we’re exerting,"" he said. 
In the instance of Hamas agreeing to release hostages, Netanyahu said, ""There would be a cease-fire for that purpose, and we’re waiting for that to happen. It hasn’t happened so far."" 
Of the reported death toll of about 10,000 being killed in Gaza, Netanyahu cautioned against taking those figures at face value, arguing several thousand of those fatalities are likely Hamas terror combatants. ""It’s a very tough enemy, but we can’t let them have immunity. If we let them have immunity, David, then barbarians win,"" he said. 
""I think every civilian lost is a tragedy, every civilian life lost is a tragedy,"" he continued. ""We’re fighting an enemy that is particularly brutal. They’re using their civilians as human shields, and while we’re asking the Palestinian civilian population to leave the war zone, they’re preventing them at gunpoint. They’re using them as human shields.""

LIBERAL CITY COUNCIL DEMANDS BIDEN PUSH FOR ISRAELI CEASE-FIRE TO END 'CURRENT VIOLENCE' IN GAZA
""I think it is important to understand that there is no way to defeat terrorists embedded in a civilian population without going in a targeted as a way as you can against the terrorists but there will be unfortunately these civilian casualties,"" Netanyahu said. ""We’ll do, again and again I’ll say it, we’ll do everything in our power to reduce that."" 
Biden has advocated for a humanitarian pause in Gaza, while several Democratic members of Congress are also supporting ""a short-term cessation of hostilities"" in the region ruled by Hamas. Demonstrators in major U.S. cities and across the globe have been calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.
Taking that into account, State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters Monday ""that it is important for Israel to differentiate between Hamas terrorists and civilians even as Hamas continues to use civilian shields and Hamas continues to put their infrastructure and their rockets in places in civilian areas and have dug tunnels deep underneath critical civilian infrastructure in Gaza that has impacted protected sites like schools and hospitals and other civilian infrastructure.""

Patel argued a cease-fire right now ""would not prevent Hamas from continuing terror attacks and firing rocket attacks at Israel in the future. And on the contrary, it would let Hamas off the hook, allow Hamas enough time to regroup, and we can’t allow that. And no nation can be expected to tolerate those kinds of conditions.""
""But one thing we have been very clear about, both the Secretary and the President, have been the need for a humanitarian pause to enable a sustained flow of aid and voluntary movement of civilians seeking to depart. It would also allow an opportunity for the potential release of hostages, which continues to be something that we’re calling for directly.""

Turkey’s Erdogan says Netanyahu will face ‘war criminal’ trial after Israel-Hamas war,2023-12-04,Fox News,['Anders Hagstrom'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the ground from Sderot, Israel.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan claimed on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be tried as a ""war criminal"" after Israel's war against Hamas has concluded.
Erdogan does not recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization and has been deeply critical of Israel's campaign in Gaza. He compared Netanyahu to genocidal dictators of the past during a speech during a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul.
""Beyond being a war criminal, Netanyahu, who is the butcher of Gaza right now, will be tried as the butcher of Gaza, just as Milosevic was tried,"" Erdogan said, referencing a former Yugoslav president. ""Those who try to skip over the deaths of all those innocent people by using the excuse of Hamas have nothing left to say to humanity.""
Erdogan went on to criticize the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. He has long argued that the security council needs reforms.

"Stories of torture, torment revealed by Israeli children kidnapped by Hamas terrorists",2023-11-29,Fox News,['Ruth Marks Eglash'],"American psychiatrist Dr. Renana Eitan tells ‘FOX & Friends Weekend’ about the work being done to help child hostages in Israel.
JERUSALEM - As more of the Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attack in southern Israel are freed as part of a U.S.-Qatari-Egyptian brokered cease-fire deal, stories of the horrors endured during their 50-plus days in captivity are slowly coming to light.
Instead of the usual chatter, crying and laughing typical in pediatric wards, Dr. Yael Mozer Glassberg, a senior physician in the Department of Returned Children at the Schneider Medical Center in Tel Aviv, who is part of the specially assembled team of professionals tasked with treating the returned hostages, told Fox News Digital, ""It is very, very quiet here.""
Mozer Glassberg, who usually heads the hospital’s liver transplant unit, said so far, she and her team have worked with 22 of the freed hostages, including 15 children, in a specially created ward.
HAMAS TERRORISTS USE ISRAELI HOSTAGE RELEASE IN GAME OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
According to Israel’s Ministry of Health, a total of 69 hostages have been freed so far, 51 of them Israeli citizens and 18 foreign nationals, mostly from Thailand. 
While most of the returned hostages appeared to be physically stable, many lost up to 15% of their body weight during captivity, and all are afraid to raise their voices after their 50-day stay with terrorists.
""At the moment they are being wrapped and hugged by family members and by the psycho-social medical team,"" Mozer Glassberg said. ""At this stage, it is too early to discuss the outcome of what they have been through.""
While Israeli authorities have requested that the hostages and their family members not share in-depth details of their time in the hands of Palestinian terror groups over fears for the safety of some 170 others still being held in Gaza, the information that has come to light so far shows the sheer brutality and inhumanity of their captors, especially toward toddlers, young children and the elderly.
On Tuesday, Deborah Cohen, the aunt of 12-year-old Eitan Yahalomi, who was freed on Monday, told French TV Channel BFM that the terrorists forced her young nephew at gunpoint to watch raw video footage of the horrors they carried out on Oct. 7.
""It is the kind of horror film that no one wants to see,"" she said. ""They forced him to watch it and if he or any of the other children cried, the terrorists threatened them with a gun to keep quiet.""
Cohen also recounted how Yahalomi, who was kidnapped during the Oct. 7 attack from his home on Kibbutz Nir Oz without his family, was put on the back of a motorcycle by the terrorists and driven across the breached border fence into Gaza. As they drove him through the streets there, she said, people came outside and began to jeer and beat him.

UNITED NATIONS SLAMMED FOR SILENCE OVER HAMAS RAPES, MUTILATION AND MURDER OF ISRAELI WOMEN, CRITICS SAY
""I wanted to hope that he would have been treated well there, but apparently not… they’re monsters,"" said Cohen, adding that Yahalomi’s father, Ohad, is still a hostage.
Yahalomi’s grandmother, Esther, told Israeli media outlets that ""For the first 16 days, he was alone in a closed room.""
""Imagine for yourselves what he went through there,"" she said, adding that he was later put together with a group of other hostages from his kibbutz.
""It was much easier for him there because his caregiver from the kibbutz nursery was there,"" the grandmother said, describing how he returned thinner and now refuses to smile.
In another rare testimony, Thomas Hand, the father of 9-year-old Emily Hand, told a media outlet that his daughter, who was freed on Saturday, still speaks in whispers.
""The most shocking thing about meeting Emily was the fact that she spoke in whispers, to the point it was really hard to hear her,"" the father, a dual Israeli-Irish national, said. ""I had to put my ear very close to her mouth to hear…. in captivity she was told not to make any noise and you can see the terror in her eyes.""

He also retold how he had to share with Emily the harsh news that Narkis, the woman who raised her on Kibbutz Be’eri where she grew up, was murdered.
""Her eyes sparkled, and she took a sharp breath. It was very difficult,"" Hand said, adding, ""Last night she cried until her face was red, she couldn't stop. She didn't want any comfort. I guess she forgot how to comfort herself. She got under the covers, covered herself, and cried quietly.""
Alma, 13, and Noam Or, 16, siblings who were released by Hamas on Saturday, received similarly devastating news, according to reports from those close to them. Relatives said the two teenagers were imprisoned in a secluded room for 50 days and through that time had been hoping to see their mother, Yonat, as soon as they were released.
Greeted by their grandmother and an older brother, the two were immediately informed that Yonat was murdered by the terrorists on Oct. 7. Their father, Dror, remains a hostage, Israeli authorities said.
Over the past five days, relatives of the hostages have told of the difficulties they have faced in sharing with their now-released loved ones some of the terror stories from the Oct. 7 massacre, which saw more than 1,200 people murdered in some 22 communities in southern Israel, army bases and a music festival.

Adva Adar, the granddaughter of 85-year-old Yaffa Adar, who was released on Friday night, said that her family is working hard not to overload the elderly woman with too many details about the massacre on her kibbutz or the fact that her home was completely destroyed.
""She is only getting the information now of what happened, and is piecing it all together slowly,"" said Adva Adar. ""We want to give it to her in a way that she can process it, and it won’t be too much.""

Adva said her grandmother, who was released from the hospital on Tuesday, is getting professional help to deal with all the trauma, but the family understands that the recovery process will be long.
She said that right now, the most difficult task facing her elderly grandmother is ""starting over again.""
""To be an 85-year-old woman and have your home and all your memories, your photo album, and everything, destroyed is really tough,"" Adva said.
Merav Raviv, a relative of Ruthy Mundar, 78, her daughter, Keren Mundar, 54, and Keren’s son, Ohad, 9, who were all freed on Friday night, said they were also trying to catch up on the horrors of the past eight weeks.
""They were fed but not regularly,"" Raviv said in an interview on Sunday. ""Some days they did not get anything but some a few pieces of bread and both Keren and her mom, Ruty, lost about six to eight kilograms in weight,"" (approximately13-17 pounds.)

Raviv said that the family was forced to sleep on plastic benches and begged their captors to take them to the bathroom. Sometimes they had to wait for more than an hour and a half to be allowed to go, she said.
As for Ohad, who celebrated his 9th birthday in captivity last month, Raviv said that he had been visiting his grandparents on Kibbutz Nir Oz the day he was kidnapped and was ""very scared"" when rocket fire began and the terrorists broke into the kibbutz.
At the Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital in Tel Aviv’s Sheba Medical Center, Deputy Director Dr. Moshe Ashkenazi told Fox News Digital that he had so far treated around 21 of the freed hostages.
""There are some really shocking stories,"" he said. ""I can’t go into too much detail but some of what we heard has not been easy and, I must say, the strength of these people is amazing.""
Ashkenazi said that while no one under his care required urgent medical intervention, ""it is quite obvious when you look at them all, they have all been through a very difficult period – as you would expect from any person who has been kept in captivity for 50 days.""

In Israel, medical professionals began preparing for the scenario of returned hostages almost immediately following the Oct. 7 attack, when it was confirmed that hundreds of people, including children, had been kidnapped.
With few similar scenarios worldwide to draw from, Ashkenazi said the hospital, like others in Israel, put together a multidisciplinary team of experts including psychologists, psychiatrists and other experts to help with the rehabilitation of those they hoped would soon return.
At Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel, one hostage, Elma Avraham, 84, who was released Sunday night, arrived in critical condition, her daughter, Tali Amano said in a statement.
""We waited for my mother for 52 days,"" she said. ""My mother is 84 years old, a grandmother and great-grandmother. She is a happy woman, incredibly optimistic. She was taken out of her house and kidnapped on a motorcycle; she was functioning. She lived independently, cooked for herself, and took care of all of her needs – including taking her prescription medication to deal with her chronic illnesses.""
Amano said her mother, who suffered from a thyroid disease, heart disease and autoimmune disease, ""was completely neglected medically"" and ""arrived home on the brink of death.""
On Tuesday, the hospital said that Avraham’s condition had improved and that she was awake and breathing on her own.

According to Israel’s Ministry of Health, a total of 69 hostages have been freed so far, 51 of them Israeli citizens and a further 18 foreign nationals, mostly from Thailand who had been working in Israel on the day of the attack. Out of those released, 30 are children, 20 are women, mostly mothers and senior citizens, and one man.
Israel believes that nine Israeli children, including a 10-month-old baby, remain in captivity.

‘Squad’ Dems face backlash calling for ‘ceasefire’ after Israel attacks: ‘Can’t merely condemn terrorism’,2023-10-07,Fox News,"['Houston Keene', 'Landon Mion']","FOX News’ Trey Yingst reports on what civilians experienced during Saturday’s Hamas attack on Israel and the ‘massive barrage’ in Southern Israel.
""Squad"" House Democrats known for criticizing the state of Israel faced massive backlash from conservatives online over their milquetoast statements following Hamas' deadly surprise attack on Israel.
Several members of the informal progressive caucus published statements on Saturday condemning the violence and calling for the conflict to de-escalate.
Of the ""Squad"" members, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has been silent on the attack on Israel.
‘SQUAD’ DEMOCRAT CALLS FOR END OF ISRAEL'S ‘GAZA BLOCKADE’ AS HE CONDEMNS HAMAS TERROR ATTACKS

Fox News Digital reached out to Tlaib's office for comment on the deadly surprise terrorist attack on Israel but did not receive a response.
Meanwhile, ""Squad"" queen Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., called for a ""ceasefire and de-escalation"" after the surprise terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel.
""Today is devastating for all those seeking a lasting peace and respect for human rights in Israel and Palestine. I condemn Hamas’ attack in the strongest possible terms,"" the New York Democrat said in a statement.
""No child and family should ever endure this kind of violence and fear, and this violence will not solve the ongoing oppression and occupation in the region,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued.
""An immediate ceasefire and de-escalation is urgently needed to save lives,"" she added.
Ocasio-Cortez's statement drew criticism from South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, who referred to her Democrat colleague as a ""Hamas apologist.""
""Hamas apologist asking for 'ceasefire' after one side launches a massive terrorist attack. Nice try,"" Mace wrote.
Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – who has a history of controversial statements about Israel – condemned ""the horrific acts we are seeing unfold today in Israel against children, women, the elderly, and the unarmed people who are being slaughtered and taken hostage by Hamas.""
""Such senseless violence will only repeat the back and forth cycle we've seen, which we cannot allow to continue,"" Omar said.
""We need to call for deescalation and ceasefire,"" she continued. ""I will keep advocating for peace and justice throughout the Middle East.""
""FOX & Friends Weekend"" co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy criticized Omar in a response to her statement, saying the congresswoman ""will never acknowledge that there was peace in the Middle East [and] Europe when Trump was in office.""
Conservative commentator John Hasson also blasted Omar over her tweet.
""Notice how she only condemns the acts against 'children, women, the elderly, and the unarmed.'"" Hasson wrote. ""She’s implying that attacking/killing IDF forces is fine.""
In 2021, Omar landed in hot water with senior members of her own party as well as her opponents when she compared America and Israel to murderous terrorist groups Hamas and the Taliban, saying the two democracies have committed ""unthinkable atrocities.""
""We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban,"" Omar wrote at the time. ""I asked [Secretary of State Antony Blinken] where people are supposed to go for justice.""
Additionally, during a 2021 cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, Omar said the fighting stopping wasn’t enough and that the U.S. was ""underwriting crimes against humanity"" through support for Israel and that there needed to be ""accountability for every war crime committed.""
Amid the 2021 conflict, Omar also accused Israel of engaging in ""terrorism"" through their airstrikes that tragically killed civilians in the Gaza Strip.
In 2019, during her first term in office, Omar came under fire for a since-deleted tweet from 2012, where she wrote ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."" (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
""Israeli air strikes killing civilians in Gaza is an act of terrorism. Palestinians deserve protection. Unlike Israel, missile defense programs, such as Iron Dome, don’t exist to protect Palestinian civilians. It’s unconscionable to not condemn these attacks on the week of Eid,"" Omar wrote on social media at the time.
In 2019, during her first term in office, Omar came under fire for a since-deleted tweet from 2012, where she wrote ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.""
Omar said the ""unfortunate words were the only words"" she could ""think about expressing at that moment"" while referring to the Israeli armed forces’ 2012 operation against Hamas in Gaza. She also defended the comments while speaking to comedian Trevor Noah on ""The Daily Show.""
Omar, who previously expressed regret over that tweet, responded by saying she had to ""take a deep breath"" and ""understand where people were coming from and what point they were trying to make.""
Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley said these ""devastating attacks on Israelis are deeply alarming and my heart breaks for the victims [and] their loved ones.""
""We need an immediate ceasefire & de-escalation. It is long past time to stop this cycle of violence [and] trauma, and work toward a just [and] lasting peace in the region,"" Pressley wrote.
Conservative commentator known online as Comfortably Smug criticized the ""Squad"" in a response to Pressley's post.
""The squad telling Israel to stand down after it was attacked and hundreds of its citizens were massacred,"" he wrote. ""Incredible.""
New York Democrat Rep. Jamaal Bowman took to social media Saturday to call for an end to the Gaza blockade and condemned the Iranian-backed Hamas terrorist attack on Israel.
""I strongly condemn the horrific attacks by Hamas and am saddened by the loss of precious lives, especially on the holy day of Simchat Torah,"" Bowman said in a statement, which was shared to social media.
""We need a way to end this deadly violence that is killing and traumatizing generations of Israelis and Palestinians alike — including the blockade of Gaza,"" he added. ""I have been to the Gaza border and know that Israelis and Palestinians are constantly living in fear. We must work harder to ensure peace in the region.""
As new developments are made, Bowman, who made headlines recently after he pulled a fire alarm in Congress amid a vote to keep the government open, said he and his team will be monitoring the situation closely, ""especially since several of our Westchester service members are in the area of attacks.""
Conservative radio host Jason Rantz tweeted that ""Bowman can’t merely condemn terrorism.""
""He has to include his ignorant criticism of Israel,"" Rantz said.
Bowman has been criticized for his position toward Israel, and was one of nine progressives who voted against a resolution affirming Israel was not a racist or apartheid state earlier this year.
Rep. Cori Bush said in a statement that she is ""heartbroken by the ongoing violence in Palestine and Israel, and I mourn the over 250 Israeli and 230 Palestinian lives that have been lost today, and the thousands injured, following attacks by Hamas militants on Israeli border towns and Israeli military bombardment of Gaza.""
The Missouri Democrat said she strongly condemns attacks on civilians and called for an ""immediate ceasefire and de-escalation to prevent further loss of life.""
""Our immediate focus must be saving lives, but our ultimate focus must be on a just and lasting peace that ensures safety for everyone in the region,"" the progressive congresswoman wrote. ""Violations of human rights do not justify more violations of human rights, and a military response will only exacerbate the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis alike.""
Bush concluded by calling for an end to the ""U.S. support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.""
""As part of achieving a just and lasting peace, we must do our part to stop this violence and trauma by ending US government support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid,"" she wrote. ""I am continuing to closely monitor the situation, and my Office is ready to support residents of the First District with family members and loved ones in the region.""
Defense attorney Marina Medvin said Bush mourns the death of the ""Palestinian terrorists and equates that to the brutalities and butcherings the Palestinians committed of Jewish civilians.""
""Palestinian terrorists murdered children and their parents in their homes, kidnapped women and children and a bunch of young girls from a music festival, and this is the same, she says, as Israel killing the terrorists,"" Medvin added.
In July, Bush and Tlaib boycotted Israeli President Isaac Herzog's joint address to Congress. The pair of congresswomen said in a statement at the time, ""Bestowing President Herzog with the rare honor of a joint address to Congress while the Israeli apartheid government continues to enable and directly support racism and brutal settler attacks is a slap in the face to victims, survivors, and their loved ones.""
In recent weeks there have been protests in Gaza backed by Hamas against economic blockade of the region, which leaders described as aggressive.
""If there's to be an explosion, let it be against the party that created these conditions, which is the (Israeli) occupation,"" senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said earlier this wee, Reuters reported.

Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists invaded areas of southern Israel as rocket barrages launched from the Gaza Strip struck the area on Saturday, killing over 200 Israelis. 
A senior Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif, announced the start of the operation in which he called on Palestinians everywhere to attack the Israelis, saying in a broadcast on Hamas media that the group launched 5,000 rockets. He called the attack ""the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth.""
Israeli media reported that at least 300 people have been killed in the wide-ranging assault, while Gaza health officials say that at least 200 Palestinians have died in Israeli air strikes made in response to the Hamas attack. The death toll is continuing to rise as Hamas militants and Israeli fighters continue fighting near Gaza. The number of wounded people has risen to at least 1,590.

2024 Divide: Republican presidential candidates spar over Israel-Hamas conflict,2023-10-12,Fox News,['Paul Steinhauser'],"GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley shares how the U.S. should respond to Hamas' terrorist attack against Israel on 'Hannity.'
The sneak attack by Hamas on Israel — the deadliest assault on the Jewish State in decades — instantly rocked the 2024 White House race, altering the conversation on the presidential campaign trail.
While the Republican presidential candidates have tried to one-up each other in placing blame with President Biden for the horrific attack and showcasing their support for Israel, the Hamas assault has also quickly become a wedge issue in the GOP nomination fight.
Hours after Hamas militants swarmed into Israel, former Vice President Mike Pence took aim at Biden, decrying what he called American's ""retreat on the world stage."" 
HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS COVERAGE OF THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

But the former vice president, on the campaign trail in Iowa, seemed to save his most scathing rebuke for three of his rivals for the nomination.
Pence pointed fingers at ""voices of appeasement like Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis that I believe have run contrary to the tradition in our party that America is the leader of the free world.""
The growing schism in the Republican Party over America's role policing the world — evident in GOP fight over continued support for Ukraine in its year and a half long war against Russian aggression — may be spreading to Israel, where Republicans have long showcased their unyielding support for Jerusalem.
MIDDLE EAST BATTLE INSTANTLY ROCKS 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
It's no surprise that Pence was the first to take aim at other GOP White House hopefuls and has repeatedly criticized some of his rivals, including his former running mate, over their lack of support for Kyiv.
""This is also what happens when you have leaders in the Republican Party signaling retreat on the world stage,"" Pence argued. Evoking the late President Ronald Reagan, as he often does, Pence emphasized that ""it’s time to get back to peace through strength.""
Another part of the rift in the Republican presidential primary between the GOP's growing isolationist wing and more traditional conservatives pushing for a muscular U.S. role overseas, could be seen in a speech Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina delivered Tuesday afternoon at a think tank in Washington D.C., and in an ensuing interview on the Fox News Channel.
While blasting Biden for having ""blood on his hands,"" and claiming that the president's weakness ""invited the attack"" by Hamas, which was supported by Iran, Scott targeted DeSantis and Ramaswamy.
""Vivek Ramaswamy has said that the definition of success is reducing America’s support for Israel,"" Scott argued. He accused the multi-millionaire biotech entrepreneur and first-time candidate of proposing ""that we surrender Taiwan to the Chinese Communist Party as long as we’ve relocated some factories.""
WATCH FOX NEWS LIVE COVERAGE OF THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR
Scott also blasted the Florida governor, noting that ""DeSantis once dismissed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as just some ‘territorial dispute.’""
""The last thing we need is a Joe Biden wing of the Republican Party on foreign policy,"" he argued.
Scott, who has been running a positive and uplifting conservative campaign, for months avoided criticizing his rivals, including Trump — the commanding front-runner for the GOP nomination as he makes this third straight White House run. 
But the senator has turned up the volume against his rivals in recent weeks, as his standing in polls has flat lined.
DeSantis, campaigning in Iowa on Monday ahead of the Scott speech, pushed back at Pence.
""If Mike Pence wants to blame me for what's happening, I think that most people would just laugh at that. What a joke,"" DeSantis told reporters.
And on Tuesday, the Ramaswamy campaign fired back at Scott.
""We understand Tim Scott is attempting to gain some semblance of relevance in this race, but lying in the face of these barbaric atrocities isn’t an effective way to do so,"" spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement. ""Vivek has offered a clear, rational response that supports Israel while avoiding another U.S.-led disaster in the Middle East.""
Ramaswamy also fired away at former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who served as ambassador to the United Nations during the first two years of the Trump administration.
Haley, who knocked the 38-year-old Ramaswamy at the first Republican presidential nomination debate in August by arguing ""you have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,"" urged earlier this week that Israel ""needs to eliminate Hamas without question"" during an interview on Fox News' ""Hannity.""
Ramaswamy on Tuesday emphasized that ""I am disappointed and deeply concerned by the remarks of certain presidential candidates including Nikki Haley who have irresponsibly called the Hamas attack an ‘attack on America’ and rabidly shout ‘FINISH THEM!!’ repeatedly without offering a pragmatic path forward.""

Doug Heye, a veteran Republican strategist and communicator, offered that blowup of warfare in the Mideast was an unexpected development on the campaign trail.
""I think that there’s sort of a figuring it out as we go along part of this because clearly what happened this weekend was a surprise to everyone,"" Heye, who's neutral in the 2024 GOP presidential nomination race, said. 
Heye noted that the ""candidates can take swipes at each other, but this is an opportunity for them to demonstrate leadership as well.""
""I look at this as an opportunity for candidates with foreign policy experience to shine,"" he said. And Heye pointed to Haley and Pence ""as the two obvious examples.""

"MLB, Team Israel pitcher saddened over Hamas attack reactions: ‘Not a good showing for humanity’",2023-10-16,Fox News,['Joe Morgan'],"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The world woke up on Oct. 7 to the news that Hamas terrorists had entered Israel, indiscriminately killed civilians and took others hostage.
The footage of the atrocities could be seen on social media as Israel declared war on Hamas after the terrorist group invaded southern Israel and launched rockets from the Gaza Strip.

While most reacted in horror, declaring that Israel had the right to defend itself, there were some who attempted to justify or put blame on Israel for the unprecedented attack.
Zack Weiss, a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox and a member of the 2021 Team Israel Olympic team, spoke with Fox News Digital and expressed sadness over those attempting to provide a justification.

""I would say, No. 1, is just disappointed, sad,"" Weiss told Fox News Digital.
""It’s a bummer that there is some sort of justification for what took place,"" Weiss continued, expressing carefulness in his word choice. ""I think anybody who has seen the videos of what’s happened is familiar with any of the stories that you’ve heard from people, that’s just one-on-one disgusting terrorism at its core. It’s personal, it’s inhumane, it’s just so direct. And that action, in my opinion, is just rooted so deeply in hatred that I don’t really see how we’re seeing political organizations justify it in a political sense.""
""And I think that’s the point that’s really disappointing and disheartening a little bit is whatever your opinion is on the regimes in place, what we saw was horrific, devastating, should never occur human to human, and you’re seeing a justification. And I think that’s pretty disgusting.""

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) expressed ""solidarity with Palestine"" in a post on X, formerly Twitter, saying that Oct. 7 ""events"" were a ""direct result of Israel’s apartheid regime — a regime that receives billions in funding from the United States.""
""We unequivocally condemn the killing of all civilians,"" the post continued. ""It is imperative for international human rights law to be respected. But we cannot forget that the Israeli state has systematically denied Palestinians the right to self-determination for decades.""

""This was not unprovoked. For over 60 years, Palestinians have faced ethnic cleansing, torture, bombings, and housing demolitions. Gaza is still under a blockade.""
Beyond the posts on social media, pro-Palestinian rallies were seen in parts of the country last week, with the New York chapter of the DSA promoting a pro-Palestinian rally in New York.
Demonstrators at the rally burned and stomped on an Israeli flag and taunted Israel supporters with an image of a swastika. Others exhibited signs that read, ""Palestinian return by any means necessary,"" ""Israeli apartheid & genocide funded by the U.S."" and ""End all U.S. aid to Israel!""

Shortly after the attacks, more than two dozen Harvard student organizations declared in a statement that they held ""the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.""
""This chant that you keep hearing, ‘From the river to the sea Palestine will be free,’ that’s just another way of yelling Israel needs to be wiped off the map,"" Weiss told Fox News Digital. ""Because if you’re familiar with the geography of the region, that’s the land you’re describing. The state of Israel is included in that.""
""I’m not arguing against the people of Palestine being free and treated fairly, but I think to situate the blame exclusively with Israel without a recognition that Hamas is a terrorist organization bent on extermination of the Jews and eradicating the world of the land of Israel, I don’t think those are minced words. And I think chanting that, maybe to a lot of people who are uneducated and unfamiliar with the situation and the geography of the region, might not realize quite what they’re saying, but that’s what you’re saying.""

""It’s really important to me. I’ve always had a strong Jewish-American identity, and getting the opportunity to represent Israel was super special,"" Weiss said.
""When we went to the Olympics, we don’t just stay in any building,"" he continued. ""We stay in a secured, centered building. We have private Israeli security with us. We’re beeped in and out, nobody can get to our floor, obviously after what happened in Munich [in 1972]. So, the whole experience is just different as an Israeli. And so, obviously, it was a great sense of pride to get to do it. We wanted to represent the country well, and I think we did it well as [a] people.""

""I think getting to represent that was really special, and I have a strong sense of community and family with not only … Jewish Americans but Israeli Jews as well.""
Purely from a humanity standpoint, Weiss was saddened by some of the reactions after the Hamas terrorist attack, though not completely surprised.

""I think somehow the Jews make up 0.2 percent of the population, yet [billionaire George] Soros is the boogie man in America. There seems to be antisemitic [tropes] in a lot of what you hear, from kind of everywhere.

Protests continued Monday as groups took to the streets to support Palestinians and to condemn Israel over retaliatory airstrikes and military operations after a surprise deadly attack by Hamas against Israeli civilians over the weekend. 
Despite U.S. support for Israel, an important ally in the Middle East, in the wake of the deadly attacks, there has been a surge of support for Palestinians in several American cities. 
In New York City, supporters for Israel and the Palestinians gathered Monday as Israel battles Hamas terrorist fighters and targets Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

""When Palestine is under attack. What do we do?"" asked one demonstrator.
""We fight back,"" a small crowd replied. 
Shouting between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian supporters could be heard on the street as police officers tried to prevent both sides from confronting each other. Several confrontations occurred, but authorities quickly broke them up. 
""We're going to liberate Palestine,"" one protester told a group of Israel supporters. ""We already liberated parts of it already. So get ready to get barbecued.""
At one point, a pro-Palestinian demonstrator was seen with the Israeli flag wrappers around his shoes and another was seen ripping the flag to cheers from surrounding protestors. 
On Sunday, a protest in New York organized by the Democratic Socialists of America – a group that boasts six members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including members of ""the Squad"" – took place in Times Square and then advanced down 42nd Street to Bryant Park, close to the Israeli Consulate.

The DSA was almost universally condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike. 
The DSA laid the blame for the attack at Israel’s feet, posting on social media: ""Today’s events are a direct result of Israel’s apartheid regime – a regime that receives billions in funding from the United States.""
Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and invaded towns along the Gaza border on Saturday, killing at least 700 people, a death toll not seen in Israel in decades, wounding thousands more and prompting Israel to declare war against the Iran-backed group. Hamas also took hostages, including young children, Israel has said. 
The number those killed in the conflict has surpassed 1,600 dead and thousands wounded on both sides.

Palestinian supporters are urging Israel to halt the killing of civilians as several buildings have been brought down and destroyed during continuous airstrikes on Hamas positions in the densely populated Gaza Strip. 
Many Palestinian supporters have said the coverage of the conflict has been one-sided and claim their suffering is never amplified compared to that of their Israeli counterparts.  
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told President Biden that a ground operation in the Gaza Strip is necessary after Hamas launched deadly strikes on his country.

""Israel is at war. We didn’t want this war,"" he said Monday. ""It was forced upon us in the most brutal and savage way. But though Israel didn’t start this war, Israel will finish it.""
He said Hamas has ""made a mistake of historic proportions. We will exact a price that will be remembered by them and Israel’s other enemies for decades to come.""

Texas Rangers legend Ian Kinsler wears Team Israel jersey during ceremonial first pitch in ALCS,2023-10-18,Fox News,['Ryan Morik'],"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Ian Kinsler received a standing ovation when he threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of the American League Championship Series at Globe Life Park on Wednesday night.
Kinsler spent eight of his 14 years in the Major Leagues with the Texas Rangers, picking up three All-Star nods playing in Arlington.
He was a 17th-round selection in the 2003 MLB Draft, but quickly became one of their top prospects, and eventually a fan favorite. He had two 30-30 seasons with the Rangers, and is now a special assistant to general manager Chris Young.

But on Wednesday night, he made it clear he had other things in mind aside from baseball.
Kinsler is American-Israeli, as his father is Jewish. In 2020, he obtained citizenship in Israel, and played for the country during the 2020 Olympics. Earlier this year, he managed Team Israel in the World Baseball Classic.

"Zelenskyy to address US senators during classified briefing on stalled military aid to Ukraine, Israel",2023-12-04,Fox News,['Bradford Betz'],"FOX News’ Jennifer Griffin reports the Pentagon is ‘just barely’ keeping up as Congress debates the defense budget and gives an update on Sen. Tuberville's military promotion blockade.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to address U.S. senators Tuesday during a classified briefing. 
The briefing, which will include secretaries of Defense, State and other top national security officials, comes as the Biden administration has been pushing Congress to pass a $106 billion aid package for the wars in Ukraine, Israel, and other security needs. 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday highlighted the need for further assistance to Ukraine, saying Kyiv's war effort to defend itself from Russia's invasion may grind to a halt without it.

Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young has also warned lawmakers that the U.S. will run out of funding to send weapons and assistance to Ukraine by the end of the year.
But Biden’s $106 billion aid request is facing deep skepticism from GOP lawmakers wary about continued support of Ukraine’s war efforts at the expense of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
Many Republicans supportive of the funding are insisting on border policy changes to halt the flow of migrants as a condition for the assistance.
HOUSE PASSES BILL TO STOP FEDERAL FUNDS BEING USED TO HOUSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
Negotiations over the border security package broke down over the weekend as Republicans insisted on provisions that Democrats dismissed as Draconian, such as pressing for ""indefinite detention"" of asylum seekers and granting the executive branch power to ""shut down"" the asylum system. Talks are expected to resume this week.
Congress already has allocated $111 billion to assist Ukraine, including $67 billion in military procurement funding, $27 billion for economic and civil assistance and $10 billion for humanitarian aid. Young wrote that all of it, other than about 3% of the military funding, had been depleted by mid-November. 
Meanwhile, the GOP-controlled House has passed a standalone assistance package for Israel as it fights the war with Hamas in Gaza, while the White House has maintained that all the priorities must be met.

The new package proposes an additional $61 billion for Ukraine, $14.3 billion for Israel, which includes $10.6 billion for weaponry, nearly $14 billion for border security, along with aid for the Asia-Pacific region and other U.S. national security provisions.
House Speaker Mike Johnson reiterated Monday that House Republicans will insist on border policy changes as part of a Ukraine assistance bill. He argued Biden has ""failed to substantively address any of my conference's legitimate concerns about the lack of a clear strategy in Ukraine, a path to resolving the conflict, or a plan for adequately ensuring accountability for aid provided by American taxpayers.""

November 20 | Israel prepares to destroy Hamas in southern Gaza as calls for a cease-fire mount | Live Updates from Fox News Digital,2023-11-21,Fox News,[],"incoming update…
Coverage for this event has ended.


The Israeli Defense Forces said troops are ""operating against terrorist infrastructure and operatives in the Jabalia area in the northern Gaza Strip"" amid Israel's ongoing war against Hamas terrorists.
""As part of ongoing IDF ground operations in the Gaza Strip, the 162nd Division, in collaboration with the [Israeli Air Force], operated in preparing the battlefield in the area of Jabalia,"" the IDF said in a statement. ""The attacks on terror targets included support from fighter jets and UAVs. During the battle, the division struck three tunnel shafts in the area of Jabalia, in which terrorists were hiding.""

""The 401st Brigade engaged terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip, during which they killed terrorists and directed aircraft to attack from the air,"" the statement continued. ""In addition, the forces located and destroyed rocket launchers.""
The IDF said the troops from the Nahal Brigade killed dozens of terrorists over the past few days using the support of tanks and UAVs.
""Additionally, combat squads of the 551st Brigade, in collaboration with special forces, operated north of Jabalia in order to eliminate the terror targets in the area and clear a path for divisional forces and neutralized terrorist targets in the area,"" the IDF said. ""During the operation, troops killed dozens of terrorists with air support, captured enemy weapons in various locations, including private houses and children’s bedrooms, and located and destroyed tunnel shafts.""


The Israel Defense Forces said it is conducting precise operations in the Gaza Strip in the ongoing war against Hamas terrorists. The IDF also said an anti-tank missile was found under a baby’s crib.

""As part of the IDF’s activities in the Gaza Strip over the last day, IDF aircraft struck approximately 250 Hamas terror targets,"" the IDF said in a statement. ""Among the targets struck were dozens of terrorists, rocket launchers, and terrorist infrastructure.""
""Overnight, IDF troops directed a fighter jet to strike a rocket launch post from which rockets were fired toward central Israel yesterday (Monday). The post was located near a residential area of the civilian population,"" the statement continued.
IDF ground troops also located a ""significant weapons stockpile"" in the residence of a senior Nukhba terrorist in the Gaza Strip.
Additionally, IDF ground troops said they discovered an anti-tank missile hidden under a baby’s crib.


Jewish students responded to antisemitism on their college campuses, including chants for an ""intifada revolution"" and ""Holocaust 2.0"" and ""F--k Israel"" graffiti on the walkways, which sparked an investigation from the University of Maryland.

""There is only one solution. Intifada revolution,"" pro-Palestinian students chanted on Nov. 10. The university responded to the demonstration by denouncing antisemitism.
However, students Shayna Leibowitz, Emma Steinhause and Benjamin Blain are concerned about whether the university was just giving them lip service. Blain's family member – a 16-year-old girl – was killed during one of the Palestinian intifada terrorist attacks in the 2000s and said hearing the chants was ""quite traumatic.""
""The university has been understanding, but there hasn't been action taken… And if action isn't taken, these actions will proliferate and it will lead one to another. And we don't want to have to deal with those consequences,"" Blain said.

""In regard to the intifada. [UMD has] one of the largest Jewish communities, with 2,000 Jewish kids on this campus. And a lot of kids here have direct family members that were either murdered in the intifada or have grandparents that survived the Holocaust,"" he said.
""My relation is my mother's first cousin, one of her cousins was murdered, a 16-year-old girl sitting in a pizza store during the intifada,"" he said. ""And [Jewish students] having to deal with sitting in their biology classes, hearing outside hundreds of students referencing the Final Solution, calling for an intifada on UMD campus. It's just a really unfortunate reality.""
Steinhause described feeling scared to be on campus.

""It made me feel pretty scared because that is a call to violence and that has no place on our campus. I'm happy for people to represent whatever views they do have, but I think having any sort of call to violence on our campus is unacceptable. And the lack of like any sort of address from the university about that has really shocked me,"" Steinhause said.

Three people were arrested and charged in New Hampshire on Monday after a building was vandalized and damaged during a pro-Palestinian protest.
The demonstration was held at the property of a defense manufacturing facility whose parent company is based in Israel, according to The Laconia Daily Sun.

Sophie Marika Ross, 22, Cala Mairead Walsh, 19, and Bridget Irene Shergalis, 27, were charged with riot, sabotage, criminal mischief, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. All three were held on preventative detention.
Merrimack police responded just before 8 a.m. on Monday to calls from employees at Elbit System on Daniel Webster Highway reporting protesters blocking the driveway and multiple people on the roof. The Merrimack Fire Department was also dispatched because of a report of smoke coming from the roof.
At the location, officers found several pro-Palestinian protesters blocking the driveway. The demonstrators eventually departed the roadway, so officers could access the property.

After meeting with security, officers learned the front of the building had been spray-painted red, windows had been smashed and at least one of the main lobby doors had been locked shut with a bicycle anti-theft device. Three people also managed to access the roof.

A member of a Maryland task force aimed at combating hate crimes published numerous antisemitic social media posts
, including claiming that the babies brutally murdered in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack were ""fake,"" and comparing the nation of Israel to Nazi Germany.
Zainab Chaudry, an anti-Israel activist who serves as the director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations' (CAIR) Maryland office, made the posts in the weeks following Hamas' attack, which saw more than 1,200 people killed, including children and babies, as well as numerous rapes and destruction of property.
""I will never be able to understand how the world summoned up rage for 40 fake Israeli babies while completely turning a blind eye to 3,000 real Palestinian babies,"" Chaudry wrote in a Facebook post dated Oct. 26.

""[T]hat moment when you become what you hated most,"" Chaudry wrote in an Oct. 17 post, including two photos of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany, one showing it lit up with the Israeli flag in solidarity with Israel following the attack, and another from a ceremony in 1936 when it was decorated with the flag of Nazi Germany during the Olympics that year.
In another post from Nov. 6, Chaudry appeared to suggest the mere existence of Israel as a nation was the cause of the ongoing war, writing it was an ""inconvenient fact."" She included an image of the words ""it all started in 1948,"" the year Israel was founded as a nation.

There was chatter among Congressional reporters about wandering over to The Monocle for a drink last Wednesday night, which is an old-school Capitol Hill watering hole located next to U.S. Capitol Police Headquarters and across the parking lot from the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Senators sometimes hang out there while they wait for the body to get its business together for late night votes.
It was pushing 9 p.m. last Wednesday and the Senate was mired in a vote which began at 2:26 p.m. Senators struggled to work out a deal to finish up its work before Thanksgiving. The only reason reporters still lingered at the Capitol at that hour was because the Senate was slated to vote later to align with the House and avert a government shutdown.

There would have been drama surrounding a potential government funding cliff just a few days earlier, but not now. The question was not if the Senate would pass the stopgap spending package – but when. And since there wasn’t an agreement over a pending defense policy bill, the Senate forestalled closing the roll call vote until everything was settled.
That’s when word came from the Capitol police that all the office buildings on the House side of the Congressional complex were locked down. No one could come or go.
A massive, pro-Palestinian demonstration
 descended on the Democratic National Committee Headquarters just steps from the House office buildings. The protesters encircled the building, demanding a Middle East cease-fire, blocking anyone from entering or leaving the DNC.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., Minority Whip Kathleen Clark, D-Mass., Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., and other Democratic members were at the DNC for an event. Democrats huddled throughout the day at the DNC with campaign operatives and Democratic candidates ahead of the 2024 election cycle.
There is a tear in their party over the Middle East. Progressive, left-wing activists – fueled by college campus outrage – are fracturing the party over calls for a cease-fire and Israel’s assertion to defend itself.
That’s to say nothing of controversial comments by Squad members like Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., for a ceasefire and criticism of pro-Israeli groups like AIPAC (the American Israel Political Action Committee).
""What we need is people of good conscience and moral clarity to stand united and say Israel was attacked by a terrorist organization seeking to destroy the country,"" said Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday sent a letter to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul asking that the Democrat ban ""Students for Justice in Palestine,"" a pro-Palestinian group whom they allege has ""spewed hate and endorsed violence, from NY college campuses."" 
The letter, signed by more than three dozen lawmakers, points to rising instances of antisemitism at ""countless public and private universities throughout New York City and State"" in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack by the Hamas terrorist group in Israel. 

""These are extraordinarily difficult days for Jewish New Yorkers affected by a steep rise in hate and bias in the weeks following October 7th,"" the lawmakers say.

IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus appeared on ""Your World with Neil Cavuto"" Monday to discuss the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
During the interview, the spokesman accused Hamas terrorists of using ""psychological warfare"" against Israelis.

""Hamas is in a continued psychological warfare against Israel and most importantly, against the poor families of 238 Israeli hostages that are being held in Gaza for 45 days,"" the Israeli official explained. ""So until we see things with our own eyes and we can get our hands on whatever or whomever we get out, we cannot be certain of anything happening.""
Conricus also referenced recently-released footage of hostages being taken into al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. While Hamas officials said that the captives were receiving medical treatment, Conricus disputed that claim.
""When we released the CCTV footage from the hospital, [Hamas] immediately said, 'Oh, no, we brought them there to provide them medical care.' There's about 11 hospitals on the way... that they could have stopped that are much more closer and convenient If the real thing was to provide medical attention,"" he explained. ""It wasn't. They brought them to Shifa because Shifa is a Hamas stronghold.""

The former director of a New York University cancer center is suing the hospital and the university itself over his dismissal, alleging he was terminated because of pro-Israel social media posts some online claimed were racist against Arabs. 
Benjamin Neel, the former director of NYU Langone Health’s Perlmutter Cancer Center, said he was fired this month without due process and that he was discriminated against because of religion, Washington Square News, NYU's student newspaper, reported. 

Neel, who’d held the director role for nine years and is still a tenured professor at the university but no longer sees patients, said he was fired for reposting tweets on X that criticized those who supported violence against Israelis. Some online accused Neel of sharing anti-Arab sentiment, ""racist tropes, justification of collective punishment to glorification of violence.""

With the Israel-Hamas war lingering into its seventh week, the State Department was pressed Monday on how the Biden administration envisions the conflict ending and what precisely comes next. 
State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the Palestinian people must be front and center of any decision-making process, with the ultimate goal being the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
""We want to see the establishment of a Palestinian state that unites the West Bank and unites Gaza so the Palestinian people can determine their own future,"" Miller said. ""And that is the policy we support. It’s the policy that we will try to achieve.""

Israeli President Isaac Herzog appeared on ""The Faulkner Focus"" on Monday to discuss the newest developments with the Israel-Hamas war.
Herzog previously wrote a letter directed towards U.S. college presidents and urged them to prevent antisemitic attacks against Jewish students. The president criticized pro-Hamas protestors and accused them of supporting terrorism.

""I think those protesters who are supporting Hamas there, they're actually accomplices to the whole notion that you can butcher young children, that you can chop heads of women, that you can rape women and pregnant women.... you can do a whole bunch of atrocities,"" he said.
The Israeli leader also condemned the United Nations for reportedly not taking a strong enough stance against Hamas.
""The UN is a hypocritical organization where and they are playing for many, many years with antisemitic language and rhetoric ongoing every year.... [there are] automatic resolutions against Israel,"" Herzog explained.

U.S. military forces in the Middle East have been attacked at least 64 times since October 17, a U.S. defense official told Fox News.
The official says that 30 of the attacks happened in Iraq, while the 34 other incidents happened in Syria. The attacks have been a mix of rockets and one-way drones.

The three latest attacks occurred at Bashur Airbase in Iraq, Mission Support Site Euphrates in Syria and al-Tanf Garrison in Syria. No service members were wounded by the attacks, and infrastructure was not damaged.
13 of the attacks have happened after the U.S. launched air strikes against militants in Syria on November 12.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a press release on Monday explaining that their soldiers were working to defeat Hamas's ""Zaytun"" battalion in a ""complex war zone"", as the Israel-Hamas war continues.
""The 'Zaytun' Battalion is one of Hamas’ main battalions operating in the area of Zaytun in Gaza City,"" the IDF's statement read. ""The troops have encountered an enemy that is entrenched in the heart of residential neighborhoods, hospitals, schools and kindergartens, and attacks from within civilian infrastructure.""
The Israeli military says that they have eliminated ""many"" terrorists from the Zaytun battalion. The press release also acknowledged that Hamas terrorists were caught endangering civilians during the battles.

""During the last days of the fighting of the 36th Division in Zaytun, we constantly encountered an enemy hiding behind children, women and civilian infrastructure,"" Commanding Officer of the 36th Division, BG Dado Bar Kalifa said in a statement. ""The soldiers of the division, including soldiers of the Golani Brigade, the 188th Brigade and the Bislamach Brigade, operated in a complex war zone in an urban area, exposed terrorists who were hiding in civilian areas and eliminated many terrorists.""
""These achievements were made possible thanks to the close cooperation between the Infantry, Combat Engineering and Armored Corps and the IAF. We will not stop until we achieve all our goals, and we will continue to act to protect our home,"" the statement added.

Social media trend shows progressive Western women trending toward Islam after Oct. 7 massacre


A growing number of young, progressive Western women are converting to Islam, citing the Israel-Hamas war as motivation for the conversion – and they're documenting their journey on social media. 
Hoover Institution research fellow Ayaan Hirsi Ali issued a warning on the new trend during ""America's Newsroom,"" arguing young women are ""throwing away"" their freedom with the decision. 

""You are converting to throwing away your freedoms as a woman,"" Ali told Dana Perino on Monday. ""Islamic scripture, Islamic law, Sharia law and Islamic practice is crystal clear about the position of women, and it's inferior to men. Your testimony is half that of a man. Your husband can beat you. You have absolutely no freedom.""
""Everything is about your guardian having authority over you. First your male father, and then later on your male husband, and if those aren't even available, even your own male son has authority over you,"" she continued. ""So if that's what they want to revert to, good luck with that.""
The left-leaning women making the decision to convert have shared their religious diversion on TikTok, with many wearing the hijab, reading the Quran, attending pro-Palestinian protests and even learning Arabic as they accuse Israel of genocide.

US extends deployment of USS Ford carrier strike group in Mediterranean amid Israel-Hamas war

The U.S. military has extended the deployment of the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group in the eastern Mediterranean, Fox News Digital has learned.
The carrier group has been in the region for more than a month, and its deployment was extended for roughly 30 days on Monday, a U.S. defense official told Fox.
President Biden's administration says the strike group is primarily there to deter Iran and its proxy terrorist groups from entering the war against Israel.
 Critics argue the strategy has largely failed, however, as Iran's proxies have maintained frequent attacks on both Israeli and U.S. targets in recent weeks.

China hosts meeting with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Palestinians to discuss Israel-Hamas war

China is flexing its diplomatic muscle with a major meeting in Beijing on Monday, welcoming foreign ministers from the Middle East in an attempt to exert its influence over the Israel-Hamas war.
Its top diplomat hosted ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and Indonesia, saying his country would work with ""our brothers and sisters"" in the Arab and Islamic world to try to end the war in Gaza as soon as possible.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the foreign diplomats that their decision to visit Beijing shows their high level of trust in his nation.

""China is a good friend and brother of Arab and Islamic countries,"" Wang said in opening remarks at a state guest house before their talks began. ""We have always firmly safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of Arab (and) Islamic countries and have always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people.""
The meeting is a testament to both China's growing geopolitical influence and its longstanding support for the Palestinians and a Palestinian state.

Israel is negotiating with Hamas 'psychopath' for release of hostages, Herzog says

Israel and the U.S. are being forced to negotiate with a ""psychopath"" for the release of hostages by Hamas, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Monday.
Herzog made the statement during an appearance on Fox News, saying he could not confidently say that a hostage release deal is near due to Hamas' unreliability.

""Not much, really,"" Herzog said when asked whether he had new information about the negotiations. ""We are all waiting, and we are dealing on the opposite side with a leadership of Hamas, lead by Yahya Sinwar, who is basically a psychopath in the way he operates.""
""So nothing that you and I can say really changes the picture,"" he added before calling for the release of the children and women held hostage.
Hamas terrorists took roughly 240 hostages into Gaza following their Oct. 7 massacre in Israel.


Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane discussed the possibility of hostage releases and what the terms of such releases might mean for Israel and Hamas on Monday.

He warned that Hamas would be likely to ""declare victory"" in the conflict if their regime is allowed to maintain control over Gaza after the war is over. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that the goal of the conflict is to ""destroy"" Hamas.

Israeli forces clash with Hamas around second major Gaza hospital

Israeli Defense Forces are clashing with Hamas terrorists around the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza on monday.

Intense fighting has seen Israel encircle the medical facility much the same way it did with Al-Shifa hospital earlier this month. Thousands of refugees and patients are currently using the hospital, and staff say at least 12 people were killed when a mortar strike struck the second floor of the building. Staff say the attack originated from Israel.
The IDF has yet to respond to the claim.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claims that more than 12,500 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict.

Washington Post issues correction after wrongly reporting a U.S.-brokered deal to pause Hamas war


The Washington Post inaccurately reported that the United States brokered a deal to pause conflict between Israel and Hamas for five days to free women and children hostages in Gaza but issued a correction after being called out by the White House National Security Council. 
On Saturday, the Washington Post published a story that claimed a tentative deal was reached that featured the headline, ""Israel and Hamas reach tentative U.S.-brokered deal to pause conflict, free dozens of hostages."" The paper cited ""people familiar with the terms of the agreement"" and reported the pause in fighting would be monitored by aerial surveillance. 

The Post then shared the story on social media, writing, ""Israel and Hamas reach tentative U.S.-brokered deal to pause conflict for five days and free women and children hostages."" 
White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson quickly threw cold water on the report. She quoted it on X and explained, ""We have not reached a deal yet, but we continue to work hard to get to a deal.""
The Post then deleted the tweet promoting the inaccurate report and issued a correction to the online story.

""A previous version of this article, headline and accompanying news alert incorrectly characterized The Post’s reporting about the status of negotiations among Israel, Hamas and the United States to pause conflict for five days and free women and children held hostage in Gaza. The article stated that the parties had agreed to a tentative deal. In fact, Israel and Hamas were close to a U.S.-brokered agreement. The article has been corrected,"" the Post wrote.

House Democrat slams Bernie Sanders' call for barriers to Israel aid: 'Let's not play this game'

Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., slammed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., over his call to make Israeli aid conditional on its actions in Gaza, as the tensions in the Middle East continue to push a wedge between Democrats in the U.S.
Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, released a statement over the weekend urging President Biden to force Israel into curbing its West Bank settlements and pledging no long-term blockade of Gaza before the U.S. releases aid dollars.
Moskowitz pledged that he would work to remove those conditions from the legislation if it was sent to the House of Representatives or force stricter measures on aid to Gaza. 
""I am absolutely for humanitarian aid to Gaza. But if Bernie Sanders puts political requirements on the Aid to Israel, I will work in the House to remove those conditions or condition Aid to Gaza that requires the removal of Hamas,"" Moskowitz wrote on X over the weekend. Both Moskowitz and Sanders are Jewish.
""Let’s not play this game. Send the aid to both,"" Moskowitz added.

OPINION: My parents were taken by Hamas, they're not a footnote to Gaza war, they are its essence

An opinion article by Elan Siegel:
On October 7, life for my family stopped, and I don’t know when it will begin again. The civilized world is rightly horrified by the unspeakable brutality of the atrocities committed by Hamas. It is hard for me to believe, let alone write these words, but October 7 happened to us. My parents, Keith and Aviva Siegel, were kidnapped from their home and are now hostages in Gaza. 

Because my parents can’t speak for themselves, as their daughter, I want the world to know who they are. I want the world to know that they believe that love for humanity will defeat hatred. I want the world to know that time is running out to prove them right and secure their release. 
My father was born in the United States, while my mother grew up in South Africa. They moved to Kibbutz Kfar Aza more than 40 years ago, falling in love with this beautiful part of the world. There, they built a wonderful home for our family. In my mind, that home is a haven of love, comfort and happiness. 
But it was shattered on October 7 when terrorists invaded. They forced my parents, unassuming people filled with kindness and a quiet sensitivity, into my father’s car and We don’t know where they were taken. We have no idea what condition they might be in. We have heard nothing from them or about them since they were kidnapped.  

Eventually, we had to tell their five young grandchildren. We held hands in a circle and my sister (an American citizen like myself and our father) tried to explain where grandma and grandpa have gone. But how do you explain to children that monsters really do exist? Each day, they ask when their grandparents are coming home. I just hope that my parents are together, so that they too can hold each other’s hands just like we did.      

Israeli forces announce arrest of 300 terrorists in Gaza, interrogation on Hamas tunnel locations

Israeli forces say they arrested 300 terrorists in Gaza and have taken them into Israel for interrogation
 about Hamas tunnel locations and other key information.
Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari announced the action on Monday, saying members of all terror groups inside Gaza were among the 300 arrestees.
""We arrested over 300 terrorists from the terrorist organizations during the ground maneuver who were taken for further investigation in Israeli territory. The information that emerges from the interrogations of the captives is of great value, leads to the elimination of terrorists and the preservation of the security of our forces,"" Hagari wrote in a statement.
""300 terrorists from all the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip were interrogated and they gave the locations of underground terrorist tunnels, warehouses and weapons, along with exposing the enemy's methods of operation, and the enemy's assimilation efforts within the civilian population,"" the IDF wrote.



31 premature babies evacuated from Gaza's largest hospital as US confirms Hamas operations there

More than 30 premature babies in ""extremely critical condition"" were evacuated from Gaza’s main hospital on Sunday, health officials said.
A World Health Organization-led team said the babies had been safely removed
 from the Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, where power was cut and clean water, fuel, medical supplies, food and other essential items had ran out. They are now receiving urgent care in the southern Gaza city of Rafah and will ultimately be transferred to Egypt.
""The babies were successfully transported to the neonatal intensive care unit at Al-Helal Al-Emarati Maternity Hospital in southern Gaza, where they are being assessed and stabilized,"" the WHO said. ""Doctors there say all the babies are fighting serious infections due to lack of medical supplies and impossibility to continue infection control measures in Al-Shifa Hospital. Eleven are in critical condition.""
Many had dehydration, hypothermia and sepsis in some cases, said Mohamed Zaqout, director of Gaza hospitals. At least two babies died in the days before the facility was evacuated, the WHO said.
Fox News' Lawrence Richard contributed to this report


A U.K. doctor who worked at the Al-Shifa hospital says there were areas of the complex where he was not allowed to go on threat of being shot.

He said he frequently saw ""dodgy-looking non-medical characters"" going in and out of the restricted area, adding that hospital workers avoided the area for fear of Hamas.
""I was welcome everywhere else, and as I say, the doctors and nurses there were very welcoming and very kind, and the hushed tones under which this was said were consistent with all the other hushed tones with which Hamas was discussed. You know, people were genuinely fearful,” the doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told France 24.
“I cannot emphasize too much the air of collective paranoia that existed there,” he added.


His comments come after critics of Israel have cast doubt on the Israeli military's claim that Hamas used the Al-Shifa facility as a base of operations.
Israeli Defense Force spokesman Daniel Hagari shared footage of an Israeli attack on a group of Hamas terrorists attempting to fire an anti-tank missile on Monday.
Hagari says the group was trying to fire the missile inside an area the Israeli military had designated safe for Palestinian refugees attempting to flee south. The official went on to describe an exchange of fire with Hezbollah terrorists at Israel's northern border.
""Earlier today, the IDF attacked a terrorist squad that tried to launch anti-tank missiles in a safe area, in addition, the IDF attacked terrorist infrastructures of the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanese territory with a fighter plane, a combat helicopter and tank fire in response to launches towards the territory of the State of Israel earlier today,"" Hagari wrote.

""In addition, about 25 launches from Lebanese territory towards Israeli territory were detected at several points in the border area, the air defense fighters intercepted several launches and the rest fell in open areas, also, three unmanned aircraft were detected that hit near the IDF post, there were no casualties,"" he added.




Israeli Defense Forces say numerous Hamas hostages were taken to Al-Shifa Hospital following the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel.

Israel has obtained footage showing Hamas terrorists escorting migrants inside the medical complex, which Israel says the terrorist organizaton used to conceal a base of operations. They say at least one hostage, 19-year-old Noa Marciano, was murdered inside the hospital.

Top Netanyahu adviser says likelihood of Hamas hostage release deal 'has gone up'

Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, says the likelihood of reaching a deal with Hamas to release hostages ""has gone up"" in recent weeks.

Regev told 'Fox & Friends' that the past six weeks of fighting have been devastating for Hamas, and that the terrorist group ""needs"" a reprieve. He said Israel may be willing to pause fighting if Hamas releases a ""significant"" number of hostages.
Regev and U.S. officials have warned that no deal has been hammered out yet, however. Israel says there remain nearly 240 hostages in Hamas custody, though the U.S. has cautioned it is impossible to know how many of those remain alive.

Netanyahu slams Palestinian Authority for denying Hamas massacre at Israeli music festival


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday slammed the Palestinian Authority for denying that the terrorist group Hamas was responsible for the Oct. 7 massacre at a music festival in Israel that killed hundreds of attendees.
The Sunday night address came in response to an official statement from the Palestinian Authority that blamed ""Israeli helicopters"" for the death of hundreds of participants of the Supernova music festival near kibbutz Re'im.

The claim, echoed by Hamas, appeared to reference a report from Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, which said that an Israel Defense Forces helicopter had accidentally hit festival-goers while firing at terrorists.
However, the report, which cited senior Israeli security officials, did not say the helicopters were responsible for all the deaths at the massacre. Fox News Digital has reached out to the reporter for comment.
""Today, the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah said something utterly preposterous. It denied that it was Hamas that carried out the horrible massacre at the nature festival near Gaza. It actually accused Israel of carrying out that massacre. This is a complete reversal of truth,"" Netanyahu said in a statement posted on X.
Fox News' Bradford Betz contributed to this report


Rep. Dan Goldman, D-NY, says the roughly 240 hostages held by Hamas must be the top priority of the international community.
Goldman made the statement during a Sunday appearance on MSNBC's 'Inside with Jen Psaki.' He reacted to the news that the U.S., Israel and Hamas were 'closing in' on a deal to release more than a dozen hostages in exchange for a pause in fighting.
""This is what we all should be focusing on right now is the release of 240 hostages,"" Goldman said. ""That should be the focus of the entire international community right now.


The Israeli military eliminated three senior Hamas commanders in overnight airstrikes in Gaza on Monday.
Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst delivered an update on the situation in Israel early Monday morning. He pointed to footage uncovered by Israel showing Hamas terrorists taking Israeli hostages into the Al-Shifa hospital on the morning of October 7.
Israel has long claimed that Hamas used the hospital and tunnels under it as a base of operations.



Israel-Hamas war: IDF says hostage Noa Marciano was murdered inside Al-Shifa Hospital

IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari released new details about the death of an Israeli hostage during a press conference on Sunday.
IDF servicemember Noa Marciano, 19, was abducted by Hamas terrorists on October 7.
""Noa was taken into Gaza alive, she was held hostage by Hamas in Gaza City next to the Shifa Hospital,"" Hagari said. ""During ongoing combat, in the vicinity of where she was held captive, Noa’s Hamas captor was killed and Noa was injured.""

Hagari said that Noah's injuries were ""not life-threatening"" and said that Hamas terrorists murdered her inside the Al-Shifa Hospital after she was wounded.
""Hamas terrorists took Noa into Shifa hospital where she was murdered quickly,"" he continued. ""Hamas murdered Noa inside Shifa hospital. Our thoughts are with Noa’s family. We send our heartfelt condolences to Noa’s family. We did not reach Noa in time.""
""This has only made the IDF more determined to do everything, everything in our power, to bring all our hostages home,"" Hagari added.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels accused of hijacking ship linked to Israeli billionaire in Red Sea

A cargo ship linked to an Israeli billionaire was allegedly seized by Iran-backed rebels in the Red Sea on Sunday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it ""strongly condemns the Iranian attack against an international vessel.""

""The ship, which is owned by a British company and is operated by a Japanese firm, was hijacked with Iran guidance by the Yemenite Houthi militia,"" Netanyahu's office said in a statement. ""Onboard the vessel are 25 crew members of various nationalities, including Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Filipino and Mexican. No Israelis are onboard. This is another act of Iranian terrorism and constitutes a leap forward in Iran's aggression against the citizens of the free world, with international consequences regarding the security of the global shipping lanes.""
Israel Defense Forces also wrote on X, ""The hijacking of a cargo ship by the Houthis near Yemen in the southern Red Sea is a very grave incident of global consequence. The ship departed Turkey on its way to India, staffed by civilians of various nationalities, not including Israelis. It is not an Israeli ship.""

While Israeli officials insisted the vessell was British-owned and Japanese-operated, ownership details for the Bahamian-flagged Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier, in public shipping databases associated the ship’s owners with Ray Car Carriers, which was founded by Abraham ""Rami"" Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel, according to The Associated Press.

White House confirms Hamas terrorists using Gaza’s largest hospital as operations base,2023-11-14,Fox News,['Brandon Gillespie'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst on the latest from the war in Israel and the IDF battling Hamas outside of largest Gaza hospital
The White House confirmed Tuesday that Hamas terrorists are using Gaza's largest hospital, al-Shifa, and the tunnels beneath it as a base for military operations and to hold hostages.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby made the confirmation during a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, backing up what the Israeli military had been saying for weeks as the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) continue their ground operation in the Gaza strip.
""I can confirm for you that we have information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad used some hospitals in the Gaza strip, including al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them to conceal and support their military operations and to hold hostages,"" Kirby said.

""Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad members operate a command and control node from al-Shifa in Gaza City. They have stored weapons there, and they are prepared to respond to an Israeli military operation against that facility,"" he added.
Kirby emphasized that the Biden administration does ""not support striking a hospital from the air,"" and that it also doesn't want to see civilians seeking treatment getting caught up in a firefight within the facility.
He argued that the Israeli military had an ""added burden"" to protect civilians because of how Hamas had embedded itself within the Palestinian population.

""As we have been clear on multiple occasions, Hamas actions do not lessen Israel's responsibilities to protect civilians in Gaza, and this is obviously something that we are going to continue to have an active conversation with our counterparts about,"" Kirby said.
When asked by a reporter where the U.S. had obtained the intelligence to support his confirmation, Kirby said it came ""from a variety of intelligence sourcing,"" but that he wouldn't provide anymore data in order to ""protect sources and methods."" 
He added that Hamas' use of the hospital constituted ""a war crime,"" and reiterated the administration's stance that it does not support a cease-fire in the war.

Video footage released by the IDF this week appeared to show that Hamas has indeed been using tunnel systems that connect to hospitals for its operations, which backed up arguments by some experts that the al-Shifa hospital could be the next big hurdle to Israel's operation.
A number of military experts interviewed recently by Fox News Digital agreed that it was unlikely Israel would carry out a full-scale airstrike on the hospital, but all said they believed it would be a bloody battle.

"Teachers in Oakland school district plans pro-Palestinian ‘teach in,’ asks students to draw a Zionist leader",2023-12-05,Fox News,['Kendall Tietz'],"Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protestors clash during a demonstration in Brooklyn, New York on Monday, December 4, 2023. (Stephen Yang for Fox News Digital) 
Teachers in Oakland, California, are planning a pro-Palestinian ""teach in,"" scheduled for Wednesday, December 6, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital. 
Oakland Unified School District's superintendent, Kyla Johnson-Trammell, issued a warning to teachers planning to hold the unsanctioned event that she said is not aligned with district educational protocol.
""I want to again make clear that our expectation is that all educators, in every classroom across the District, take seriously their responsibility to adhere to principles of education, and to keep their personal beliefs out of the classroom,"" she said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. 
Materials included in the Oakland Teach-In Curriculum Resources ask elementary school-age children to draw what they think a Zionist leader looks like and what the definition of a massacre is.
A Lincoln Elementary School teacher who was identified by FOX KVTU as Jacob Fowler appeared in a YouTube video on Wednesday calling on teachers in the district to use the Palestine curriculum. 
HARVARD, MIT AND UPENN PRESIDENTS PRESSED ON ‘RACE-BASED IDEOLOGY OF THE RADICAL LEFT’ AT ANTISEMITISM HEARING
""We're asking that all teachers in the whole city participate in support of the event,"" the teacher said in the video. He argued a teach-in was an effective use of labor power and an important tool to give students ""counter narratives.""

Another teacher in the video argued teachers have the academic freedom to teach what they want, in part because they are backed by the Oakland Education Association (OEA), but other teachers told KTVU that the teach-in is not authorized by the official OEA and is instead backed by a small group called ""OEA for Palestine."" 
The OEA was under fire last month after it published an anti-Israel statement that said it ""unequivocally condemn[ed] the 75-year-long illegal military occupation of Palestine,"" making no reference to the October 7 terrorist attack, KTVU reported. 
""The Israeli government created an apartheid state and the Israeli government leaders have espoused genocidal rhetoric and policies against the people of Palestine,"" OEA said in its statement before it was modified. ""As educators of a diverse community here in Oakland, including those with family and friends directly impacted, our conscience demands that we say clearly that OEA calls for a ceasefire and an end to the occupation of Palestine.""
VIRAL ISRAELI SPOKESMAN DISCUSSES ‘FRUSTRATING’ MEDIA NARRATIVE FOLLOWING DEADLY OCT. 7 TERRORIST ATTACK
The curriculum materials don't mention the Holocaust by name and instead declares that ""During World War II, many Jewish people were killed and mistreated. The world wanted to make sure that never happened again. Unfortunately, the Zionists used it to justify displacing and killing Palestinians.""
Throughout the curriculum, the material indicates that Israel is responsible for massacres and that Zionists are colonizing oppressors, citing ""75+ years of Palestinian land theft"" and referring to 2021 as the ""2nd Nabka.""
The material also defines Zionism as ""a political goal of creating a country only for Jewish people,"" but the term is often used as a way to describe the movement that advocates for the development and protection of a Jewish nation, which is independent of Palestinian statehood.
""Palestine is a country located between Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon in the Middle East,"" the curriculum states. Although, the United Nations granted the State of Palestine observer status in 2012, it is not recognized as a state by the United States and dozens of other nations.

Josh Diamant, a Jewish music teacher at Lincoln Elementary School, told FOX KTVU that he strongly disagrees with the material, describing it as inappropriate and inaccurate. 
""These materials misrepresent history,"" he said. ""It misrepresents what Zionism even is. It reduces this incredibly complex conflict to simplistic slogans.""
HARVARD WHISTLEBLOWER POINTS TO ‘UNDISGUISED CALLS FOR THE MURDER OF JEWS’ AFTER LAUCH OF FEDERAL PROBE
Diamant said that most of his colleagues have told him they are not going to participate in the ""teach-in"" because they don't believe it is an appropriate topic to discuss with third-graders. He also said he fears what will happen if students were to approach him on campus and ask him if he is a Zionist.
""It's putting me in the position to set the record straight,"" he said. ""I'm not an expert on the Middle East. I'm a music teacher."" 
OEA for Palestine did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

"White House, Pennsylvania officials denounce anti-Israel restaurant protest: 'Blatant act of antisemitism'",2023-12-04,Fox News,['Houston Keene'],"Do No Harm board chair Dr. Stanley Goldfarb joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his organization's report that found identity politics have been adopted by U.S. medicine and resulted in a 'fertile ground' for antisemitism.
The White House, the governor of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia officials denounced the anti-Israel protest that targeted a Jewish-owned restaurant in the City of Brotherly Love.
Sunday night saw anti-Israel protesters in Philadelphia stop outside of Goldie Falafel, a Jewish and Israeli-owned restaurant in the city.
""Goldie, Goldie, you can't hide, we charge you with genocide,"" the protesters chanted at the falafel restaurant.

Goldie Falafel is owned by American-Israeli chef Michael Solomonov, who started out cooking Italian food before shifting to Israeli and Jewish cuisine in the wake of his brother David's 2003 death at the hands of Lebanese snipers while serving in the Israeli Defense Forces, National Review reported Monday.
Solomonov's restaurant was reportedly vandalized by the protesters as they targeted the restaurant on Sunday night.
The protesters' chants accusing the falafel restaurant of genocide went viral on social media, with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — a Jewish Democrat — denouncing the protest as ""a blatant act of antisemitism.""
""Tonight in Philly, we saw a blatant act of antisemitism — not a peaceful protest,"" Shapiro wrote. 
""A restaurant was targeted and mobbed because its owner is Jewish and Israeli,"" the Pennsylvania governor continued. ""This hate and bigotry is reminiscent of a dark time in history.""

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said it ""is Antisemitic and completely unjustifiable to target restaurants that serve Israeli food over disagreements with Israeli policy, as Governor Shapiro has underlined.""
""This behavior reveals the kind of cruel and senseless double standard that is a calling card of Antisemitism,"" Bates said. ""President Biden has fought against the evil of Antisemitism his entire life, including by launching the first national strategy to counter this hate in American history.""
""He will always stand up firmly against these kinds of undignified actions,"" Bates continued.

Pennsylvania Democrat Senator John Fetterman, an outspoken supporter of Israel, posted that the people accusing the falafel restaurant of genocide ""could be protesting Hamas.""
""They could be protesting Hamas' systematic rape of Israeli women and girls or demanding the remaining hostages be immediately released,"" Fetterman wrote. ""Instead, they targeted a Jewish restaurant.""
""It's pathetic and rank antisemitism,"" he added.
Democrat Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, who represents Philadelphia in Congress, also denounced the anti-Israel protest.
""I can’t believe I even have to say this but targeting businesses simply because they’re Jewish owned is despicable,"" Boyle wrote.
""Philadelphia stands against this sort of harassment and hate,"" he continued.
Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney told Fox News Digital his team knows ""that residents are concerned about the protest outside of Goldie on Sunday, and the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations (PCHR) is reviewing this incident.""
""While the City of Philadelphia will always protect free speech and peaceful protest, we must stand united against acts of hate and bias,"" Kenney said. ""We know the devastating violence in the Middle East has led to increased hate crimes and bias incidents against Jewish, Palestinian, and Arab peoples, and tensions are understandably high in communities across the country, including Philadelphia.""
""Here in Philadelphia, we have always prided ourselves on being a welcoming city to people of all faiths and nationalities. If you have experienced a hate crime or bias incident, you can report this to PCHR. Please call 911 if you have immediate safety concerns. Our priority in the City of Philadelphia is to consider and care for every community in our region that may be experiencing pain and uncertainty due to the conflict abroad.""
""We encourage Philadelphians who are in need of support to make use of the City and partner resources available to them. Our administration will follow up with the restaurant to address any safety concerns,"" Kenney continued. ""We are committed to supporting local businesses, and business owners seeking assistance can always contact Philadelphia’s Department of Commerce at business@phila.gov.""
The targeting of Goldie Falafel came amid a larger protest that reportedly saw chants of ""long live the intifada"" and ""there is only one solution: intifada revolution.""

2024 Republican candidates’ support for Israel under scrutiny by Iowa evangelicals,2023-10-25,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"FOX News correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on the backlash former President Donald Trump has received for remarks he made about Hezbollah and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 'Special Report.'
Some evangelical voters in Iowa are now saying support for Israel has become their top priority for the Republican presidential caucus, now less than three months away, according to a report.
For decades, Christian conservatives have supported candidates who protect the lives of unborn children and curb abortion, but Hamas attacking Israel has changed the 2024 landscape. Israel’s ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza has put new pressure on Republican candidates to directly address the conflict and emphasize traditional Republican support for Israel, according to The Associated Press, which interviewed more than a dozen Iowa conservative activists.
Since the Oct. 7 attack, Iowa’s evangelical pastors, faith leaders and rank-and-file caucus participants have been looking more closely at candidates’ statements, while ministers urge their congregations to keep those positions top-of-mind when weighing their options.
Several leading Republican candidates, including former President Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott, have told Iowans where they stand on the conflict and shared how they would respond if they were in the White House.
TIM SCOTT EXPLAINS WHY MOVE TO GO 'ALL IN' IN IOWA WILL 'TRANSLATE INTO VOTES': 'MESSAGE IS RESONATING'

In Iowa, just three days after Hamas attacked Israel and killed more than 1,400 people — which were mostly civilians — several Christian pastors delivered a message meant to resonate both biblically and politically.
""What we’re seeing in that region is pure evil,"" said Steve Rowland, a senior minister at the Rising Sun Church of Christ in the Des Moines suburb of Altoona. ""Israel has mobilized their army, and they are intent on stamping out evil, and we should be behind them. That's where we should be, and I want you to know that, as a pastor.""
Some Christians support Israel due to Old Testament writings that Jews are God’s chosen people and that Israel is their rightful homeland. Some evangelicals believe Israel is key to an end-times prophecy that will bring about the return of the Christian messiah.
DEMOCRATS SUPPORT PALESTINIANS OVER ISRAEL, GOP OVERWHELMINGLY STANDS WITH US ALLY: 2023 POLL
Evangelical Christians dominate the first-in-the-nation Republican presidential caucuses, and several GOP contenders have begun to discuss the conflict in black-and-white terms, even accusing President Biden of not being tough enough on Hamas or Iran, a financial supporter of the terrorist group.

Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, described the ongoing war to The Associated Press as ""between good and evil.""
""We've got a true war between good and evil, and we have to have a leader that has the moral clarity to know the difference,"" Haley said in Iowa.
Former President Trump remains popular in Iowa, including among fervent Christian conservatives, where he leads in Iowa polls and gets the largest crowds at his campaign events. He continues to highlight his record while in the White House of supporting Israel, notably moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.

Several activists interviewed by The Associated Press, however, were annoyed by Trump's criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the Hamas attack. Trump also said Hezbollah, an Iran-backed terror group that is fighting with Israel on the country's northern border, was ""very smart.""
BIDEN PUTS CONDITION ON HUMANITARIAN AID TO GAZA AS ISRAEL ALLOWS EGYPT TO DELIVER SUPPLIES
South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who has invested heavily in Iowa, often speaks of Israel's importance by referencing the Bible, which highlights Israel as God’s chosen people.
""Pray for the peace of Jerusalem,"" Scott told an audience in Newton this month, quoting from the Book of Psalms. Scott, paraphrasing the Book of Romans, said of Israel’s enemies: ""the wrath of God, let them feel it.""
DeSantis has also tried to win the support of evangelical clergy in Iowa, especially those who called Trump's criticism of Netanyahu ""a huge turnoff,"" like Iowa pastor Joseph Brown.
""Even though Donald Trump has done amazing things when it comes to Israel, we need some assurances now,"" said Brown, who leads Marion Avenue Baptist Church in Washington, Iowa. ""I don't think he understands the biblical foundation of why we stand with Israel.""
The Israeli-Hamas war has also caused concern for the civilian casualties, including whether the U.S. should accept refugees from Gaza, where many of its roughly 2 million residents have been displaced by Israeli airstrikes and face acute shortages of food and water.
Haley has expressed concern for the humanitarian crisis and said in a recent televised interview that the U.S. could appropriately determine which Palestinians ""want to be free from this terrorist rule.""
Following Haley’s interview, the pro-DeSantis PAC Never Back Down argued Haley was ""in support of bringing Gaza refugees to America"" — a statement PolitiFact later rated ""false.""
Haley did not call for bringing refugees from Gaza to the United States but instead called on regional countries to support the crisis.
""We should care about the Palestinian citizens, especially the innocent ones, because they didn't ask for this,"" Haley said during the interview, when asked if the U.S. should accept Gazans. ""But where are the Arab countries? Where are they? Where is Qatar? Where is Lebanon? Where is Jordan? Where is Egypt? Do you know we give Egypt over a billion dollars a year? Why aren't they opening the gates? Why aren't they taking the Palestinians?""
STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL CALLS IT QUITS AFTER BIDEN SAYS US WILL SUPPORT ISRAEL: 'POLICY DISAGREEMENT'
She added, ""You know why? Because they know they can't vet them, and they don't want Hamas in their neighborhood. So, why would Israel want them in their neighborhood? So, let's be honest with what's going on. The Arab countries aren't doing anything to help the Palestinians because they don't trust who is right, who is good, who is evil, and they don't want it in their country.""
Ann Trimble Ray, a conservative from Early, Iowa, told The Associated Press she is supporting Haley over her sympathetic stance.

"Clinton class at Columbia University disrupted by pro-Palestine protesters chanting, ‘Hillary, you can’t hide’",2023-11-30,Fox News,['Danielle Wallace'],"Protesters chanting ""Hillary, Hillary you can't hide, you are supporting genocide,"" confronted the former secretary of state outside her Columbia University class in New York City.

Pro-Palestinian protesters confronted Hillary Clinton outside her class at Columbia University in New York City on Wednesday, amid the Israel-Hamas war. 
Video shared on X shows Clinton walking past a common area of Columbia University's International Affairs Building as demonstrators chant, ""Hillary, Hillary you can’t hide, you are supporting genocide."" The protest, staged outside the lecture, was said to have disrupted a class taught by the former first lady and secretary of state called ""Inside the Situation Room.""
According to the video shared by BreakThrough News, Clinton, also a former senator from New York, does not appear to engage with the protesters, most of whom sat on the ground holding signs with messages such as ""Columbia funds apartheid"" and ""Viva Viva Palestine.""
The demonstrators – many wearing face masks – also chanted the name of Clinton’s co-instructor, Keren Yarhi-Milo, dean and Adlai E. Stevenson professor of international relations, saying, ""Can’t you see you are supporting genocide?""

""Take our demands, take our demands!"" the student protesters shouted as Clinton and Yarhi-Milo left the lecture hall, according to another video shared online. 
As both instructors walked toward the building's exit, the protesters added, ""Shame on you! Shame on you!"" 
Another clip showed students having signs that also read, ""Columbia Has Blood on Its Hands.""

In response to the incident, a Columbia School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""We continue to support our students who wish to express themselves through respectful speech while at the same time we fulfill our responsibility to maintain the core activities of our school. Today was a good example of balancing these principles.""
Earlier in November, Clinton and Yarhi-Milo were delivering a lecture to a hall of about 300 students about women’s involvement in peace processes when about 30 students got up halfway through and walked out in protest of the university’s alleged inability to keep pro-Palestinian students from being doxed, the New York Times reported. 
They joined a group of about two dozen students who sat in the common area of the building demanding ""immediate legal support for affected students"" and ""a commitment to student safety, well-being and privacy.""
COLUMBIA STUDENT PROTESTERS STAGE WALKOUT FROM HILLARY CLINTON’S CLASS
The walkout came in response to trucks that appeared near campus aiming to expose ""Columbia’s Leading Antisemites"" that had attached screens showing the names and photos of students who signed a statement that justified Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israeli civilians.
The statement said in part, ""The weight of responsibility for the war and casualties undeniably lies with the Israeli extremist government.""

The walkout protest earlier this month happened the same day Columbia University announced a task force on student safety meant to develop ""recommendations to prevent doxing, protect the identities and personal information of our students, and develop proposals to reduce tensions among various students and student organizations regarding controversial national or international events that affect our community in New York City.""

According to the course description on Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs website, Clinton's ""Inside the Situation Room"" class ""employs insights from diverse academic fields – including political psychology, domestic politics, and international relations – and the direct experience of high-level principals in the room to understand the key factors which underpin a nation’s most crucial decisions."" 
The course is said to allow ""students to engage with a range of case studies and examine decision-making in a variety of historical and contemporary contexts, from the search for Osama bin Laden, to the ‘red line’ in Syria, to negotiating with Iran.""

Iran-funded terror proxies launch war against Israel amid surprise invasion against Jewish state,2023-10-07,Fox News,['Benjamin Weinthal'],"Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reports at least 40 Israelis dead and 700 wounded, after Hamas' surprise attacks and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declaring war on the military group Hamas.
JERUSALEM, Israel —The Islamic Republic of Iran—a key military and strategic partner of the Palestinian Hamas terrorist movement in the Gaza Strip—is the driving force in the war launched Saturday against the Jewish state, said Israel’s Foreign Ministry and Middle East experts. 
Just this week, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, about Israel: ""The usurper regime is coming to an end. Today, the Palestinian youth and the anti-oppression, anti-occupation movement in Palestine is more energetic, more alive, and more prepared than ever during the past 70 or 80 years. God willing, the movement will achieve its goals."" 
The ""usurper regime"" is Israel for Khamenei, whose jingoistic foreign policy consists of the destruction of the Jewish state and the financing of Palestinians terrorist groups  on Israel’s borders. 
Lior Haiat, the spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, told Fox News Digital on Saturday, ""Those terror organizations [Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad] are working as proxies of the Ayatollah regime "" in the Islamic Republic. 
AT LEAST 100 DEAD AS HAMAS LAUNCHES UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON ISRAEL, NETANYAHU SAYS NATION IS 'AT WAR'
Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Republic of Iran, partners with the Palestenian Hamas terrorist group, are driving the war that was launched against Israel, according to Foreign Ministry and Middle East experts. (Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA/Reuters )
Haiat added: ""Iran is trying for years, especially in the last few months, to have a terror organization, both the Islamic Jihad that is fully supported and financed by Iran, and Hamas terror organization that is also financed but not fully by Iran. They are calling them to attack Israel and Israelis."" 
He stressed that Iran is ""without a doubt . . . behind the scenes"" of this war against Israel. 
The Iranian regime-controlled Tehran Times reported on Saturday that the Islamic Republic backs the Palestinian Hamas and PIJ war against Israel. According to the Tehran Times article, Iran’s Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi declared the war on Israel as  ""glorious"" that has murdered at least 100 Israelis. 
""We declare our support for this operation, and we are confident that the Resistance Front also supports this move,"" Safavi told attendees at the 6th International Conference of Solidarity with Palestinian Youth. He added that Iran will stand alongside the Palestinian resistance ""until the liberation of Palestine and al-Quds."" 
Iran’s reference to Palestine means the Jewish state, and al-Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem, the capital of Israel. 
The Iran-backed Hamas invasion of Israel follows President Biden’s decision just last month to release $6 billion dollars to Iran as part of a prisoner swap.  
While the Biden administration said the funds will be supervised by Qatar and not used for terrorism, Iran’s U.S.-sanctioned President Ebrahim Raisi boasted that the money will be used ""wherever we need it."" 
Yigal Carmon, the founder and president of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), predicted the outbreak of the Iran-backed war in a late August article titled ""Signs Of Possible War In September-October."" 
Carmon, a former counter-terrorism adviser to two Israeli Prime Ministers, wrote, ""There has also been an increase in efforts by Iran and Hezbollah to smuggle weapons into the West Bank, similar to the smuggling of weapons into Gaza.""

Hezbollah is a U.S.-designated Lebanese terrorist movement responsible for the mass murder of hundreds of Americans. 
Carmon wrote, ""There have recently been increasing reports about the potential use of new weapons by Hezbollah, Hamas and the PIJ that can cause a large number of Israeli fatalities, such as extra-powerful explosive charges and rockets fired on Israeli localities, as mentioned above. In this situation, Israel will likely be compelled to undertake a large-scale response, above and beyond its routine counter-terrorism measures, even at the cost of an all-out war."" 
Carmon continued that the Iranian-regime controlled PIJ ""secretary-general Ziad Al-Nakhaleh said that, during his June 2023 meeting with Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei, the latter had ‘reiterated [the need to] develop the arming of the West Bank and the resistance there."" 
Nakhaleh added: ""We, as Palestinians and as resistance forces and movements, understand the importance of arming the West Bank, but this requires efforts by the Palestinians themselves, and also the assistance of our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran."" 
All of this helps to explain Iran’s laser-like focus on creating multiple war fronts against the tiny Jewish state.

The former Israeli counter-terrorism official, Carmon, told Fox News Digital that Hamas’s war is aimed ""to prevent normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia"" with respect to diplomatic relations.  
Brigadier General (Res) Amir Avivi, a former deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces' Gaza Division, told Fox News Digital that ""Iran funds Hamas by tens of millions of dollars per month. Hamas is an Iranian proxy that dominates the Gaza Strip and is acting in accordance to its instructions, in particular since Hamas' number two Saleh Aruri became a much more dominant figure in the organization."" 
Avivi added: ""Iran sees Saudi Arabia and other pragmatic Sunni countries begin to normalize relations with Israel and seeks to strengthen the Iranian-Hamas-Hezbollah axis around the Middle East. Hezbollah made a statement calling Arab countries to stop normalization efforts. That is why we have to unite behind the Israeli-American-pragmatic Sunni bloc and defeat terrorism wherever it acts. Iran provides Hamas with ammunition, training and equipment, including smuggling through the Rafah tunnels and training inside Iran.""

Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz blamed Tehran for the war against Israel, writing on X (formerly known as Twitter): ""Iran-controlled Hamas terrorists launched a literal war against Israel tonight. Our Israeli allies will now do what they must to defend themselves and I stand with them as they confront this violence and these atrocities. "" He added ""The United States must continue to support Israel's absolute right to self-defense and ensure it has the military resources and diplomatic support it needs to confront the genocidal Iran-controlled terrorists who seek Israel's destruction.""

American in Israel says Hamas abducting her family is a fate worse than death,2023-10-12,Fox News,['Teny Sahakian'],"Abbey Onn, an American whose family lives in Israel, talks about realizing her loved ones were abducted by terrorists and how she maintains hope for their return.
An American whose family was taken hostage by Hamas said their abduction — rather than their death — is ""the worse of two evils.""
Abbey Onn, who's lived in Israel for eight years, had no idea what had happened to her five loved ones living near the Gaza border after the terror group, Hamas, invaded their community, Nir Oz, Saturday morning. 
""The last messages we saw [was] around 11 or 12 in the morning saying they don't know what's going on and that they're scared,"" Onn told Fox News, ""and from one of them saying that this was a holocaust.""

After that, the messages stopped. Hours later, the Israeli Defense Forces regained control of the area and found Hamas had burned the entire community to nothing.
Over the weekend, Hamas launched thousands of rockets into Israel as hundreds of terrorists attacked on foot, breaching the barrier between Gaza and Israel and massacring civilians in nearby areas. In response, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a ""complete siege"" on Gaza, dropping bombs on over 2,300 ""Hamas targets.""
Hamas killed over 1,200 people in Israel, including 22 Americans. Israel's retaliation has killed over 1,000 in Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities.
""It was so much chaos. I think that it's still chaos,"" Onn said. ""Managing to find out who was alive and who wasn't, wasn't something that that took a matter of hours.""
Five of her family members lived in a house together in the community: her cousin Carmela Dan, 80; Dan’s son-in-law, Ofer Kalderon, 50; and three grandchildren Sahar Kalderon, 16; Erez Kalderon, 12; and Noya Dan, 13. Onn didn't know if they were among the dead.
""It wasn't until we saw the video that Hamas uploaded of Erez in their hands being dragged along with them that we understood that they had been taken hostage,"" she said.

Hamas is believed to have taken up to 150 hostages since their weekend attack. 
Realizing Hamas abducted her family offered Onn little relief. 
""I think it's the worse of two evils,"" she said.
Her fears were compounded when Hezbollah, an Iran-backed terrorist group based in Lebanon, went on the offensive against Israel days after Hamas’s attack. 
Though separate groups, Hezbollah congratulated Hamas for its strike on Israel and launched anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military position in a northern town on the Israel-Lebanon border.

""I'm concerned about everything,"" Onn told Fox News. ""I think that I'm trying to operate on adrenaline and not think too deeply about things that are beyond my control, the military and the government.""
The U.S. and other Western allies have warned Hezbollah not to get involved and escalate the war.
""Let me say again, to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of the situation, I have one word: Don’t. Don’t,"" President Biden said Tuesday. ""Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear.""
Onn said she believes Biden’s message will stick.

""At some point people will listen, that they should not get involved, that it would be a massive mistake,"" she said. ""But as a mother of three children, of course, I am afraid. I would be stupid not to be.""
Despite Hamas’ threats and Hezbollah attacking Israel on a second front, Onn maintains hope that the international community will save her family.
""We as an international community should stand up against terror,"" she said. ""I think that everyone that has a voice needs to raise it and speak out and ask for these hostages to be brought back.""

Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and vigils have taken place in several major U.S. cities following Hamas' deadly surprise attack on Saturday that's led to at least 1,200 Israelis killed and many others taken as hostages, including soldiers, women, children and older civilians. The Israeli government declared war against Hamas and begun an assault on Gaza in response, killing at least 1,400 in the territory, according to Palestinian authorities. 
Many college campuses have held demonstrations for the Israel-Hamas war, including hundreds who gathered for a protest led by UMass Amherst students to support justice in Palestine on Thursday. The flyer posted on social media for the event told students to meet outside the college’s student union to stand in solidarity with Palestinians ""breaking out of their open air prison.""

Some Pro-Palestinian protesters could be heard chanting, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" – a chant that the Anti-Defamation League notes can be understood as a call for the elimination of Israel.

CIA reminds staff about social media posts after CIA officer shares pro-Palestinian image,2023-11-29,Fox News,"['Jake Gibson', 'Chris Pandolfo']","FOX News contributor Leo Terrell tells ‘The Story’ that President Biden and the Democrats are in a difficult situation with two opposing sides within the party.
An internal reminder of agency policy went out to Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) staff Wednesday about social media posts that could be construed as political, Fox News has confirmed. 
This internal reminder came after reports surfaced that a senior CIA officer had posted a pro-Palestinian image on social media two weeks after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.  
In a statement to Fox News, the CIA said its officers are committed to ""analytic objectivity."" 
""CIA officers may have personal views, but this does not lessen their — or CIA’s — commitment to unbiased analysis,"" the agency said.

The CIA has not denied the authenticity of the pro-Palestinian image first reported by the Financial Times. Several former CIA officials who spoke to the outlet raised concerns that the senior official's post demonstrated bias that could undermine the agency. 
According to the Financial Times, the CIA's associate deputy director for analysis changed her Facebook cover photo on October 21 to an image of a man waving a Palestinian flag. The image has been used in several articles posted online that are critical of Israel.

In another post, the official reportedly published a selfie with a sticker saying ""Free Palestine"" superimposed on the photograph. The Financial Times reported that a person familiar with the image said it was posted to Facebook years ago, long before the renewed war between Israel and Hamas. 
""The officer is a career analyst with extensive background in all aspects of the Middle East and this post was not intended to express a position on the conflict,"" the source familiar told the Financial Times. 
BIDEN OFFICIALS REBEL AGAINST PRESIDENT ON ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR, SIGN DISSENT LETTER
A separate source familiar with the pro-Palestinian posts told Fox News Digital that there were also posts by the same CIA officer taking a stand against antisemitism. 
The senior official's social media posts were reportedly taken down after the Financial Times published its report. 
The official, who has not been named due to concerns for their safety, reportedly holds an important role in the CIA and has previously overseen the production of the President's Daily Brief, a compilation of highly classified intelligence the president receives most days.

The controversy over the post comes after hundreds of Biden administration staffers signed a letter opposing President Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. 
The letter, signed by 400 officials from the State Department, White House, National Security Council and the Justice Department, urged Biden to demand a cease-fire in Gaza, which the president has opposed in favor of temporary pauses in fighting. Additionally, dozens of State Department staffers reportedly wrote an internal memo condemning the administration's public stance towards Israel.

Coverage for this event has ended.
Israel Defense Forces said an airstrike killed Madhath Mubashar, the commander of Hamas' Western Khan Yunis battalion.
Mubasher is accused of taking part in explosives and sniper attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilian communities.
""Furthermore, the IDF struck 250+ Hamas targets including a terrorist tunnel network in Gaza that detonated the secondary explosions,"" the IDF said.


Damage was reported in two Egyptian cities after they were hit by projectiles on Friday, according to Reuters.
Egyptian security forces told the outlet that Taba, which is near the Israel border, and Nuweiba experienced explosions. The country's state-linked Al-Qahera News reported that the explosion in Taba appeared to come from a missile launched during the 
ongoing war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza, which is about 137 miles away.
Six people were injured in Taba, according to Egypt's health ministry, after an ambulance facility and residential building were hit. Four of the six have already been discharged from the hospital.
Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari acknowledged the incident during a Friday briefing, saying:
""In the last few hours, an aerial threat was detected in the Red Sea area. Fighter jets were launched towards the threat, and this matter is currently under investigation. In our understanding, the damage caused in Egypt originates from this threat. Israel will work together with Egypt
 and the US and tighten the defense in the region against threats in the Red Sea area.""

The number of hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists has risen to 229, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari said Friday afternoon.

Friday's number is five more than the 224 hostages reported on Thursday and the number is likely to change as various operations continue to unfold, Hagari said.
Since Hamas began taking hostages during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, only four have been released from custody – a mother-daughter duo from the Chicago area and two elderly Israeli women.
Hagari said the IDF is investing all of its efforts into its top priority of bringing the hostages home safely.




Melissa Weiss, executive editor of Jewish Insider, joined Trace Gallagher on ""FOX News @ Night"" from Jerusalem Thursday to discuss the unedited footage of Hamas' terror attack launched on Israel on Oct. 7.

Weiss, who was one of approximately 200 journalists allowed to view the footage in a private setting hosted by the Israel Defense Forces, described it as ""atrocious"" and ""shocking.""
""I think it was crucial to watch. You have to remember there are roughly 2,000 foreign journalists on the ground covering this war. Many of them have not been to Israel before. Many of them are not familiar with Hamas. So, for them, viewing this footage was an eye-opening experience,"" Weiss said. ""They could not believe that Hamas was capable of this.""
""When you look at this conflict, Hamas is not playing on the same level of morality as Israel and, frankly, as most of the world,"" Weiss said, adding that the things she saw will stay with her forever.


Israel launched a second brief incursion into Gaza overnight Thursday, Fox News correspondents reported from Tel Aviv Friday morning.
The Israel Defense Forces said Hamas terrorist targets were struck by ground troops, fighter jets and unmanned aerial vehicles over the past 24 hours. There were no injuries reported by the Israeli military and the troops were quickly out of the area.
Targets hit by the IDF include anti-tank missile launch sites, command and control centers, and Hamas operatives, according to the force.
The brief ground incursion mostly impacted the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of the northern Gaza Strip, according to Fox News' Mike Tobin, and marked the second consecutive night of such operations ahead of a looming invasion.
“I think preparation of the battlefield is the precise word to use there. That’s what we are getting from the Israelis,” Tobin reported from Tel Aviv at 10 a.m. Friday.

American forces in Iraq and Syria were attacked three times on Thursday, according to Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder.
""We're tracking that there were three attacks today, so it's now at 19 attacks, and again, we'll continue to update those numbers as new information comes in,"" Ryder said Thursday evening.

Since Oct. 17, there have been 19 attacks against American personnel in Iraq and Syria, including the three on Thursday, by a mix of one-way attack drones and rockets, the Department of Defense said.
Though specific groups responsible for the attacks were not named, Ryder said they ""are affiliated with Iran.""
At least 21 service members have been injured in the attacks, but all have returned to duty, according to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. One U.S. civilian contractor died after experiencing a cardiac incident while sheltering from the attacks.
Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., denounced a picture posted on X, formerly Twitter, showing ""Free Palestine"" written across a wall at a school in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, a predominantly Jewish community where the Tree of Life Synagogue is also located.
Fetterman described the picture, allegedly depicting an exterior wall at Allerdice High School, as ""reprehensible.""

""This is reprehensible,"" the senator wrote on X. ""The only thing that belongs on a wall right now is this.""


His post then included a picture of the wall outside his office in Washington, D.C., which shows an American flag and dozens of flyers with information on people who have been kidnapped by Hamas following its Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
An antisemitic attack took place at the Tree of Life Synagogue on Oct. 27, 2018, when a gunman opened fire on the congregation,
 leaving 11 people dead and six others wounded.


The U.S. military conducted airstrikes on two facilities in eastern Syria on Thursday in response to ongoing attacks against American military personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past week, according to the Department of Defense.

A pair of F-16s targeted two facilities – a weapons depot and an ammo storage area – near Abu Kamal used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin. It's unclear if there were any Iranian militants at the facilities when they were hit.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Thursday night that the U.S. does not seek conflict, but the ""Iranian-backed attacks"" on American forces are ""unacceptable and must stop.""
""Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them,"" Austin said. ""If attacks by Iran’s proxies against U.S. forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people.""
There have been 19 attacks against American personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17, including three additional attacks on Thursday, according to Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder. 
A U.S. contractor died from a cardiac incident while sheltering in place during the attacks and 21 American troops were injured – all of whom have since returned to duty, Austin said.




Three Tulane University students in New Orleans, Louisiana were assaulted on Thursday when pro-Palestinian protests turned violent after a man tried to stop a protester from burning an Israeli flag.
Video obtained by Fox News Digital, which was made silent due to profanity, shows a truck with a masked man in the bed holding a Palestinian flag with another man, who is unmasked, holding an Israeli flag and a lighter.
When the second man appears to begin to light the Israeli flag on fire, another man holding an Israeli flag of his own runs up to the truck and attempts to stop the act before chaos breaks out and the interventionist is assaulted by pro-Palestinian protestors.
In total, three people were assaulted after the events turned chaotic.

In a letter sent to the Tulane Community, University President Michael A. Fitts and other school administrators called the day, “deeply distressing,” stating that three Tulane students were assaulted at the rally, which was “intentionally staged” on the public sidewalk along Freret Street. The university does not have control over the public sidewalk.
“This rally was not approved or sanctioned by Tulane,” the statement read. “There were approximately 40 plainclothes and uniformed New Orleans, Tulane, Loyola and State Police officers, including mounted police, who made arrests.”
Also on hand to assist were dozens of Tulane staff members.
Last night, university police apprehended a suspect for antisemitic vandalism to a building near the campus, the statement noted, and an investigation into Thursday’s events continues, which could lead to more arrests.

“To be clear: We condemn and are outraged by today’s violence and the hateful language and rhetoric we heard,” the statement read. “It is counter to everything we stand for at Tulane. What started out as a peaceful demonstration unfortunately devolved into a violent incident and a dark day for our community.”
Many of the people involved in the protest are not affiliated with the university, administrators added, and everyone who committed an illegal act will be held accountable for their actions.
“Tulane has always found strength in our unity. We must now lean on our common humanity and the Tulane spirit to find a path forward during these challenging times,” the statement read. “We cannot prevent protests from happening on public property even at our university’s doorstep.  We can only protect and support one another as we face each new day together.”

China's Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Iran's Ali Khamenei's lead the countries described as the new ""axis of evil,"" according to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Per-Anders Pettersson/Getty Images | Contributor/Getty Images | Scott Peterson/Getty Images)

Last Friday, Zhai Jun, China’s special envoy to the Middle East announced after a meeting the day before with his Russian counterpart Mikhail Bogdanov, the Russia and China share “the same position on the Palestine question” and will work together on a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, while promoting the de-escalation of the situation.
Also last week, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping met in Beijing and called for an “immediate” cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.
In response, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY., during his Sunday TV appearances, branded China, Russia and Iran the new ""Axis of Evil,"" advocating that this ""immediate threat to the United States"" must be dealt with on an ""emergency basis.""
The Kentucky Republican implied that in the Israel-Hamas war, Russia and China, both of whom have recently deepened relations with Iran, were on the side of the terrorists.
But there are several reasons why the “Axis of Evil” badge does not fit.

While both Putin and Xi are ruthless characters, their union is rather an axis of convenience and opportunity. Their primary mission now is to outplay Washington in the Israel-Hamas war and broader conflict.
Yes, Iran is malevolent. Obsessed with the mission to destroy Israel and harm the United States, Tehran can only be dealt with by force. But neither Russia, nor China are motivated by evil when it comes to their actions on the global stage. Putin and Xi are not religious fanatics. They are pragmatic, realpolitik-minded leaders. Although authoritarians, both are focused on: first, ensuring their countries’ security – that they equate with regime survivability; and second, on shifting the balance of power in their nation’s favor and away from the West.

While Moscow and Beijing seek to defeat U.S. forces on the battlefield – in the event that Washington directly intervenes in a conflict within their perceived respective spheres of influence, such as in Taiwan or Ukraine – neither has plans to launch a devastating strike on the U.S. homeland unprovoked.

U.S. military forces are maneuvering ships throughout the Middle East to amass one of the largest collections of war ships in the region in decades, according to reports.
Making its way halfway across the Atlantic Ocean, the USS Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group is moving toward a group of U.S. naval ships in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. Once there, it will make its way through the Suez Canal to the Persian Gulf.

The fleet consists of the USS Gravely and USS Mason, both destroyers, and the USS Philippine Sea, a guided-missile cruiser.
The strike group was first tasked to join the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group in the Eastern Mediterranean, but it has since been issued the change of plans.
Once the fleet reaches the Persian Gulf, it will mark the first time since the evacuation of Afghanistan that a U.S. carrier strike group will operate in the Middle East.
U.S. Naval Institute (USNI) News reported that France is also sending an amphibious warship to join U.S. and U.K. forces as a deterrence to keep the war between Israel and Gaza from spreading to other parts of the region.

On Tuesday, U.S. Department of Defense spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed that the New Jersey Air National Guard's 119th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron arrived within U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, adding additional F-16 fighting Falcon Squadrons into the mix to deter further aggression in the region.
The U.S. Navy announced last week it would be sending the USS Mount Whitney to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea as tensions in the Middle East rise amid the Israel-Hamas war. The ship left Gaeta, Italy last week to join the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group.
Also in the area is a special operations capable Marine rapid response force of nearly 2,000 Marines and sailors known as the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which is moving closer to Israel via the Red Sea. The group includes the amphibious ready groups USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall.


A California city passed a controversial resolution to back Palestinians in Gaza, which some local Israeli supporters say will “only incentivize the Hamas Nazi terrorists” and “greenlight the endless attempts to kill more Jews.”

Council members of the Bay Area city of Richmond passed the measure, which states Palestinians are “currently facing a campaign of ethnic cleansing and collective punishment by the state of Israel,” in a 5-1 vote.
An hourslong public comment period leading up to the vote became heated at times, with shouting between audience members.
The resolution says the ""state of Israel is engaging in collective punishment against the Palestinian people in Gaza in response to Hamas attacks on Israel,"" naming Israel’s blockade of electricity, water and other medical supplies into the densely-populated territory.

Israel has offered to end the blockade if Hamas releases its hostages, but the Iran-backed Palestinian terrorist group has been holding firm, effectively prolonging the Palestinian people's suffering.
""Israel is now engaged in an ethnic cleansing campaign by explicitly requiring 2 million Palestinians to leave Gaza immediately or risk being bombed in their homes by the Israeli army,"" the resolution says.
The resolution also calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the safe passage of substantial humanitarian aid to Gaza and the immediate release of all Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, among other things.
In conclusion, the resolution said the City of Richmond, “opposes all existing and any future military aid to Israel.”

A New York City councilwoman who was arrested after allegedly bringing a handgun to a pro-Palestinian rally in Brooklyn earlier this month, slammed Cooper Union on social media after Jewish students were barricaded inside a library on Wednesday as pro-Palestinian protesters were seen harassing them.
Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, a Republican who represents the 48th District, posted on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that she had spoken with four Jewish students from Cooper Union, three of whom were inside the library on Wednesday when protesters “violently” banged on the doors.
After speaking with the students, Vernikov shared a few take-aways regarding the incident.

Although the rally was intended to be outside the school on public property, she said, the protesters “stormed” the library and there were no consequences for it.
Another take-away was that faculty members canceled classes and encouraged students to participate, offering extra credit, the councilwoman was told by students, and some faculty members even participated in the walk out.
When it came to security, Vernikov learned from students there were not enough security guards on site, and the New York City Police Department did not show up right away. When they did, students alleged, NYPD told students the college did not allow officers on school grounds because Cooper Union is a private school.
“Some of the protesters were acting violent, held antisemitic posters, as well as what looked like sticks,” she said. “Instead of removing protesters from school grounds, the school barricaded the Jewish students in the school library.”

Vernikov added that the Jewish students in the library were “terrified” and “shaken,” fearing that they could have been physically assaulted and injured.
The students allegedly told the councilwoman one of the slogans they heard was, “Globalize the intifada from New York to Gaza,” or uprisings of Palestinians.
“This is a terrible dereliction of duty on behalf of [Cooper Union] to protect its Jewish student from physical harm, a failure to provide them with a safe space, and the university must be held accountable for creating a hostile environment,” Vernikov said. “Heads need to roll.”
Some people are now calling for university president Laura Sparks to step down.
A spokesperson for the school told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that the library was closed for 20 minutes as protesters moved through the building. Some students, the spokesperson said, were in the library and remained there when the protests moved through.

“They were accompanied by library staff and chose to stay in the library until the protest was over,” the spokesperson said. “All students, including those who participated in the protest, dispersed by 5:30 p.m. Additionally, to clarify some erroneous reports, NYPD was onsite throughout the day.”

A pro-Palestinian protest at University of Massachusetts with nearly 500 students that included a march to the Whitmore Administration Building, delivery of demands for the school’s chancellor and a sit-in resulted in the arrest of 57 protesters on Wednesday night, according to reports.
The Massachusetts Daily Collegian reported that the protests met at 2 p.m. near the Student Union before marching to the Whitmore Administration Building. While there, about 250 students went to Chancellor Javier Reyes’ office where they congregated.

At 6 p.m., the building closed, and 57 students reportedly remained inside, refusing to leave unless demands delivered to Reyes were met.
UMASS Dissenters posted the demands to Instagram, which called for the school to cut ties from weapons manufacturers that arm “Israel’s genocide” in Gaza; an immediate end to Israel’s seize on Gaza and U.S. funding for Israel; and for the school to replace weapons’ manufacturers with jobs working toward a demilitarized future.
The protests reportedly lasted until 2 a.m. and videos of the night showed a hoard of people chanting things like, “No more money for Israel’s crimes,” “Palestine will be free,” and “Free, free Palestine.”
Police officers were called names like, “Pigs,” and as each of the protesters who sat inside the building were escorted out, they each yelled their names. One girl could be heard shouting that she was being arrested for protesting genocide.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claims to have eliminated three senior Hamas operatives who played a “significant role” in the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel.
The IDF announced the news, which was based on IDF and Israel Securities Authority (ISA) intelligence, in a post on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

“Based on precise IDF and ISA intelligence, IDF fighter jets struck 3 senior Hamas operatives in the Daraj Tuffah Battalion,” the post reads. “The battalion’s operatives played a significant role in the invasion and murderous attack against Israel on Oct. 7, and is considered to be the most significant brigade of the Hamas terrorist organization.”
The war between Israel and the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas is now in its third week. At least 5,700 people have been reported killed in the war on both sides, including at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 32 Americans. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claims at least 4,385 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and the West Bank and more than 13,561 wounded.

Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, spoke during an emergency meeting pertaining to the Israel-Hamas war on Thursday, telling those in attendance that his country was not at war with humans, but instead were “at war with monsters.”
During the emergency meeting, held by the UN’s General Assembly and expected to last two days, Erdan shared stories while showing pictures and videos of the heinous acts committed by Hamas on innocent civilians.
In one video, a terrorist is seen trying to behead a victim.

“I have seen much footage over the past weeks that will be seared into my mind forever, but there is one sight that I keep seeing when I try to sleep,” Erdan said. “In the video, one can see a terribly injured civilian – bloodied, yet alive – laying on the ground as a Hamas savage screaming Allahu Akbar repeatedly pummels the man’s neck with a garden hoe in order to decapitate him.”
Erdan said the victim was not Israeli or Jewish, but instead was an agricultural worker from Thailand, merely trying to make a living for him and his family.
“But he was decapitated with a blunt gardening tool,” the ambassador said. “Horrifying! Israel is not at war with human beings, we are at war with monsters.”
Erdan shared photos of Israeli victims burned alive, raped, and butchered by Hamas terrorists.
He said the attack on Oct. 7 was conducted by “Barbaric Hamas terrorists” who came with the sole purpose of “savagely” murdering every living thing in their path.

“They brutally murdered civilians in their beds. They drove pickup trucks with machine guns – yes, just like ISIS – and fired blindly at hundreds of young people at a concert,” Erdan said. “The savages tortured small babies. Just like the Nazis, Hamas terrorists removed infants from their cribs and swung them repeatedly against the ground until their skulls became a pulp. Children were murdered in front of their parents. And parents in front of their children.""
The UN is expected to vote on a resolution introduced by Jordan – which does not condemn or even mention Hamas.

“They write a resolution completely devoid of any content related to the situation, they assume that you have already forgotten who it is that is responsible for the inhuman violence, and they just expect you to support it,” Erdam told the General Assembly. “This resolution is a disgrace to your intelligence. It is unfathomable that such a resolution – one that doesn’t even mention Hamas – could possibly be voted upon.""

U.S. Department of Defense spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Thursday that 900 troops have been deployed, or are in the process of deploying to the Central Command area in the Middle East.

Ryder said the troops heading to the region have been on “prepare to deploy” orders, and are deploying from the continental U.S.
The units include a high-altitude area defense battery from Fort Bliss, Texas; Patriot batteries from Fort Sill, Oklahoma; the Patriot and Avenger batteries from Fort Liberty, North Carolina, and their associated air defense headquarters, which are elements from Fort Bliss and Fort Calvados, Texas.
Ryder would not say where the units were being deployed to, but confirmed they are not going to Israel.
“Again, they are intended to support regional deterrence efforts and further bolster U.S. force protection capabilities,” Ryder said.
He also said between Oct. 17 and 18, 21 service members received minor injuries during drone attacks at al-Asad Air Base in Iraq and al-Tanf Garrison in Syria.

At al-Tanf, there were 17 U.S. service members who were injured, 15 of whom were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, or TBI. Four service members were injured at al-Asad, and also diagnosed with TBI.
All 21 members have returned to duty.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned the U.S. that it would not be spared if it continues to manage what he called the “genocide in Palestine,” while speaking to the United Nations on Thursday.
“Today in New York and the United Nations, I say frankly to the American statemen who are now managing the genocide in Palestine that we do not welcome the expansion of the war in the region,” Amir-Abdollahian said. “But I warn, if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire. It is our home and West Asia is our region.”
He continued by saying his country does not compromise with any party or side and does not have reservations when it comes to the country’s security.

Amir-Abdollahian directed comments to President Biden, saying Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners, then added that the world should support the release of 6,000 Palestinians who are also held as prisoners, though in Israel.
“In addition, why the United States itself is actually and in practice and directly involved in committing crimes against Palestinians, it is not in a position to invite others to exercise self-restraint and refrain from spreading the war,” the foreign minister said. “Therefore, we strongly warn against the uncontrollable consequences of the unlimited financial arms and operational support by the White House to the Tel Aviv regime, which have led to the expansion and added to the severity of the bombardments of the civilians and the Palestinian women and children in Gaza and the West Bank.”

The U.S. and Qatar have agreed to negotiate Hamas’ status in Doha, after the hostage crisis has been resolved, according to a source familiar with the situation.
The Washington Post was first to report about the agreement.
At this time, the source says, there is no specific plan on how to resolve Hamas’ office in Doha, or whether Qatar will expel Hamas.
The deal was struck between the two countries two weeks ago in Doha when Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Sheikh Tamin Bin Hamad al-Thani.
Hamas has an office in the Qatari capital, and officials in Qatar have been acting as intermediaries to negotiate with Hamas to release hostages.

White House says Gaza health ministry is 'a front for Hamas,' again denies Palestinian casualty data

White House National Security Council
 spokesman John Kirby doubled down on President Biden's rejection of casualty data coming from the Hamas-run Gaza healty ministry on Thursday.
Kirby made the statement in response to questions from reporters at a Thursday press briefing at the White House. He described the health ministry as a ""front for Hamas"" and rejected its claim that more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7.
""We all know that the Gaza ministry of health is nothing more than a front for Hamas,"" Kirby said. ""It's run by Hamas, a terrorist organization. I've said it myself up here--we can't take anything coming out of Hamas, including the so-called ministry of health, at face value.""
Kirby went on to say that the number of casualties in Gaza is likely in the thousands, however.
Biden first stated he had ""no confidence"" in the Hamas data on Wednesday.
A reporter had asked whether Hamas' statistics suggest that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is ignoring U.S. calls to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.
""What they say to me is that I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,"" Biden responded. ""I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's a price of waging a war.""
""I think we should be incredibly careful – not we – the Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against Israel. It's against their interests when that doesn't happen, but I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using,"" he added.

Muslims warn Democrats they'll lose their votes over Israel support: 'Going to have a problem'

Some Muslims in Michigan feel ""betrayed"" by how Democrats have responded to the Israel-Hamas war, and are warning party leaders they might not back the party in 2024, the Associated Press reported.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and other Democrats in the state angered some Arab Americans for attending a pro-Israel rally days after the coordinated terror attack from Hamas earlier this month, but not attending a pro-Palestinian rally in Dearborn, the following day. Dearborn is one of the largest Muslim and Arab-American communities in the country.
At that rally, Whitmer and party leaders in the state were reportedly called out and booed for not attending.
Some Arab Americans told the AP this gesture, along with President Biden's support of Israel, could cost Democrats in the next election.
""There is going to be an effort to not support the people who have not supported us. The people that we voted for such a long time — people that we’ve helped, we’ve donated to and we’ve worked on their campaigns,"" 22-year-old Palestinian American Adam Abusalah said.

Democratic state Rep. Alabas Farhat said that in 2024, the party would have to answer for the way they've treated Arab Americans and Palestinians in this conflict.
""In 2024, Democrats are going to have a problem with Arab Americans. For too long, they’ve isolated Arab American voices within the party. They’ve isolated the perspectives of Arab Americans. And on this specific issue, they’ve denied even recognizing the human rights of Palestinians,"" Farhat, whose district contains most of Dearborn, told the AP.

New York City Jews warned to stay away from 'Flood Brooklyn for Gaza' protest: Report


Jews in New York City are reportedly being encouraged to stay away from an upcoming ""Flood Brooklyn for Gaza"" protest, according to local outlet Col Live.
Rabbi Chanina Sperlin of the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council told the outelt that the NYPD has assured him that local Jews ""will be protected."" The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.
“Jews should definitely avoid the area,” a police source reportedly told the outlet. ""There’s no intel at this time in which direction the protest will head. Locals should definitely stay away from Eastern Parkway in that area.""
Jewish community leaders remain confident in police's ability to manage the protest, however.

Rabbi Yaacov Behrman of Jewish Future Alliance told Col that the NYPD did an ""excellent job"" of managing a pro-Palestinian rally last week that featured some 5,000 attendees. Nevertheless, Behrman said residents shoudl ""stay vigilant and avoid that area unless absolutely necessary.""
The Brooklyn protest comes as pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas demonstrations have popped up across the U.S., Europe and the globe. University students across America have shouted pro-Hamas slogans, leading to widespread fear among Jewish students.

Israel eliminates top Hamas intelligence official who planned Oct. 7 attack in Gaza airstrike


Israeli Defense Forces say they eliminated a top Hamas intelligence official in an airstrike in Gaza on Thursday.
Israel identified the official as Shadi Barud, deputy head of Hamas' Intelligence Directorate. He is one of several senior Hamas officials to be killed in Gaza in recent days.
""Shadi Barud, Deputy Head of Hamas’ Intelligence Directorate has been eliminated by an IDF aerial strike,"" the Israeli military wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. ""He took part in the planning of the October 7 massacre and countless other deadly attacks carried out against Israelis.""
""We will continue to strike and eliminate Hamas leaders and operatives responsible for the barbaric attacks,"" it added.


Israel remains poised for a full-scale invasion of northern Gaza, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says is imminent.

GOP senators introduce standalone bill to aid Israel without more funding to Ukraine

GOP Sens. Roger Marshall, Ted Cruz, JD Vance and Mike Lee introduced a standalone bill to funnel aid to Israel without tying it to Ukraine aid on Thursday.
The bill, called the Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act, is an alternative to President Biden’s $106 billion emergency supplemental bill he requested from Congress last week.

The Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act, if passed, would provide $14.3 billion to Israel, including $10.6 billion for assistance through the Department of Defense (DOD), $3.5 billion for foreign military financing and $200 million to help protect U.S. embassies and personnel.
The legislation expedites funding for Israel by allocating resources to bolster Israel's defense capabilities, specifically focusing on enhancing systems like the Iron Dome and Iron Beam, as well as replacing weapons provided by the DOD.
The bill comes in opposition to legislation proposed by Democrats and Biden, who want funding for Ukraine and Israel
 to be lopped together. Many Republicans have soured on continued support for Ukraine, which has already received over $120 billion.

Critics slam Biden admin for allowing Iran's FM to visit UN: 'blood of Americans on his hands'

The United States allowed Iran’s foreign minister
 to visit New York City this week to address the United Nations, drawing the ire of critics who insist the Biden administration should never have allowed him into the country.
""Iran-backed terrorists have attacked our servicemembers and are currently holding Americans hostage, but the Biden administration has granted a top Iranian official a visa — welcoming this regime on U.S. soil with open arms,"" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, wrote on social media platform X.

Jewish student denounces pro-Hamas messages projected on campus library: 'Absolute antisemitism'


One Jewish student at George Washington University spoke out after disturbing anti-Israel messages were projected onto the wall of the library as antisemitism continues to ferment on campuses nationwide in wake of the war against Hamas.
Sabrina Soffer said she was ""not surprised"" by the antisemitic messages projected onto the library, but explained why she still remains fearful, nonetheless, during ""The Ingraham Angle.""

""I was very shocked, but I was not surprised, and I'll tell you why,"" Soffer told Laura Ingraham Wednesday. ""I think that Jewish students have been warning of this kind of radical ideology by anti-Israel groups on campus, and this is just one extreme manifestation that they're really showing their true colors here.""
""This is absolute antisemitism, and what is happening is that there is a lot of radical ideology that's going on in the classroom where terrorism is being justified in very insidious ways, and it's very concerning,"" she continued.
""My first reaction was, 'yes, of course, I'm fearful.' Jewish students are fearful, but again, we shouldn't be surprised.""
The messages projected onto the university's library read, ""GW the blood of Palestinians is on your hands,"" and ""Your tuition is funding genocide in Gaza.""
Another message read, ""Glory to our martyrs.""

Soffer said Jewish students stopped in their tracks when they saw the messages on the library and an ongoing pro-Hamas ""vigil."" She said there was police intervention but that nothing turned violent.

Israel says Hamas terrorists keeping fuel for themselves ignoring humanitarian needs of Gazans

Even as the humanitarian situation for Gaza’s 2.1 million civilians continues to deteriorate, with the U.N. and other international aid agencies warning that fuel for hospitals and essential institutions is set to run out completely in the coming days, Israel is remaining steadfast in its refusal to allow power generating materials to enter the Palestinian enclave.

As Israel ramps up its aerial bombardments in an effort to wipe out the Hamas terrorist group following its Oct. 7 surprise attack on southern Israel, withholding fuel is part of a broader strategy of literally ""smoking out"" the terrorists who have been sequestered in the subterranean tunnel system that snake beneath the streets of the Gaza Strip. 
Ehud Ya’ari, an Israel-based Lafer international fellow of The Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital that for years, Hamas had been stealing fuel designated for civilian purposes in order to build up its stocks. 
""Underneath Gaza City, there is a deep system of tunnels that stretches for some 190 miles, and it is totally dependent on fuel for ventilation, communication, and electricity,"" he said.
Ya’ari also said that the roughly 220 hostages being held by Hamas inside Gaza since the Oct. 7 attack were likely hidden somewhere inside this vast tunnel system.
""One of the ways to flush them [Hamas] out or force them above ground is to prevent them from having fuel,"" he said, adding ""It is no vacation being in those underground tunnels for three weeks. It’s hot and humid and the more Israel destroys of Hamas’ infrastructure from the air, the fewer casualties there will be for Israel on the ground.""
""This is a key strategy and that is why the Israelis have been insisting that fuel is not to be included in the aid trucks going into Gaza from Egypt,"" Ya’ari added. 

‘Shaking from fear:’ Israeli Father recounts miracles that saved family during Hamas's massacre

A father of three girls said it's a miracle most of his family survived Hamas’ massacre on Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel.
""Every time I looked inside at my daughters, I couldn’t believe that somebody was going to kill them,"" Mati Dancyg told Fox News. ""I thought that eventually they will come to our house.""
Almost half of Kibbutz Nir Oz’s 400 residents were murdered or taken captive during Hamas’s brutal Oct. 7 attack, reported The New York Times.
Dancyg’s believes his father and beloved 75-year-old Yad Vashem Holocaust educator, Alex Dancyg, is believed to be a hostage in Gaza.
""They started slaughtering people and burning houses,"" Dancyg said. ""I was very, very terrified, and I was shaking from fear.""
""In some kind of a miracle way, they didn’t get inside,"" he continued.
Dancyg said he tried to keep his family as calm as possible by giving his young daughters — ages 2, 7 and 8 — toys and filtering the news reports he shared with his wife.
""I’m glad they didn’t get very, very traumatized,"" he said. ""I didn’t tell my wife exactly what was going on because I wanted her to stay calm with the daughters.""

The United Nations is holding an emergency session to address Israel's retaliatory war against Hamas on Thursday and Friday.
The U.N. has so far failed to address the conflict, with Russia and China vetoing a resolution on the issue from the U.S. on Wednesday. The two-day session that began Thursday will open with a speech by the Palestinians after which Israel’s Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan will deliver remarks, followed by the Ambassador of Jordan and the Foreign Minister of Iran.
Israel has already condemned a resolution put forward by Jordan, calling hit ""biased and distorted.""
""[The resolution] completely ignores the existence of Hamas and does not mention the terror organization or the barbaric massacre it committed,"" Israel's mission to the U.N. said in a statement. ""The one-sided proposal, which is disconnected from reality, calls for an immediate ceasefire and does not refer at all to the firing of missiles and rockets at Israel or Israel's right to defend itself.""
The session will vote on Jordan's resolution on Friday.


Former NBA Star Enes Kanter-Freedom blasted Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for claiming that Hamas is not a terrorist organization on thursday.
Kanter-Freedom appeared on Fox Business with host Maria Bartiromo on Thursday morning to discuss Erdogan's comments. Erdogan has accused Israel
 of deliberately targeting civilians and called the war against Hamas a ""premeditated act of crime against humanity.""
Kanter-Freedom says he first thought that headlines about Erdogan's comments were ""fake, Onion news,"" referring to a satirical news outlet.
""I couldn't believe my ears. And Turkey is supposed to be a NATO ally,"" he said. ""I cannot imaging an organization like Hamas or Hezbollah getting so much support from countries like Iran and Turkey.""
He went on to accuse Turkey of supporting terrorist groups and even providing some with passports.

Israeli military releases footage of air strike that killed senior Hamas commander


Israeli Defense Forces released footage of an air strike they say killed senior Hamas commander Hassan Al-Abdullah on Thursday.
The footage, apparently taken from an Israeli jet, shows several airstrikes in Gaza. Israel conducted some 250 such strikes on Hamas targets over just 24 hours on Thursday.
""IDF fighter jets carried out a precise air strike based on IDF and ISA intelligence and eliminated the Commander of Hamas' Northern Khan Yunis Rockets Array, Hassan Al-Abdullah,"" the IDF wrote in a statement.



Al-Abdullah is only the latest senior commander Israeli forces have killed, and he is unlikely to be the last. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that all Hamas members involved in the October 7 attack on Israel will be killed, and that Hamas itself will be ""destroyed.""

Russia, China veto American UN resolution calling for 'humanitarian pauses' in Israel-Hamas war

A U.S. resolution supporting Israel and calling for the respect for civilian life and for ""humanitarian pauses"" in the 
Israel-Hamas war failed to pass at the United Nations on Wednesday following vetos from Russia and China.
Of the 15-member Security Council, ten members voted in favor, two abstained, and three voted against. Those opposed included Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates. Despite the strong majority, the resolution failed to pass thanks to Russia and China's status as permanent members.
The U.S. resolution would have fully endorsed Israel's right to defend itself, but it would also have emphasized the protection of civilians and called for pauses in the fighting to provide aid to Gaza.

Israel has allowed some aid to flow into Gaza through the Egyptian border over the 20 days since the war began, but critics say it is not enough.

North Korea accuses Israel of 'genocide' in Gaza, labels US an 'accomplice'


North Korea is accusing Israel of masterminding the ongoing violence between themselves and Hamas — and claiming the U.S. is an accomplice.
North Korean state media accused Israel of responsibility for the recent explosion near al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in the Gaza Strip.
""What should not be overlooked is that Israel's such criminal act was openly committed under the undisguised patronage of the U.S.,"" a North Korean foreign ministry spokesperson told the Korean Central News Agency.

""Immediately after the bombing of the hospital by Israel, the U.S. covered such crime, making absurd sophism that the incident seemed to be committed by other forces rather than Israel,"" the North Korean spokesperson continued. ""This shows that the U.S. is an accomplice who connived at and fostered Israel's genocide.""
Hamas has claimed Israel was behind the Oct. 17 explosion that killed hundreds of people, but the source of the rocket has been disputed.
President Biden has asserted intelligence networks' belief that the explosion was caused by a misfired rocket from Gaza militants themselves.


The U.S. military is bolstering its capabilities in the Middle East as it prepares for a potential escalation in Israel's retaliatory war against Hamas on Thursday.
The Pentagon is reportedly rushing to deploy air defenses around bases in the Middle East as Israel appears poised for a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip.
 U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria have already faced over a dozen drone and rocket attacks in the past week, resulting in more than 20 injuries.
President Biden has warned that Iran and Hezbollah must not intervene in Israel's campaign against Hamas, as such an intervention would drastically widen the conflict.
The U.S. has deployed two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Eastern Mediterranean in a clear message of support for Israel. Secretary of State Tony Blinken has said the U.S. will not hesitate to intervene on Israel's behalf if it is necessary.

The Swedish government is granting more funds to its Jewish community to bolster their security as antisemitic incidents spike across the globe.
Pro-Palestinian and Pro-Hamas rallies have popped up in Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere as Israel prosecutes its retaliatory war against Hamas in Gaza. The Swedish governmet granted 10 million Swedish kronor, or just under $900,000, to the Official Council of Swedish Jewish Communities on Wednesday.
Sweden says the funds are to be used to improve security at Synagogues, schools and other Jewish organizations.
Meanwhile, American Jews studying in Israel say they are outraged by what they see as a rise of antisemitism back home in the United States following the worst terrorist attack in the history of the Jewish state.

CAIR demands apology after Biden dismisses Hamas-provided casualty numbers in Gaza

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned President Biden for stating that he has ""no confidence"" in Hamas-provided data on casualties in Gaza on Wednesday.
CAIR wrote that it is ""deeply disturbed and shocked"" by Biden's comments, made during a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claims that more than 6,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's war on Hamas since October 7.

""The Israeli government has openly admitted that it is targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. Journalists have confirmed the high number of casualties, and countless videos coming out of Gaza every day show mangled bodies of Palestinian women and children – and entire city blocks leveled to the ground. President Biden should watch some of these videos and ask himself if the crushed children being dragged out of the ruins of their family homes are a fabrication or an acceptable price of war. They are neither,"" CAIR wrote in a statement.
On Wednesday, a reporter asked Biden whether Hamas' statistics suggest that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
 is ignoring U.S. calls to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.
""What they say to me is that I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,"" Biden responded. ""I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's a price of waging a war.""
""I think we should be incredibly careful – not we – the Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against Israel. It's against their interests when that doesn't happen, but I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using,"" he added.

Hamas members are blocking roads and 'shooting at people' who try to flee south, Gaza resident says


Hamas terrorists continue to block roads and prevent civilians in Northern Gaza from fleeing to the south as Israel has urged them to do.
Israeli Defense Forces released a recording they say is of an Israeli intelligence officer speaking with a Gaza resident. The officer urges the resident to flee south toward Khan Yunis, but the resident says that is not possible due to Hamas roadblocks.
""I'm an officer from the IDF, to ensure your personal safety, I'm asking you to head towards Khan Yunis immediately,"" the officer says in the recording.
""All the roads are blocked,"" the resident says. ""They're just sending people back home...they are shooting at people.""



Israel arrests dozens of Hamas targets in West Bank raids

Israeli Defense Forces say they made 60 arrests in the West Bank during raids on Thursday, with 46 of the arrestees being members of Hamas.
Israel's West Bank raid came around the same time it conducted its largest-yet incursion into the Gaza Strip early Thursday. Since the start of the war on Oct. 7, about 1,000 wanted individuals have been arrested, the IDF says.
The West Bank has been th esite of many widespread protests against Israel's war against Hamas.

Israel says the incursion is only a preamble for the ""next stages of combat,"" an apparent hit at a larger scale invasion.
Israeli forces have been encamped around Gaza for more than a week, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Hamas will be ""destroyed"" by the end of the conflict.

Israel says overnight incursion was only preparation for 'next stages of combat'

The Israeli military says its overnight incursion into Gaza--the largest incursion of the war so far--was only in preparation for ""the next stages of combat.""
Israeli Defense Forces made the statement online early Thursday, hours after the brief, but expansive incursion ended. Footage of the assault shows Israeli tanks firing as they move near a Gaza border zone.
""The soldiers have since exited the area and returned to Israeli territory,"" the military statement added.

Israel began localised ground incursions on Sunday as the war, triggered by an Oct 7 cross-border rampage by Hamas gunmen, entered its third week. Israel's Army Radio described Thursday's incursion as the biggest yet.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to ""destroy"" Hamas, saying a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip is imminent.
Reuters contributed to this report.


The Israeli military conducted its largest incursion into Gaza of the war so far early Thursday after a bombardment on 250 terrorist targets over the previous 24 hours.
Israeli's military has been poised for a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza for more than a week, but leaders have hesitated to issue an order to move forward. U.S. officials had reportedly urged Israel to hold off on the attack while the U.S. places further air defenses at its bases across the Middle East, according to the Wall St. Journal.

The 224 hostages taken by Hamas during its October 7 massacre in Israel have also been a factor.


The Gold Star father of a Marine who was killed in the U.S. withdrawal from Kabul, Afghanistan, called out Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Biden for how they are handling a situation in Gaza that could lead to a similar mass evacuation of Americans.

On ""The Ingraham Angle,"" host Laura Ingraham reported on murmurs that evacuations of thousands of Americans from Middle Eastern countries could commence if the situation in the Holy Land worsens. Hamas Palestinian militants have an unclear number of Americans held hostage versus potentially deceased.
Mark Schmitz, father of LCpl. Jared Schmitz, told FOX News on Thursday that he fears the worst, given who is in charge at the White House.
""I have no faith and I don't think they've learned a single lesson from Afghanistan,"" he said. ""I mean, we still have American citizens in Afghanistan that we haven't gotten out.""

""I just wonder if Blinken is now climbing in the perch of [NSC spokesman John] Kirby where he saw no chaos,"" Schmitz said. ""You know, I think these guys are just tone-deaf.""


Fighter jets hit more than 250 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, according to Israel Defense Forces Thursday morning.

The IDF said it struck Hamas infrastructure, operational command centers, tunnel shafts and rocket launchers ""placed in the heart of civilian areas"" that have fired toward Israeli territory since the terrorist group launched its attack on Oct. 7.
In addition to the airstrikes, the Israeli navy also took down a Hamas surface-to-air missile launch post in the Khan Yunis area.""The post is located adjacent to a mosque and kindergarten, which is further proof that Hamas deliberately uses civilian sites for terror purposes,"" the IDF said.
IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari also revealed there are 224 hostages in Hamas' custody as of Thursday morning, and all families have been notified.
""The effort to release the hostages is still a high priority in any possible way,"" Hagari said.
Fox News' Yael Rotem-Kuriel contributed to this report.

Jake Novak, who formerly worked as a media director at the Israeli Consulate in New York, reported that the protestors ""barricad[ed]"" the library's exits.
""My sources tell me several Jewish students [at Cooper Union] are currently locked in the school library as a [pro] Hamas rally outside of the Cooper Union building learnt [sic] the Jews were afraid and sitting in the library, then brought the protest inside and are barricading all exits,"" he explained.
""Police have been called for 40 min and are afraid to get involved,"" Novak added. ""Security locked the students in as they are worried they cannot protect the Jews [right now].""

FBI, DHS update alert highlighting increase in 'potential threats' to US amid Hamas-Israel war


The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued an updated alert on Wednesday warning of heightened terrorism threats in the United States amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.
The announcement was made to ""highlight potential threats"" from a ""variety of actors"" following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which has emboldened foreign terrorist groups to encourage their supporters to ""foment violence in the West.""
Wednesday's bulletin reflects ""a fluid and evolving situation,"" according to the agencies, and comes as an update to the Oct. 10 and Oct. 18 announcements from the FBI, the DHS and the National Counterterrorism Center.

""The terrorism threat in the Homeland has remained heightened throughout 2023, but recent events have increased the possibility of potential attacks against individuals and institutions in response to developments in the Middle East,"" the bulletin read.
Since the initial announcement on Oct. 10, the FBI and DHS said ""the volume and frequency"" of threats against Americans, especially those in the Jewish, Arab Americans and Muslim communities, have increased, heightening concerns over reactions from ""violent extremists and ""lone offenders.""
""While we have no specific information that foreign adversaries are plotting attacks against the homeland, some are seeking to take advantage of the conflict, calling for violence in furtherance of their respective goals,"" the agencies wrote.

The bulletin noted a few instances over the past two weeks of terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida and ISIS, using their media publications to call for attacks against Americans and Jewish communities.
A warning was also issued about mis- and dis-information circulated online by Iranian media outlets ""that risk deepening resentment and evoking strong emotional responses among English-speaking audiences"" in relation to the Israel-Hamas conflict.

""These outlets are utilizing verifiably doctored or mislabeled images and video footage, inaccurate translations, and misleading content about the conflict with the apparent intent to stoke passions, accelerate the process of radicalization, and lead individuals to engage in targeted violence,"" the bulletin said.
Americans at home and abroad are urged to remain vigilant and to report threats of violence and suspicious activity to authorities.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., was delivering a speech Monday when a group of pro-Palestinian protesters attempted to drown him out, demanding a cease-fire in Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza. 
""I want to call out to everybody right now. These final hours. This is what’s on the ballot,"" Booker began his speech. ""We should know in New Jersey how privileged we are. There are so many places in our country right now … where people want to make sure… that we have…"" 
""Cease-fire now,"" the crowd repeatedly chanted, interrupting Booker’s speech ahead of Election Day.
""This is what makes America great,"" Booker interjected. ""The power to protest. The power to have free speech. The power of America."" 
As the chants continued and grew louder, the venue began playing ""We Are Family,"" the 1979 song by Sister Sledge, over clamors of ""cease-fire now"" that persisted from the demonstrators.

The Gaza Strip - or Gaza - is a 140-square-mile piece of land along the Mediterranean Sea between Egypt and Israel. It is comprised of the cities Rafah, Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah, Jabalia, Al-Nazlah and Gaza.
The Egyptians previously occupied the Gaza Strip by way of military rule from 1949 to 1956 and again from 1957 to 1967. The Israelis assumed occupation over the strip in 1967 during the Six Day War beginning with an airstrike that destroyed the Egyptian air force. The conflict began on June 5, 1967 and ended on June 10, resulting in Israel's possession of The Holy Basin including the Old City of Jerusalem and Gaza as well as the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Israeli forces recaptured areas near the Gaza Strip that had been overrun in a Hamas mass-infiltration over the weekend. ( )

The Gaza Strip, where millions of Palestinians presently reside, was later seized by Hamas, an Iranian-backed terrorist group that brutally opposes Israel's existence.
Violence between Israelis and Palestinians has occurred for years not exclusively to Israel, but also in Gaza and the West Bank, killing thousands of civilians in years past.
Hamas, classified as a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department, has brutalized and killed thousands of civilians, including several Americans, during a surprise attack on Israel the morning of Oct. 7, firing rockets from the Gaza Strip. The sound of rocket launches could be heard in Gaza as residents reported armed clashes along the separation fence with Israel, near the southern town of Khan Younis.

""In preparation for the next stages of combat, the IDF operated in northern Gaza. IDF tanks & infantry struck numerous terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts. The soldiers have since exited the area and returned to Israeli territory,"" the IDF wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
When asked by Trace Gallagher on ""Fox News @ Night"" if the ground incursions are taking place on a regular basis, Tomlinson responded by saying this particular mission appeared to be a ""major operation.""
""Definitely haven't seen anything this large so far in the 19, now 20, day-old war,"" Tomlinson said.
Fox News' Trey Yingst reported from Israel Thursday at around noon local time that the Israeli military is still expected ""to launch a full-scale invasion"" in the near future as airstrikes increased into Gaza overnight.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also reiterated Wednesday that the ground invasion is not a matter of if, but when, Yingst said.

Yingst also reported that the International Legal Forum, an Israel-based NGO, filed a formal complaint with the International Criminal Court calling for an immediate investigation into war crimes committed during Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack on the Jewish State.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is calling out the White House for allowing a high-ranking Iranian official in the U.S. amid Tehran's possible support of Hamas attacks against Israel.
Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian arrived in New York on Wednesday night to attend a United Nations session, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.

Iran has been heavily criticized by Israel supporters for possibly being linked to the Hamas attacks of October 7, in addition to having a previous history of supporting Hamas.
""Iran-backed terrorists have attacked our servicemembers and are currently holding Americans hostage,"" Ernst wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""But the Biden administration has granted a top Iranian official a visa — welcoming this regime on U.S. soil with open arms.""
""The appeasement must end,"" the Iowa senator added.


Social media video shows Jewish students at Cooper Union in New York City locked inside a school library while a pro-Palestinian rally moved through the building.
Protestors were heard banging on doors and chanting ""Free, free Palestine"" as the students sat at a table and attempted to study. Organizers were also observed holding up anti-Israel signs against the library's glass.
Jake Novak, who formerly worked as a media director at the Israeli Consulate in New York, reported that the protestors ""barricad[ed]"" the library's exits.

""My sources tell me several Jewish students [at Cooper Union] are currently locked in the school library as a [pro] Hamas rally outside of the Cooper Union building learnt [sic] the Jews were afraid and sitting in the library, then brought the protest inside and are barricading all exits,"" he explained.
""Police have been called for 40 min and are afraid to get involved,"" Novak added. ""Security locked the students in as they are worried they cannot protect the Jews [right now].""


A man in California was arrested after he allegedly broke into a Jewish family's home screaming ""Free Palestine,"" according to the LAPD.
The homeowners called police at around 5:30 a.m. Wednesday and told them that they were hiding in a room with their four kids. In a second call, the Jewish homeowners explained that the suspect was threatening to kill them because of their religious identities.
When police arrived to arrest the suspect, who was only wearing his underwear, he chanted, ""Free Palestine, free Palestine, free Palestine.""

Police have not released the identity of the assailant, who they believe may have been on drugs at the time.

The Pentagon has confirmed that 21 U.S. service members were injured in drone attacks in the Middle East, as the Israel-Hamas war continues.
Military officials previously reported that injury estimates were ""more than 20."" In a statement obtained by Fox News, a Pentagon spokesperson clarified the number.
""Between Oct. 17-18 (ET), twenty-one U.S. personnel received minor injuries due to drone attacks at Al Assad airbase, Iraq and Al-Tanf Garrison, Syria,"" the statement read. ""All members returned to duty.""
""It is important to note, in some cases service members may report injuries such as TBI several days after attacks occur, so numbers may change,"" the spokesperson added. ""We will continue to work closely with U.S. Central Command to provide updates as appropriate.""

Saudi Arabia intercepted a Houthi missile barrage towards Israel last week, Fox News can confirm.
The cruise missile was fired by Iranian-backed Houthi fighters in Yemen .The interception is the first known time that the Saudi military has intervened to prevent an attack against Israel.

It is also the fifth interception of missiles fired from Yemen. On October 19, the USS Carney intercepted 4 missiles and 15 drones.
One of the cruise missiles that was fired by Houthis had a range of approximately 1250 miles.

The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a resolution condemning the Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel on Wednesday.
The vote passed 412-10. Six members, all Democrats, voted 'present'. The resolution marked the first non-Speaker related vote by the House since October 3.

The war between Israel and Hamas terrorists has been raging since October 7, when Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed.
Roughly 222 hostages were taken from Israel into Gaza, and only four have been released.

A residential building in Rishon LeTsiyon, Israel was hit by rockets late Wednesday night, video shows.
Fox News's Alex Hogan reported from the scene in the city, which is located around five miles outside of Tel Aviv.
""Police are not yet exactly telling us what specifically struck this building behind me, but you can likely see the large gaping hole in this building,"" Hogan explained. ""This a residential building, three apartments there. There are still search and rescue teams inside trying to make sure that they have evacuated everyone.""
Hogan then explained that it was a ""terrifying sight"" for Rishon LeTsiyon residents as Hamas continues targeting civilians in its war against Israel.

""Obviously, a very terrifying moment,"" she said. ""We had heard the sirens in Tel Aviv and again, then the Iron Dome went off. Now, seeing this develop, we have seen some people come out of this home completely, completely disgruntled, frustrated and terrified.""

Russia and China have both vetoed the U.S.-backed United Nations resolution condemning Hamas's October 7 attack against Israel.

The vote took place at the United Nations Security Council meeting on Wednesday. Russia and the U.S. both drafted rival resolutions, with Russia calling for a ceasefire.
Both resolutions called for the U.N. to address humanitarian concerns in Gaza, including medical supply, food and water shortages. The Israeli military imposed a blockade on Gaza Strip after Hamas terrorists began attacking their country on October 7.
The United Nations Security Council previously rejected a draft proposal from Russia on October 16 because it failed to mention Hamas.

Critics are panning the White House for removing the Yemeni Houthis' terrorist designation in 2021, as the group continues attacking Israeli and American military assets.
The Houthis were designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in January 2021 under President Trump, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken revoked the decision the next month.

""We have listened to warnings from the United Nations, humanitarian groups, and bipartisan members of Congress, among others, that the designations could have a devastating impact on Yemenis’ access to basic commodities like food and fuel,"" Blinken explained.
""The revocations are intended to ensure that relevant U.S. policies do not impede assistance to those already suffering what has been called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis,"" the official added. ""By focusing on alleviating the humanitarian situation in Yemen, we hope the Yemeni parties can also focus on engaging in dialogue.""
Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that removing them from the list was a mistake.

""In word and in deed, the Houthis in Yemen are proving to the world their connectivity to Iran’s axis of resistance and why they should have remained on the U.S. terror list,"" Taleblu explained. ""Pulling punches and failing to hold Iran and its proxies to account, even diplomatically, shows you how far things have devolved.""
The Houthis reportedly launched drones and missiles towards Israel last week, but the USS Carney intercepted and them shot down.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has been asked to investigate Hamas for war crimes with respect to the southern Israel massacres on October 7.
The International Legal Forum (ILF), an Israel-based NGO, filed the complaint on Wednesday. According to the ILF, it is the first formal complaint about the October 7 massacres to the International Criminal Court.

In a statement, the ILF asked the Chief Prosecutor to ""initiate an urgent investigation"" into war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity committed by Hamas.
""Specific crimes alleged, include, but are not limited to: intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population, mass murder and summary executions, taking of hostages, torture, rape, use of human shields, pillaging and mutilation,"" the statement read.
""In addition to seeking the arrest warrants for the leadership of Hamas, the complaint also seeks arrest warrants against Mahmoud Abbas, in his capacity as President of the Palestinian Authority, as well as Ayatollah Khamenei of Iran and Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, Chief of the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps, arising out of their legal culpability and direct involvement in the atrocities committed on October 7th, 2023, and continuing thereafter.""

President Biden on Wednesday told reporters he has ""no confidence"" in the Palestinian death toll reported by the Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza.
The Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry claims that more than 6,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, including 2,700 children. 

""I have no notion whether Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,"" Biden said when asked about the reported death toll. ""I'm sure innocents have been killed and it's a price of waging a war.""
The president said Israel should be ""incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against Israel, and it's against our interests when that doesn't happen. But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using."" 
The Hamas-run Health Ministry claimed Wednesday that at least 6,546 Palestinians have been killed and 17,439 others wounded. In the occupied West Bank, authorities claim more than 100 Palestinians have been killed and 1,650 wounded in violence and Israeli raids since Oct. 7.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an address to his nation, promised that the delayed ground invasion of Gaza will come soon.
Netanyahu said that when the time comes, the Israeli military will ""exact the highest price from these murderers"" for the Oct. 7 terror attack in which at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. The unprecedented infiltration of Israel, the deadliest terror attack in the country's history, provoked a war that is now in its 19th day.

""We will never forget the 1,400 brothers and sisters who were slaughtered in cold blood and fought heroically to the death against these human animals, Netanyahu said, announcing there will be a national day of mourning for the victims. 
The prime minister also promised there will be an investigation into the security failures that led to Hamas catching Israel off-guard on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. 
""This failure will be investigated to the end. Everyone has to respond to that and give answers, including me, but all of this is after the war,"" Netanyahu said.


Students at George Washington University attended a pro-Palestinian vigil supporting Hamas' surprise attack that killed hundreds of Israeli civilians, that prominently projected messages on the wall of the campus' library.

Another sign read, ""GW the Blood of Palestinians is on Your Hands.""

""Your Tuition is Funding Genocide in Gaza,"" another projected sign read.
On X, the page @StopAntisemites, called for the George Washington University President Ellen Granberg to ""immediately expel those who are involved.""
The university later responded in a statement that the ""unauthorized"" messages ""violated university policy, and leadership intervened to ensure that these projections were removed.""

A U.S. defense official tells Fox News that more than 20 U.S. service members have been injured in drone and rocket attacks in the Middle East over the past week. 

The full extent of the injuries was not immediately clear. The defense official said several service members suffered from traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) but have all returned to duty.
United States-led coalition forces have started live-fire exercises at military bases in Iraq and Syria, after more than a dozen attacks on American troops over the last week. 
The Combined Joint Task Force — Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) said on Wednesday that ground operational exercises ""to validate weapons systems and maintain crew proficiency and readiness"" would happen in or near the al-Hasakah region in Syria and the Khalidiyah region in Iraq.

""On Oct. 25, 2023, Coalition service members will be conducting ground operational exercises in or near the al-Hasakah region in Syria to validate weapons systems and maintain crew proficiency and readiness,"" a notice from CJTF-OIR said. A separate but similar notice coalition forces will conduct ""base defense and ground operational exercises in or near the Khalidiyah region in Iraq to validate weapons systems and maintain crew proficiency and readiness.""
The exercises come as U.S. troops positioned in the Middle East have been attacked 14 times — 11 times in Iraq and three times in Syria — between Oct. 17-24. The attacks include a mix of one-way drones and rockets.

CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour claimed that the ""rest of the world"" agrees with the Queen of Jordan, Rania Al Abdullah’s lament that the western world seems to show more support for Israel over the Palestinian people in the Israel-Hamas war.

Amanpour pushed that most other people around the world acknowledge there is a ""glaring double standard"" in people recognizing the tragedy of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7 while not showing enough sympathy for Palestinians.
The anchor made her comments on ""CNN This Morning"" Wednesday, following her interview with the Queen of Jordan from the previous evening. CNN anchors introduced Amanpour by playing a clip of her interview with the world leader.
In it, the queen stated, ""When October 7th happened, the world immediately and unequivocally stood by Israel and tried to defend itself and condemned the attack that happened. But when we — what we’re seeing the last couple of weeks, we are seeing silence in the world. You know, countries have stopped just expressing concern or acknowledging the casualties. But always with a preface of declaration of support for Israel.""

""And you know, are we being told that it is wrong to kill a family, an entire family at gunpoint, but it’s okay to shell them to death?"" the queen asked.
When asked what she believed the primary takeaway was Wednesday morning, Amanpour said, ""The primary takeaway is that she is expressing exactly what the rest of the world thinks. The world in which the Muslims and many, many other parts of the world believe that there is a, as she said, a glaring double standard.""

Dozens of teddy bears with blindfolds were set up in a display near a fountain in Tel Aviv to call attention to the suffering of Israeli children held captive by Hamas terrorists.
Each of the brown and white stuffed animals featured a picture of one of the roughly 30 children, some as young as nine months old, who were among the 222 people held hostage in Gaza by Hamas fighters following the militant group's attack on Israel on Oct. 7, the Associated Press reported.
Photos of the display show some of the bears were marked with fake blood and some were tied together. Passerbys said they were left speechless.

“It’s just unbelievable. There’s like no words. Because, even with the blood on it you can see, and the blindfolds … it’s very symbolic for me of the captivity of innocent children,” Hilary Meyerov said. “It’s completely heartbreaking.”
An off-duty Israeli soldier stopped to take photos of the display.
“Bring them back. Bring them back,” said Avigail Ben-Yosef. “I’m sending love to all the families, they are waiting for these children, and to all the other hostages.”

Israel is ""weaponizing"" the Holocaust to justify its ""genocide"" and ""war crimes"" against Palestinians, one Israel scholar and professor argued in the Guardian this week.

Raz Segal, an Israel expert and Associate Professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Stockton University in New Jersey, criticized President Biden and Israel's leaders for ""weaponizing the Holocaust"" by comparing the atrocities against Jews to the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians.
Segal acknowledged that the attack, which left at least 1,400 Israelis dead, was the single deadliest massacre of Jews since World War II. However, he argued the context was ""completely different.""
""A powerful state, with powerful allies and a powerful army, engaged in a retaliatory attack against stateless Palestinians under Israeli-settler colonial rule, military occupation and siege, is thus portrayed as powerless Jews in a struggle against Nazis,"" the professor complained. 

While both sides should be held accountable for their ""war crimes,"" world leaders were ""distort[ing]"" reality by not putting the conflict in the context of Israel's ""settler colonial violence against Palestinians since the 1948 Nakba,"" he argued.
 The ""Nakba,"" meaning ""catastrophe,"" is a term that Palestinians use to describe the 1948 establishment of the state of Israel.
""No justice is possible, not in the short term and certainly not in the long term, without a truthful reckoning of how we got here,"" Segal wrote.
He also suggested Israel was demonizing Palestinians in the same way that Nazis did to Jews, to justify their ""genocide.""
""The fantasy of 'fighting Nazis' drives such explicit language, because the image of Nazis is one of ‘pure, unadulterated evil’, which removes all laws and restrictions in the fight against it. Perpetrators of genocide always see their victims as evil and themselves as righteous. This is, indeed, how Nazis saw Jews,"" he wrote.

Israeli 
Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan was unmoved by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres' attempt to defend himself from critics.
In a statement Tuesday, Guterres defended his remarks on the Israel-Hamas war, denying that he justified Hamas' terrorism by stating that the Oct. 7 atrocities ""did not happen in a vacuum.""
""It is a disgrace to the UN that the Secretary-General does not retract his words and is not even able to apologize for what he said yesterday,"" Erdan responded. ""He must resign.""
""The Secretary-General, once again, distorts and twists reality. He clearly said yesterday that the massacre by Hamas ‘did not happen in a vacuum.’ Every person understands very well that the meaning of his words is that Israel has guilt for the actions of Hamas or, at the very least, it shows his understanding for the ‘background’ leading up to the massacre,"" he continued.

""A Secretary-General who does not understand that the murder of innocents can never be understood by any ‘background’ cannot be Secretary-General. It is sad that this is the man who heads the UN which is supposed to fight terrorism and global atrocities. I again call on him to resign.
""Israel will work to convey a clear message to the UN and to its leader that we will not accept the continued bias and hatred towards Israel by this organization.""



Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called for a ""humanitarian pause"" in the Israel-Hamas war, arguing that Israel deserved ""justice"" after the Hamas terrorist attacks but not ""revenge"" in a recent media appearance.
""I think the humanitarian pause is the way to go,"" Pelosi said in an interview on MSNBC Tuesday. ""Look, what Hamas did was barbaric in Israel. It was barbaric, it was outside the circle of civilized human behavior, and if it happened to your family, you would want justice."" 
""I’m not talking about revenge,"" Pelosi added. ""I’m saying justice."" 

Pelosi rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war. ""So there has to be some other place we go instead of just saying ‘let’s have a ceasefire,’"" she said. ""We had a ceasefire in May that was broken by Hamas on Oct. 7th, so let’s remember that, but there may be a few votes in our caucus who may not support the package, but I think by and large, it will be overwhelmingly supported.""
The Israeli government has rejected calls for a ceasefire that have come from some prominent American politicians, including from liberal members of Congress. 
""Until we complete our mission of dismantling Hamas, urging a ceasefire is the pro-Hamas position,"" Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, told Fox News Digital. ""Demanding a ceasefire from Israel is saying that Hamas should get away with what it did — and should keep its ability to do it again,"" Levy said.

Israeli fighter jets and navy soldiers thwarted Hamas terrorists that were attempting to infiltrate Israel by sea on Tuesday, according to footage released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) early Wednesday.

The video shows at least two individuals swimming from the Gaza Strip toward Israeli territory near Zikim, the IDF said.
""The terrorists exited through a tunnel shaft located on the coast of the Gaza Strip and were struck by IDF fighter jets and Naval soldiers,"" the IDF said. ""In addition, IDF fighter jets and Naval soldiers struck a weapons storage facility that was used by the terrorists.""
The video also shows Israeli forces striking the suspected tunnel shaft on the Gaza coast and the weapons storage facility, according to the IDF.
Fox News' Trey Yingst reported from Israel Wednesday at noon local time that small arms fire took place overnight near the beach of Zikim, which sits between Israel and Gaza, to which the Israeli military responded by firing flares.

Two Hamas terrorists were killed during the infiltration attempt, Yingst reported, adding that the group has a ""frogman unit"" made up of trained scuba divers who attempt to access Israeli territory from the Mediterranean Sea.
""It was absolutely a suicide mission. The Israelis have locked down the beach, the sea. They have naval ships off the coast of Gaza and Israel. They've got infantry troops along the northern part of the Gaza Strip,"" Yingst explained, adding that the attempt didn't ""make sense.""

Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad, who survived the Islamic Republic’s kidnapping and assassination plot against her, is speaking out about the brutal plan and asserts the country is ‘absolutely’ behind Hamas’ attack on Israel.

The Department of Justice says Alinejad was targeted at her New York home in an Iran-backed plot to murder the activist for speaking out against the regime’s human rights abuses, according to a previous report. Rafat Amirov, 43, of Iran, Polad Omarov, 38, of the Czech Republic and Slovenia and Khalid Mehdiyev, 24, of Yonkers, New York, were charged last January with money laundering and murder-for-hire in the incident.  

""Being hated by the (barbaric) regime of Iran is a badge of honor for me, but being targeted by the Iranian government for my reporting was intense,"" Alinejad told FOX News Digital. ""When you, as a journalist, challenge the foundations of a totalitarian regime like the Islamic Republic, they often resort to drastic measures to silence you, be it physically or mentally. They may plan to harm, kidnap, or even assassinate you and your family. Simultaneously, they launch a smear campaign against you on social media, aiming to dehumanize and discredit you. I've personally faced both. I survived a kidnapping and an assassination plot."" 
Alinejad, who was warned about 31 threats against her on U.S. soil, has been moving to different safe houses for almost three years and constantly faces death threats for her social media posts against the regime. 

""The word ‘safe’ is too luxury for me and those of us who dare to criticize the Islamic Republic,"" she explained. ""My life is upside down. I have no fear for my own life, but it is scary to see that the Islamic Republic dares to challenge the U.S. government on U.S. soil by trying to kill U.S citizens. Iranian officials (bar) 80 million people from using social media, but at the same time their cyber army inundates every post I make with negative comments, sends death threats, and spreads disinformation to cloud public perception. How ironic that the U.S. tech companies (are) allowing dictators of Iran to enjoy freedom of speech on social media to call for destroying Israel and to spread the death threats against U.S. citizens.""

Some evangelical voters in Iowa are now saying support for Israel has become their top priority for the Republican presidential caucus, now less than three months away, according to a report.

For decades, Christian conservatives have supported candidates who protect the lives of unborn children and curb abortion, but Hamas attacking Israel has changed the 2024 landscape. Israel’s ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza has put new pressure on Republican candidates to directly address the conflict and emphasize traditional Republican support for Israel, according to The Associated Press, which interviewed more than a dozen Iowa conservative activists.
Since the Oct. 7 attack, Iowa’s evangelical pastors, faith leaders and rank-and-file caucus participants have been looking more closely at candidates’ statements, while ministers urge their congregations to keep those positions top-of-mind when weighing their options.
Several 
leading Republican candidates, including former President Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott, have told Iowans where they stand on the conflict and shared how they would respond if they were in the White House.
In Iowa, just three days after Hamas attacked Israel and killed more than 1,400 people — which were mostly civilians — several Christian pastors delivered a message meant to resonate both biblically and politically.
""What we’re seeing in that region is pure evil,"" said Steve Rowland, a senior minister at the Rising Sun Church of Christ in the Des Moines suburb of Altoona. ""Israel has mobilized their army, and they are intent on stamping out evil, and we should be behind them. That's where we should be, and I want you to know that, as a pastor.""

Some Christians support Israel due to Old Testament writings that Jews are God’s chosen people and that Israel is their rightful homeland. Some evangelicals believe Israel is key to an end-times prophecy that will bring about the return of the Christian messiah.
Evangelical Christians dominate the first-in-the-nation Republican presidential caucuses, and several GOP contenders have begun to discuss the conflict in black-and-white terms, even accusing President Biden of not being tough enough on Hamas or Iran, a financial supporter of the terrorist group.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres responded to his critics on Wednesday, denying that he justified Hamas' terror attack on Israel in remarks to the U.N. Security Council. 

""I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statements yesterday in the Security Council. As if, as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas. This is false. It was the opposite,"" Guterres said in a statement. 
""In the beginning of my intervention yesterday, I clearly stated, and I quote, 'I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel. Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnaping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets,'"" he said. 
""Indeed, I spoke of the grievances of the Palestinian people. And in doing so, I also clearly stated, and I quote, 'But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas,'"" Guterres continued. 

""And then I went on with my intervention, referring all my positions on all aspects of the Middle East crisis. I believe it was necessary to set the record straight, especially out of respect to the victims and to their families."" 
He did not take questions from reporters.

""The words from Hamas commanders,"" according to the Israeli air force, ""consist of an order to kill Jews and encouragement to decapitate their victims and tear out their hearts and livers. 
""Know that this enemy of yours is a disease that has no cure, other than beheading and extracting the hearts and livers!"" the Israeli military agency quoted the note as saying in a post on X. 
The emergence of the purported note comes days after Israel released what it described as ""gruesome"" and ""unseen"" bodycam footage of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack in order to counter a ""Holocaust denial-like phenomenon evolving in real time.""  

The screening happened in Israel Monday morning. Some of the content, according to Fox News correspondent Mike Tobin, included Israelis being ambushed in their cars, a girl being executed after Hamas terrorists found her hiding under a desk and a father dying after a Hamas fighter threw a grenade into a bomb shelter that he and his two children were seeking cover in. 
Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy said in a video posted on X before the release that the Israel Defense Forces have ""been collecting footage from bodycams taken by the Hamas death squads,"" and that they would be making the footage public to maintain a record to counter those who doubt whether certain events took place.

Fox News' Trey Yingst took viewers inside a hospital in Khan Younis, the second-largest city in the Gaza Strip, where doctors treat patients injured by Israel's relentless airstrikes. 
Yingst met a 14-month-old Gazan girl in a hospital bed who was cared for by her aunt after an Israeli airstrike killed her mother. She and her twin brother, Ahmed, survived the blast. 
""My sister was protecting the boy, Ahmed, so he wasn't injured. But the daughter, as you can see, is injured,"" the woman explained. ""I'm sure he feels the absence of his sister. As we say, twins are always connected."" 

Since Hamas launched a brutal surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, more than 2,000 Palestinian children have been killed in Israeli airstrikes and shelling, according to the humanitarian group Save the Children. 
Hospitals in Gaza are running low on supplies and doctors worry they will not be able to save lives if the bombardment continues without humanitarian relief.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the United States is complicit in alleged war crimes committed by Israel in Gaza.

""The U.S. is definitely an accomplice of the criminals,"" Khamenei said during a speech in Tehran. ""In other words, in this crime the U.S.'s hand is drenched and stained up to its elbow with the blood of the oppressed, the children, the sick, women and others.""
He went on to accuse the U.S. of ""managing the crime that is being committed in Gaza."" 
Khamenei insisted that the Palestinians will ultimately prevail in the war against Israel, which started when Hamas infiltrated the Jewish state on Oct. 7 and brutally tortured, raped, killed and dismembered as many as 1,400 Israeli civilians. 

The United States has supported Israel's right to self-defense and the bombing campaign to eradicate Hamas while calling for humanitarian aid to be delivered to the Palestinian people caught in the crossfire in Gaza. The U.S. has moved two aircraft carriers into the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iran-backed terrorist groups like Hezbollah from joining the war on the side of Hamas.  


The father of an American kidnapped by Hamas will not stop searching until he brings his son home. 
Hersh Goldberg-Polin was last seen being loaded into a pickup truck by Hamas militants when they attacked an Israeli music festival Oct. 7, kidnapping and killing hundreds of attendees.  
""I have one mission: Get Hersch home,"" Jon Polin told ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" on Tuesday. ""There's no partial success here. There's no 90% success here. It's either success or failure, and I want to bring Hersh home."" 
Polin said Hersh, who lived in California until moving to Israel at 8 years-old, is ""a child of both countries"" and called on people to stop politicizing the attack. 

""Let's turn this into what [it] is, a global humanitarian catastrophe, and the whole world and foreign ministers everywhere should be screaming to get these people out and don't politicize them."" 
Polin said video of the kidnapping shows his son ""with a stump of a left arm bleeding out"" and the family hopes he has received medical care and is alive.  
""The Israeli government lists him officially as a hostage, as taken by Hamas, as we've seen in the video, and still lists him as a hostage, but we don't know. We have no proof of life,"" he told MacCallum. ""We don't know if once he was loaded into that pickup truck at 9:00 in the morning on October 7, if he was tossed off the truck after 30 seconds or if he made it into Gaza where his phone was last pinged. We don't know his status, but officially he's still listed as ‘kidnapped’."" 


A family member of a hero who saved the lives of two women by charging at Hamas terrorists spoke out in an interview with Fox News Digital about his final moments. 

Addir Mesika, 23, was born and raised in New York. He was with three childhood friends, his girlfriend, and another young woman at the music festival which became a massacre after Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel and butchered, tortured, raped and mutilated Israeli civilians. 
""He was a real hero,"" Morielle Lotan, Mesika's aunt, said. ""I think he knew what his end was going to be, and he did it anyway.""
Mesika and his friends were resting in the tents at the end of the party when they heard rocket sirens. Hamas sent out missiles from the Gaza Strip as a cover for their ground invasion. The group of friends quickly packed, got into the car and drove to a small bomb shelter for safety. While in the car, Lotan said Mesika was texting his younger brother about what was happening. At the time, they didn’t know that Hamas terrorists infiltrated parts of the country. 

When Mesika and his friends heard machine guns and Arabic language – it dawned on them that there were terrorists looking to hunt and kill. They saw the terrorists approaching other shelters and throwing grenades into them. When they heard terrorists approaching their shelter, Mesika and his best friend Eli instructed the girls to hide, left the shelter and charged at the terrorists to attract attention.
The boys were killed by gunfire in a heroic act to save the women, who remained in the shelter for six hours until the Israel Defense Forces rescued them. 
Mesika, Eli and another friend named Matan – who were childhood buddies – were buried side-by-side together in Israel. 
""There's some… vortex that we're in at the moment,"" Lotan said. ""We're broken and devastated, and angry, and sad and worried.""

Families with loved ones killed or captured by Hamas shared their stories on ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday morning.
Netta Atzili, 20, survived the Oct. 7 terror attack by holding the handle of a door shut to prevent the terrorists from finding him. 

""I have no idea why they didn't kill me,"" Atzili said. ""If they were smarter, or stronger, or more insightful or more determined, I would be dead.""
He said that in many cases the terrorists shot through doors or used explosives to blast them down, ""but for some reason they didn't do that with me. I guess they were just there to loot."" 
Atzili said he grabbed a knife from the kitchen to give himself a fighting chance if he were discovered by the killers. ""I would probably still be dead, but I would have a chance,"" he said recalled thinking. 
His parents are both missing after the attack.
Another survivor, Adele Raemer, said she hid in a safe room for nine hours, ""deadly petrified,"" with terrorists just inches away on the other side of a wall.

""We heard their voices in Arabic, shouting to each other,"" Raemer said. ""We heard machine gun fire shooting at each other. This is something you usually don't hear. We've never been infiltrated before, ever. This is something that is totally — we don't know how to handle ourselves.""

The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah met with leaders of the Palestinian terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad to discuss an alliance that will ""achieve real victory for the resistance,"" Hezbollah said on Wednesday.
Part of an Iran-backed regional alliance, the heavily armed Hezbollah has had daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces along the Israeli-Lebanese frontier since war broke out between Israel and Hamas on Oct. 7.

The meeting involved Hezbollah's Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri and Islamic Jihad chief Ziad al-Nakhala, Hezbollah said in a statement. It did not say when the meeting took place.
""An assessment was made of the international positions being taken and what the parties of the Axis of Resistance must do ... to realise a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestinian and to halt the brutal aggression,"" Hezbollah said, according to Reuters. 
""There was agreement on continuing the coordination.""
The terror group also said two of its fighters were killed on Wednesday. Israel has killed 40 Hezbollah terrorists along the border with Lebanon since the start of the war.

Israel continued to pound Hamas and Islamic Jihad cells in Gaza with airstrikes overnight, resulting in more civilian casualties as the terrorist groups hide behind human shields. 

Save the Children, a leading humanitarian organization, says more than 2,000 children have been killed since war broke out between Israel and Hamas on Oct. 7. Thousands of homes, playgrounds, schools, hospitals and places of worship have been damaged or destroyed in Gaza, the group says, as the Israel Defense Forces aim at military targets placed near civilian infrastructure.
Fox News' Trey Yingst reported that Israeli forces killed two Hamas terrorists attempting to infiltrate Israel through the Mediterranean Sea overnight. Additionally, the Israelis are responding with strikes in southern Lebanon targeting the terrorist group Hezbollah as fears grow that the Iran-backed group might join the war on the side of Hamas.

Israeli soldiers stand ready to invade Gaza once they receive orders to do so. Reports have said an expected ground operation in Gaza has been delayed as Israel and Qatari mediators work behind the scenes to secure the release of some 222 hostages held by Hamas.

Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt
 said he held private conversations with CNN and MSNBC about their coverage of Israel after scolding the networks on the air and urging news organizations around the world to do a better job covering the tragic Hamas terror attacks of Oct. 7. 
""I've called out the coverage on CNN while I was being interviewed on CNN. I've called out the coverage on MSNBC while I was being interviewed on MSNBC,"" Greenblatt told Fox News Digital. 
""All of them need to do better. They need to do better because this isn't just about antisemitism, although it is. The carelessness with which they treat Jewish victims is crazy,"" he continued. ""This isn't just about Israel, although it is. Demonizing and dehumanizing Israelis and Zionists is how you get this kind of barbarism and these atrocities. This is about humanity.""
Greenblatt believes the big picture is ""about how we see each other as human beings deserving of a degree of dignity"" and respect. 

""The failure to do so, is why we have this problem in the first place,"" Greenblatt said.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan referred to Hamas terrorists as a ""liberation group"" trying to protect the Palestinian people. 

In an address to his ruling party’s legislators on Wednesday, Erdogan also said he has canceled plans to visit Israel as part of his country’s policy of normalizing its relations with the Jewish state, adding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had “misused our goodwill.”
Erdogan sharpened his criticisms of Israel, describing the siege of Gaza as one of the ""bloodiest, most disgusting and most savage attacks in history."" 
“We have no problem with the Israeli state, but we never have, and never will, accept the atrocities committed by Israel and the fact that it acts as an organization rather than a state,” he said.
The Turkish leader called for an immediate cease-fire, for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza and for talks for the release of hostages to begin. He also suggested the establishment of an international peace conference for Israel and the Palestinians.

“All sides must pull their fingers off the trigger, a cease-fire must be declared,” he said.
The Associated Press contributed to this update.


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokeswoman denounced UN Secretary-General António Guterres for saying Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack that killed an estimated 1,400 people ""did not happen in a vacuum.""
Guterres addressed the UN Security Council describing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the need for a two-state solution. 
""It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation,"" he said. ""They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.""

""But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.""
Netanyahu spokeswoman Tal Heinrich said Guterres’ remarks showed there is anti-Israel bias at the United Nations.  
""This is nothing new, this crazy double-standard. What the UN secretary-general said, that this Hamas attack, the massacre of Oct. 7, didn't come in a 'vacuum.' That is mind-boggling,"" she said Tuesday on ""America Reports.""

""Can you imagine the UN secretary-general saying such a terrible sentence after the 9/11 attack? That the 9/11 attack didn't come in a vacuum? That the Pearl Harbor attack didn't come in a vacuum? That the Boko Haram kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in Nigeria in 2014 didn't come in a vacuum?"" Heinrich asked. ""This is insane. This is insanity. The civilized world must stand with Israel in its war against terrorism. The message that a UN secretary-general must send out is that terrorism is a dead end.""
Guterres told the Security Council he was ""deeply concerned"" about the ""clear violations of international humanitarian law"" in Gaza after Israel cut off water, electricity, food and fuel. 
Fox News Digital's Ashley Carnahan contributed to this update.


Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Israel, slammed United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres' speech at the U.N. Security Council meeting in a statement. 

Guterres stated Tuesday that the Oct. 7 terror attacks on Israel by Hamas ""did not happen in a vacuum"" and that the ""Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation.""
Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan responded to those remarks, saying, ""The slaughter of Jews by Hamas on October 7th was genocidal in its intents and immeasurably brutal in its form. Part of why it differs from the Holocaust is because Jews have today a state and an army. We are not defenseless and at the mercy of others.
""However, it puts to test the sincerity of world leaders, intellectuals and influencers that come to Yad Vashem and pledge “Never Again”.  Those who seek to ""understand"", look for a justifying context, do not categorically condemn the perpetrators, and do not call for the unconditional and immediate release of the abducted – fail the test. UN Secretary General António Guterres failed the test.""

Guterres' speech drew fiery condemnations from Israeli officials. Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, demanded that Guterres resign, accusing him of showing ""understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children, women, and the elderly.""
""There is no justification or point in talking to those who show compassion for the most terrible atrocities committed against the citizens of Israel and the Jewish people. There are simply no words,"" Erdan said.

Saudi Arabia intercepted at least one of the cruise missiles launched at Israel by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to reports.
Last week, the USS Carney, a guided missile destroyer operating in the Northern Red Sea, intercepted several missiles fired towards Israel near the coast of Yemen. The Pentagon confirmed the Navy destroyer shot down four land attack cruise missiles and several drones that were launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen.

The Wall Street Journal reports the Houthi militants fired five cruise missiles, and that at least one of them was intercepted by Saudi Arabia as it protected its airspace. Saudi Arabia's involvement in the incident was previously unknown. The Arab country's Patriot Missile Defense system is provided by the United States.
There were no reported casualties to U.S. forces in the missile and drone attack. 
A senior U.S. Defense official said Monday the military expects a ""significant escalation"" of attacks against U.S. troops in the Middle East and pointed to Iran meddling in the region. 
""I think it’s fair to say when you see this uptick in activity in attacks by many of these groups, there’s Iranian fingerprints all over it,"" the defense official said.

Taysir Mubasher, the commander of the North Khan Yunis battalion of Hamas, was killed by Israeli soldiers Wednesday morning, according to intelligence gathered by Israel Defense Forces and Israel Securities Authority.
Mubasher, who previously served as a commander in Hamas' naval forces and held positions in weapons manufacturing, had extensive experience in the military, according to the IDF. He was also related to senior Hamas operatives, including Mohammed Deif, supreme commander of Hamas' military wing.

The IDF said Mubasher was responsible for ""numerous terror attacks"" against Israelis and IDF soldiers over the years, including the 2002 attack at the Atzmona pre-military academy, which left five students dead and several more injured.
He is also accused of directing the 2003 terror attack in the Vered Post, being involved in the infiltration into Zikim beaches during Operation ""Protective Edge,"" and manufacturing explosive devices used to explode a tunnel under an IDF post in Gush Katif in 2004, which claimed the life of an IDF soldier and injured several others.
Since Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Israeli forces say they have killed at least 21 of the terrorist group's leaders.


The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported early Wednesday morning that Hamas terrorists attempted to invade Israel by sea on Tuesday.

""Hamas terrorists attempting to infiltrate Israeli territory by sea were identified by naval forces in southern Israel earlier today,"" the IDF explained in a post on X, formerly Twitter. ""The terrorists were thwarted and the tunnel was struck, in addition to a weapons warehouse used by the terrorists in Gaza.""
The IDF later updated the post, explaining that ""Hamas terrorists were found exiting a tunnel on the Gaza coast, attempting to infiltrate southern Israel via sea.""
Fox News' Trey Yingst reported from Israel Wednesday at noon local time that small arms fire took place overnight near the beach of Zikim, which sits between Israel and Gaza, to which the Israeli military responded by firing flares.
Two Hamas militants were killed during the infiltration attempt, Yingst reported, adding that the terrorist group has a ""frogman unit"" made up of trained scuba divers who attempt to access Israeli territory from the Mediterranean Sea.

""This just gives you a sense of the different ways Hamas is trying to target Israel,"" Yingst said.
Hamas has attempted to infiltrate Israel by sea before, Yingst said, and past videos have shown Israel's navy responding to the attack by firing into the water and killing any militants in it.
""It was absolutely a suicide mission. The Israelis have locked down the beach, the sea. They have naval ships off the coast of Gaza and Israel. They've got infantry troops along the northern part of the Gaza Strip,"" Yingst explained, adding that the attempt didn't ""make sense.""
Fox News Digital's Andrea Vacchiano contributed to this report.


The Israeli Air Force said Wednesday morning it conducted two separate airstrikes overnight, one in West Bank and another in Syria.
An airstrike took place in Syria in response to two rockets that were fired into Israel, Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson reported from the Jewish State. Military infrastructure and Syrian army positions for launching mortar bombs were targeted in the aerial attack, the IAF said.
The Jenin refugee camp inside the West Bank was also hit by an airstrike after ""armed terrorists shot and threw explosives at our forces"" during an activity, the IAF said.
""A manned aircraft remotely attacked the terrorists to remove the danger,"" the branch wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in Hebrew. ""Vulnerabilities have been detected.""
Both operations were also made public on the IAF's X account.

UC Berkeley takes fire after extra credit offered in class for attending pro-Palestinian student ‘walkout’,2023-10-25,Fox News,['Hanna Panreck']," FOX News correspondent Alexis McAdams has the latest on outrage over the Israel-Hamas war on 'America's Newsroom.'
A University of California-Berkeley graduate student offered extra credit to students if they attended a student ""walkout"" in support of Gaza, according to a screenshot posted to social media, leading the university to respond after a firestorm of criticism erupted.
""We're offering a field trip and/or extra credit opportunity: (1) Students can attend the national student walkout tomorrow against the settler-colonial occupation of Gaza (info attached below) OR (2) Students can watch a short documentary on Palestine and call/email your local California representative using this linktree,"" the email from graduate assistant Victoria Huynh said, according to a screenshot posted to social media. 
The email said either option would count as a ""field trip or an extra 5 points."" Huynh leads a class called ""Asian American Communities and Race Relations."" The screen shotted message concluded the class would discuss ""Palestinian history in relation to class concepts like colonialism, imperialism, and Third World solidarity.""
There are multiple Instagram posts on UC Berkeley's ""Bears for Palestine"" account promoting a walkout ""against genocide, settler-colonialism & the siege on Gaza"" on Wednesday. ""End the siege on Gaza now,"" one post reads.

ANTI-ISRAEL STATEMENTS SWEEP MORE COLLEGES; CRITICS SLAM LEADERS FOR STAYING OUT OF FRAY
UC Berkeley's Assistant Vice Chancellor at the Office of Communications and Public Affairs Dan Mogulof told Fox News Digital that the university moved quickly to ensure the options would be ""changed.""
""The situation has been remedied, the assignment has been changed and there are now a number of options for extra credit, not just one,"" he said. 
When asked about the updated assignment, Mogulof said the students can now attend any local event they want that was relevant to the course's subject. 
""Students can attend any local event they wish—such as a book talk or a panel discussion----related to the course’s subject…or they can watch any documentary they wish about the Middle East,"" he said.

""The university responds quickly to violations of policy and is committed to imposing appropriate consequences when policy is violated,"" he told Fox News Digital. 
The student who appeared to send the email did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
Critics took to social media to call out the move and some pointed out that they did not initially appear to offer an option for an event that supported Israel.

""It's one thing to ask a student to engage in the academic exercise of arguing a position they might not agree with in class (i.e. devil's advocacy).

Senior GOP congressman felt ‘sick’ after viewing footage of Hamas attacks in closed-door briefing,2023-11-14,Fox News,['Houston Keene'],"FOX News' Griff Jenkins reports the latest on the pro-Israel rally from Washington, D.C.
A senior Republican congressman told Fox News Digital he felt sickened after viewing footage of Palestinian terror organization Hamas' Oct. 7 surprise terror attacks that killed 1,200 Israeli citizens.
California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa spoke with Fox News Digital over the phone after viewing the footage with most of his congressional colleagues.
Issa said the ""vast majority"" of congressional lawmakers were in the Cannon Caucus Room to view the footage. The congressman noted that there were ""over 300"" people in attendance, which led to the screening being ""standing room only.""

The senior House Foreign Affairs Committee Republican said the footage of ""uniformed, military Hamas and civilian-dressed Hamas"" killing ""unarmed civilians"" made him sick.
""I've seen decapitation and I've seen just beating, and beating on both dead and alive bodies,"" Issa said. ""And quite frankly, I'm just sick to my stomach.""
Issa said he believes the ""most important detail"" was the multiple sources of the footage. Some videos came from terrorists' own social media posts, but most were from body camera footage and cellphone footage recorded by Hamas.
""I mean, the details. And you can hear it, but when you see it, it's like visiting Auschwitz or Birkenau, except it's still going on visually,"" Issa said.

Since the Oct. 7 attacks – during which Issa was in the Middle East – antisemitic hate crimes have dramatically increased, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Protests against Israel have also intensified, and there are numerous viral videos of protesters ripping down posters of Israelis who have been kidnapped by Hamas.
""I respect people's rights to protest for the things that they think are unfair,"" Issa said. ""This isn't one of them.""
""Gaza was not occupied. This was not a resistance within Gaza, but rather a deliberate attack on civilians over the border,"" he continued.
Issa said the situation is one of ""two separate things"" and that we ""can talk about the unfairness of the Palestinians not having a country of their own."" But those discussions should be separate from condemnation of what was shown to members of Congress, Issa said.
Issa said he believes the ""most important detail"" is that there are ""so many sources"" of the footage, noting some videos come from terrorists' own social media posts but are primarily from body camera and cellphone footage recorded by Hamas. (Yousef Masoud/Majority World/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)
The videos depicted ""the unprovoked slaughter of civilians, a degree of inhumanity that you usually think for the machete world of elsewhere, but not in an area where education and opportunity is available the way it is for the Palestinians in Gaza,"" Issa said.
The California Republican said he believes the House ""did the right thing"" by passing the Israel aid bill ""overwhelmingly"" earlier this month, a bill that paid for aid by slashing the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) funding.
Issa blasted President Biden as well, saying the president is ""not complaining about the offset as much as he's complaining about it not being in two other areas.""
""I don't think anything could be less appropriate. You know, funding for Ukraine and the ongoing war there, which is a military-on-military war primarily, is something I support. But supporting two fronts against two aggressors doesn't have to be combined. And, you know, I think the Senate is being petty, I think the president's being extremely petty.""
Issa said the Constitution is ""very clear"" on the House's job to appropriate and that they have done that job while trying ""to do it in a responsible way by finding funds that are less important.""

Progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., laid into Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s proposed $110 billion aid package in a letter to Senate colleagues on Tuesday night over funds allocated toward Israel in its ongoing war against Hamas.
""At a time when some 16,000 Palestinians have been killed in the last two months, two thirds of whom are women and children, and more than 40,000 have been injured… No, I do not think we should be appropriating $10.1 billion for the right-wing, extremist Netanyahu government to continue its current military strategy,"" Sanders wrote. 
Senate Democrats unveiled the details of their $110 billion aid proposal earlier on Tuesday. It includes money for Ukraine, Israel, humanitarian aid for Gaza and elsewhere, and some funding for the U.S. border.
Schumer, D-N.Y., is expected to hold a vote for the mammoth package sometime this week.

""There are pieces of this bill I strongly support, but in its present form I do not think it serves the best interests of the American people,"" the senator wrote.

Sanders, among the most prominent Jewish members of Congress, has also been one of the most critical of Israel’s actions in the wake of Hamas’s brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israeli civilians. 
He’s previously called to condition U.S. aid to Israel on its actions in Gaza, something mainstream Democrats criticized. 
In his letter on Tuesday night, Sanders said Israel ""has every right to defend itself"" but ""It does not, however, have the right to wage all-out war against innocent men, women, and children who had nothing to do with the Hamas attack.""

Hundreds of pro-Palestine protesters march to Biden’s Delaware home as president returns from DC,2023-11-11,Fox News,['Timothy H.J. Nerozzi'],"The march follows a massive demonstration at New York City's Grand Central Terminal.

President Biden is returning to his Delaware home on Saturday — only a short distance from hundreds of protesters accusing him of genocide.
Biden is returning to his residence in Wilmington after delivering a Veterans' Day address as the ""Delaware Palestine March"" commences in the same area.
""Biden, Biden, you can't hide! We charge you with genocide!"" the crowd chanted as protesters began gathering earlier this afternoon.

2024 showdown: East Palestine leaders take sides in Ohio’s Republican primary race,2023-11-15,Fox News,['Paul Steinhauser'],"Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on cleanup efforts seven months after the catastrophe on 'Special Report.'
FIRST ON FOX – Political leaders in a small Ohio town that was thrust into the national spotlight earlier this year after a train derailment triggered the release of hazardous materials are making an endorsement in the state's competitive GOP Senate primary in a race that could determine if Republicans win back the chamber's majority.
East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway and fire chief Keith Drabick, as well as Columbiana County Commissioner Tim Weigle, are endorsing state Sen. Matt Dolan. The announcement was shared first with Fox News on Wednesday.
Dolan, a former top county prosecutor and Ohio assistant attorney general whose family owns Major League Baseball's Cleveland Guardians, is one of the three major Republicans vying for their party's 2024 nomination in the race to challenge longtime Democratic Sen. Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown in a one-time general election battleground state that's turned red in recent cycles.
The small town, located along the border with Pennsylvania about 20 miles south of Youngstown, Ohio, was the site of a February train derailment that spilled hazardous chemicals into the air, soil and water and triggered significant evacuations.

The accident spurred Congressional hearings and a bipartisan railroad safety bill. And nine months after the derailment, lives are still shattered in East Palestine as Norfolk Southern continues its cleanup.
East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway, in backing Dolan, said in a statement that ""in the aftermath of unspeakable tragedy, Ohioans came together from many walks of life to lift one another up and begin a recovery process that continues today. Through it all, one leader among many has stood out for his efforts grounded in responsiveness and results.""
BLUE TO RED: FOUR SENATE SEATS THAT MAY FLIP IN THE 2024 ELECTIONS
""Matt Dolan didn’t come here for headlines, cameras, or social media clicks. He quietly showed up, rolled up his sleeves and asked how he could help. Each day, Matt has stood with East Palestine and as we continue to rebuild, he’s focused on our community’s needs and worked with us to develop a recovery plan that gets results. That’s why I’m proud to stand with Matt Dolan,"" Conaway emphasized.

Keith Drabick, the town's fire chief, highlighted that Dolan ""cares about results, not who gets the credit. He’s taken the time to come here, visit with our people, understand our challenges, and get to work in a manner that serves others. We need more leaders like Matt Dolan.""
And Columbiana County Commissioner Tim Weigle said that Dolan ""has taken a personal interest in the rebuilding and success of our community, and that makes him exactly the kind of proven public servant we need in Washington.""
WITH NINE WEEKS TO GO UNTIL THE FIRST VOTES, THIS CANDIDATE REMAINS THE COMMANDING FRONT-RUNNER IN THE GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE
Pointing to the derailment, Dolan said in a statement that ""this year our entire nation has seen that Columbiana County personifies resilience, hard work, and grit. When the derailment occurred, local leaders and first responders stepped up. They didn’t take ‘no’ for an answer. They worked together to hold intergovernmental leaders, agencies, and private companies alike accountable, and they demanded results.""
And Dolan vowed that ""in the U.S. Senate I will never stop working to build upon their progress and deliver results for East Palestine, Columbiana County, and our entire state.""

Dolan's in a three-way battle for the GOP Senate nomination, along with Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Bernie Moreno, a successful Cleveland-based businessman and luxury auto dealership giant. 
Dolan and Moreno are making their second straight runs for the Senate. Moreno suspended his campaign a couple of months before the May 2022 primary. Dolan surged near the end of the primary race, coming in third, just behind former state Treasurer Josh Mandel.

The 2022 nomination was won by former hedge fund executive and best-selling author JD Vance, who landed former President Donald Trump’s endorsement just before the primary. Vance went on to defeat longtime Democrat Rep. Tim Ryan in last year's general election to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman.
Vance earlier this year endorsed Moreno, but Trump to date has remained neutral in the three-way primary battle.

Trump visited East Palestine after the derailment, and praised the mayor's efforts. The town is located in Ohio's Mahoning Valley, which is considered part of the Rust Belt, where working-class voters predominate. Trump made major gains for Republicans in an area, which previously was a Democratic stronghold.
Brown, who’s the only Democrat to win statewide in Ohio over the past decade, will be heavily targeted by Republicans in a state that was once a premiere battleground before shifting red.
Democrats currently control the U.S. Senate with a 51-49 majority, but Republicans are looking at a very favorable Senate map in 2024, with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs. Three of those seats are in red states that Trump carried in 2020: Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.
Five others seats are in key swing states narrowly carried by Biden in 2020: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Professor scolds BBC live on-air for refusing to label Hamas ‘terrorists’,2023-10-16,Fox News,['Brian Flood'],"Why the media uses euphemisms for Hamas. 
Author and professor Matt Goodwin scolded the BBC live, on the air over the network's decision not to label Hamas as ""terrorists"" Monday.
Goodwin was on the BBC's ""Politics Live"" when he became infuriated during a conversation about people who sympathize with Palestinians and the way British Jews have been treated since Hamas launched its deadly terror attacks on Israel. 
""I can’t remember a time in my life when I felt more ashamed by our national debate, and our country, as I have over the last week. I’ve tried to imagine how I would feel if I was a British Jew. We have a national broadcaster, the BBC, unable to call a Nazi-inspired, ISIS-inspired terrorist group ‘terrorists,’"" Goodwin said.

""We have the same broadcaster investigating BBC Arabic journalists for expressing sympathy for Hamas, we have the institutions of our national community, like Wembley Stadium, showing the rainbow flag to protest against Qatar, but not showing the colors of Israel in solidarity,"" he continued. ""And we have the universities, where I work, a few years ago fall over themselves to express solidarity with George Floyd, and what happened centuries ago in America, but are unable to issue the same condemnation of what has happened in Israel."" 
Goodwin went on to say that anti-Israeli protesters and anyone who glorifies terrorism should be ""treated the same way as supporters of ISIS."" 
Last week, BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson published a piece explaining the BBC’s decision not to label Hamas as terrorists. 
THEY'RE ‘CELEBRATING’ A ‘MASSACRE OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS’: JEWISH COLLEGE STUDENTS DENOUNCE ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST
""Terrorism is a loaded word, which people use about an outfit they disapprove of morally. It's simply not the BBC's job to tell people who to support and who to condemn - who are the good guys and who are the bad guys,"" he wrote. 
""We regularly point out that the British and other governments have condemned Hamas as a terrorist organization, but that's their business. We also run interviews with guests and quote contributors who describe Hamas as terrorists,"" Simpson continued. ""The key point is that we don't say it in our voice. Our business is to present our audiences with the facts, and let them make up their own minds.""
Goodwin’s website suggests his mission is ""to help people make sense of, navigate, and respond to a political and cultural revolution which is sweeping through Western societies.""
CBC LEAKED EMAILS TELL REPORTERS TO NOT USE 'TERRORIST' IN HAMAS COVERAGE: 'THIS IS OPINION, NOT FACT'
Freelance journalist Noah Abrahams recently said he wouldn't work with the BBC going forward because of the decision not to call Hamas ""terrorists.""
""I have morals and I stick by them. I think the words ‘justified’ and ‘unjustified’ have been thrown around a lot since the weekend and I think the BBC’s refusal to use the correct terminology is unjustified,"" Abrahams told Peter Cardwell on TalkTV. 
""Words, quite literally, are fundamental to the English language. They impact how we think, how we react, how we act. They have influence, the phrase ‘freedom fighter’ distracts from the reality of terrorism,"" he continued. ""To those easily influenced, it implies what is not. These people aren’t freedom fighters… they are terrorists.""

Groups fear faculty that defended Hamas could set California standards: ‘Institutionalization of antisemitism’,2023-11-16,Fox News,['Hannah Ray Lambert'],"More than 100 groups are urging the University of California to nix a proposed ethnic studies admission requirement after faculty said ""the quiet part out loud.""
Dozens of religious and educational organizations are urging the University of California to reject a proposed ethnic studies admission requirement in light of an influential faculty council's defense of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre.
""The ethnic studies faculty at the University of California have essentially taken off their mask and shown themselves to be completely sympathetic to the anti-Zionist, pro-Hamas cause,"" said Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, director of the AMCHA Initiative, which tracks antisemitism at universities.

BLUE STATE SUSPENDS BASIC SKILLS GRADUATION REQUIREMENT AGAIN, CITING HARM TO STUDENTS OF COLOR
The controversy is twofold, centering on the state's high school ethnic studies mandate and a separate proposal to make completion of an ethnic studies course a requirement for admission to the University of California. The latter faces renewed opposition after one of the key groups advocating for the requirement penned a letter demanding UC administrators stop referring to Hamas’ attack on Israel as ""terrorism.""
""Through ethnic studies, what we're seeing is the institutionalization of antisemitism,"" said Brandy Shufutinsky of the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies, which opposes narrow and ""radical"" ideological agendas in education.
In 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill making California the first state to require all students to complete an ethnic studies course in order to graduate. The bill came after a long debate over the model curriculum, early drafts of which AMCHA Initiative and other Jewish groups argued contained antisemitic material.
That requirement takes effect with the graduating class of 2030, though schools must start offering classes by the 2025-26 school year.
But in 2020, as legislators were arguing over the state mandate, the UC faculty senate Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) began considering a proposal to add ethnic studies as an ""H"" requirement for admission to UC colleges. Currently, all high school applicants must satisfy what are known as the A-G subject requirements, including history, English, math, science and art.
A UC mandate would effectively usurp the state law, which grants each school district the freedom to decide what to include in ethnic studies courses, according to Rossman-Benjamin.

If approved, it would push every public and private high school in the state to require not just an ethnic studies class, but one ""that met the standards of the UC ethnic studies faculty,"" she said.
Otherwise, students would not be eligible to apply to UC schools, nor California State University, which has the same course requirements, EdSource reported.
The UC Ethnic Studies Faculty Council has been instrumental in crafting and advocating for the admissions requirement. Drafts of the course criteria placed a heavy emphasis on ""anti-racist and anti-colonial liberation.""
The council recently renewed the call for BOARS to approve the requirement, noting that ethnic studies scholars have revised the course criteria five times ""in response to input from non-expert stakeholders.""
Fox News reached out to several members of the Ethnic Studies Faculty Council leadership requesting an interview or comment, but did not get a response addressing the proposed admissions requirement.

'SURROGATES' FOR HAMAS: UNIVERSITY REGENT SLAMS 'APPALLING' LETTER FROM ETHNIC STUDIES FACULTY
The council defended the Oct. 7 Hamas attack — which killed around 1,200 people, primarily Israeli civilians — as the actions of a ""community trying to free themselves from decades-long ethnic cleansing and genocide.""
""We call on the UC administrative leadership to retract its charges of terrorism, to uplift the Palestinian freedom struggle, and to stand against Israel’s war crimes against and ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Palestinian people,"" the council wrote last month.
Shufutinsky, an education consultant with the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies, said she was shocked the council ""felt very comfortable saying the quiet part out loud.""
""But that's also beneficial because now we are very aware of exactly where they stand and why we have to stand against the proposals that they're making,"" she told Fox News.
AMCHA and more than 100 other religious, education and civil rights organizations signed a letter urging UC leadership to ""immediately"" reject the ""H"" requirement, arguing that ""faculty who cannot acknowledge that the Hamas massacre is terrorism … must not be trusted to establish state-wide ethnic studies standards for California students.""
Rossman-Benjamin said she thinks the proposal is ""dead in the water"" now.
""It's sort of a no-brainer to say, 'This is just not gonna happen. It can't happen. This is an outrage,'"" she said. ""The people who devised this proposal have shown themselves to be so sort of bigoted and ultimately un-academic, un-scholarly, politically-motivated activists who will harm our kids and harm our communities.""

ISRAELI ACTRESS DEMANDS FBI PROBE FUNDING OF COLLEGE GROUPS 'BRAINWASHING' US STUDENTS
Shufutinsky said the ethnic studies discipline has adopted a strict binary that often casts Jews as white and therefore, oppressors.
""There's this whole idea that we've seen, unfortunately, since Oct. 7, that anything an oppressed group of people does to a so-called oppressor group of people is legitimized, and it's acceptable,"" she said.
But the faculty council views critics as trying to suppress the teaching of ""hard truths"" about ""settler colonialism, apartheid, and resistance.""
Now we are very aware of exactly where they stand and why we have to stand against the proposals that they're making
In September, the council wrote to Newsom and California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, objecting to ""guardrails"" written into the high school mandate. Specifically, the council opposes a ban on promoting ""bias, bigotry, or discrimination against any person or group of persons on the basis of any category protected by Section 220"" of the state educational code.
""This guardrail has been weaponized by pro-Israel groups to enact anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian censorship,"" the council wrote. ""We do not believe that the state of California should be restricting or censoring teachers when it comes to the teaching of ethnic studies – or any other subject matter.""

The state's largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, has already implemented an ethnic studies requirement for the graduating class of 2027, who are freshmen this year.

"‘Palestine from the river to the sea’ means ‘extermination’ of Israel, ex-counterterrorism official warns",2023-10-16,Fox News,['Maria Lencki'],"Atlantic Council senior fellow Nathan Sales calls on Americans to show support for the Jewish people on 'Sunday Night in America.'
When pro-Palestinian protesters chant ""Palestine from the river to the sea,"" they are really calling for the ""extermination of the Jewish state,"" one former counterterrorism coordinator warned.
""They think that Israel shouldn't exist at all,"" Nathan Sales told ""Sunday Night in America."" ""This is exterminationist rhetoric and our First Amendment means that we have to tolerate this kind of speech, but the antidote for that kind of abhorrent speech is more speech. We need to expose what these Hamas sympathizers are really all about."" 
Several American cities have seen protests against Israel by pro-Palestinian supporters since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. Instead of condemning Hamas, many have spoken out against Israel for military operations in besieged territory, citing civilian casualties.

Sales said now is the time Americans must ""stand strong with Israel.""
""The attack ... [is] the worst day for Israel in its 75-year history. It's the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. We've said, ‘Never again.’ Well, now is the time to show that we mean it and the way you show that you mean it is at least being out in the streets and showing support for Jews who are now looking over their shoulders and fearing for their lives.""
Sales called on the Biden administration to give their Middle Eastern ally the ""diplomatic space it needs."" 
""Israel has suffered one of the deadliest terrorist attacks the world has ever seen,"" he told FOX News. ""It needs to degrade and destroy Hamas to the point that it's no longer capable of threatening it militarily or acting as a quasi-government in Gaza. So, what we've heard from the administration is helpful words, but now it's time to see helpful deeds.""

""The first priority for any government is to secure its border, to protect its people and we're falling asleep at the job,"" he reflected.

""I’ve come across numerous messages, and I believe that it’s very important to address the situation in Israel with clarity. What is happening there is undeniably barbaric, acts of terrorism that cannot be softened with ‘buts’ or additional justifications. 
""The loss of innocent lives can never be justified by any means. It’s crucial to emphasize that these events have nothing to do with Islam.

"Massachusetts couple, 1-year-old son stranded in Gaza with little food, water, fuel, connectivity: attorney",2023-10-31,Fox News,['Landon Mion'],"Attorney Sammy Nabulsi says the family's circumstances continue to worsen each day they remain in Gaza.
A Massachusetts family has been stuck in Gaza for weeks amid the ongoing war between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists, and they are now without adequate resources – including food, water, fuel and connectivity – as they continue to look for a way home.
Abood Okal, Wafa Abuzayda and their 1-year-old son, Yousef, were visiting family in Gaza when Hamas launched its surprise attack against Israel on Oct. 7. The family, which had been in the region since late September, was initially planning to return to their home in Medway, Massachusetts, on Oct. 13.
Sammy Nabulsi, friend and attorney for the family, spoke with Fox News Digital about their situation on the ground in Gaza, which he described as ""extremely dangerous and dire,"" adding that their circumstances continue to worsen each day they remain in the region.
""Currently, the family is staying in a single-family home with 40 other people taking shelter,"" Nabulsi said. ""They're having to sleep on the floor, as they've been doing for a little over two weeks. Their chief concern has been access to water. A couple of times over the last week, they've run out of clean drinking water. They've had to resort to drinking salt water from a well that they have access to.""

""Another concern now on top of that is there hasn't been any access to fuel,"" he continued. ""They rely on diesel fuel to pull and pump the well water, which is just the running water that they have at this home, and also to filter it, which they've been unable to do because they've run out of fuel and have no access to any fuel. So there have been days when they've just had to drink salt water, unfiltered salt water, to stay hydrated.""
Nabulsi said the family told him over the weekend that they ran out of drinking water again and are now trying to figure out how they will access clean drinking water over the next few days. They are also completely out of cooking oil and fuel.
The family also has an extremely limited food supply and Nabulsi said he was told Sunday morning that they waited in line for six hours for some bread to share.
Additionally, Yousef, who turns two in December, relies primarily on milk as his main source of nutrition and the family ran out of milk a few days ago. They have been unsuccessful in their efforts to find milk in Rafah, which is the town they are currently staying in, or the nearby town of Khan Yunus.
FOREIGN OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM OVER LACK OF HUMANITARIAN AID IN GAZA AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR GROUND OPERATION
Okal said in an audio message to Nabulsi on Saturday that there were three airstrikes within 800 to 900 feet of the home they are at.
""There continue to be airstrikes in the town that they are staying in,"" Nabulsi said. ""And presumably, this is the same town where the other hundreds of American citizens who wish to cross into Egypt are currently located. So this family is in exceptionally dangerous circumstances at the moment.""
As many as 9,700 people have been killed on both sides of the war since Hamas launched its largest attack on the Jewish State in decades on Oct. 7, prompting retaliatory action from Israeli forces. The death toll in Israel includes at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 33 Americans. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says more than 8,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and 110 in the West Bank.
Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.
Nabulsi also spoke about the family's difficulty with connectivity over the weekend after cellular and internet service was cut for much of Gaza starting on Friday amid a heavy Israeli bombardment. Though connectivity was not easy before then due to reliance on solar-powered battery packs for their phones, Nabulsi said he had been able to reach the family three to five times a day from morning to early evening local time.
After communications were cut, Nabulsi was only able to reach the family about once a day.
Internet and phone service began gradually returning to Gaza on Sunday, and U.S. officials said they had pressured Israel to restore communications to the region.
The family's communications were limited, but possible, because they have U.S. phones and there is a field next to where they are staying that allows them to find a signal through Israeli telecommunication infrastructure if they walk far enough into the field. But, Nabulsi said, walking into the field has become dangerous because of concerns of being targeted or mistaken for a scout for Hamas or another group in the area.
""They've been approached by people they're staying with and neighbors [asking them] to stop going out into the field and making phone calls and trying to reach people in the United States,"" Nabulsi said.
SULLIVAN: ISRAEL SHOULD PROTECT GAZA CIVILIANS DESPITE HAMAS MAKING ‘LIFE DIFFICULT’ WITH HUMAN SHIELDS
Okal and Abuzayda feel ""hopeless and abandoned"" by the U.S. government, according to Nabulsi, because they say they have not received any information from the State Department or the White House about a departure option or timeline.
""They've done everything they've been asked to do,"" Nabulsi said.
The family has contacted the U.S. embassy in Cairo, Egypt, and Jerusalem, Israel, on a daily basis, signed up for every alert system the State Department has urged them to sign up for and they have been in contact with their elected officials.
""[The family] went down to Rafah when northern Gaza was evacuated, and they went to the Rafah Crossing every single time that the State Department has communicated an opportunity to them to do so, and at every single turn, they've not received any sort of help or assistance or even information from the U.S. government.,"" Nabulsi explained. ""They just feel completely abandoned, and they don't think that the United States is focused on this effort at all.""
Nabulsi pointed out the difference in how the U.S. government is handling the evacuation of Americans from Israel compared to the Americans stranded in Gaza as the State Department has organized charter flights from Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel and chartered cruise ships to move Americans from the ongoing violence.
""This has been my second-greatest frustration to just the fact there's no departure option for them is how stark the comparison has been between what the United States has done for American citizens in Israel versus what the United States has done for American citizens in Gaza,"" Nabulsi said. ""To me, at the outset of this and what has motivated me to get involved, has just been that a citizen is a citizen, is a citizen. Shouldn't matter which side of the wall they're on. They are entitled to safety and security by their own government.""

""There's been no departure option or plan or timeline for any of the American citizens in Gaza,"" he added. ""Our understanding at the moment is their only option is for them to cross at the Rafah Crossing into Egypt. I've not been made aware of any other options at the United States is looking at or considering. They appear to be putting all their eggs in this basket.""
The Pentagon said Monday that Hamas is preventing hundreds of Americans stuck in Gaza from leaving the region and the State Department also told Fox News Digital that Hamas has, at times, prevented people from approaching the Rafah Crossing. Nabulsi claims these statements from the U.S. government are different from what he has heard from the ground and through his private communications with the State Department.
A spokesperson for the State Department told Fox News Digital it continues to work urgently with Egypt, Israel and the United Nations to facilitate the ability for U.S. citizens and their families to safely leave Gaza and travel through Egypt to their final destinations. The spokesperson said it is unclear how many Americans are stranded in Gaza since they are not required to register their travel to a foreign country with the State Department, which previously estimated that as many as 600 Americans could be in the region.
According to the spokesperson, the security environment in Gaza is distinct from the security environment in Israel, making it harder to facilitate safe passage for Americans stuck in Gaza. The spokesperson emphasized, however, that the State Department's commitment to providing all possible consular assistance to U.S. citizens is unwavering, regardless of location, and that it remains in contact with U.S. citizens in Gaza.
VOLUNTEER VETERANS HELP EVACUATE HUNDREDS OF AMERICANS FROM ISRAEL AS COUNTRY'S GROUND OFFENSIVE NEARS
The Massachusetts family is staying in a home that is no more than a 10-minute drive away from the Rafah Crossing and had a vehicle they were planning to use to get to it. The State Department, Nabulsi said, has given the family three specific dates and times to arrive at the location to cross, yet each time they have arrived at the crossing, they aren't able to use it.
Nabulsi said he reviewed photos the family sent him that showed the only thing stopping people who wish to leave is the physical gate at the crossing as there are no Hamas terrorists at the location.
The only people at the crossing were Egyptian guards on the other side who informed people seeking evacuation that they had not been told to open up the crossing for them yet. After the third unsuccessful attempt at the crossing, which was the third time the State Department told the family of an opportunity to cross, Nabulsi reached out to contacts at the State Department who said the reason nobody was able to cross was that a three-way agreement with Egypt, Israel and the Hamas-run government in Gaza had not been reached.
""Each time this family has driven there to the crossing, waited six to eight hours only for not a single American citizen to cross,"" he said. ""And unfortunately, now that the fuel supply that they had is out, they don't have a way of driving there themselves. So the next time that there's an opportunity for them to cross into Egypt at the Rafah Crossing, they're either going to have to make that walk there with their 1-year-old son or try to find vehicular access through someone they can pay to take them there.""
The State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that securing passage through the Rafah Crossing is complicated since one side of the border crossing is controlled by Hamas, but that the department has no higher priority than assisting U.S. citizens, including those in Gaza.
Not long after President Biden announced a deal was in the works to deliver aid to Gaza, a 20-truck convoy carrying humanitarian assistance was facilitated by Egypt, Israel and the United Nations through the Rafah Crossing. The State Department spokesperson said it is continuing to work on delivering additional aid to Gaza.
Immediately after Biden announced aid was on the way, Nabulsi said he contacted the State Department and the White House National Security Council and was told that this deal did not include any provision for the evacuation of American citizens out of Gaza, but that they ""continued to hope that the deal might grease the wheels, so to speak, to get them out.""

""I don't know how the President of the United States goes to Israel, negotiates an aid deal and travels back to the United States without having first secured the safety and security of these American citizens, but since that time, there has been additional vehicular aid access into Egypt, but not a single American citizen has been able to leave,"" Nabulsi said. ""So I don't think the United States is doing anything as part of these aid discussions to ensure any sort of safe or immediate departure for the hundreds of American citizens stranded in Gaza at the moment.""
Nabulsi said he would like Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to give the same effort to securing the safe and immediate departure of American citizens in Gaza as they are giving to Americans in Israel and the American hostages being held by Hamas – two of whom have been released on humanitarian grounds.

""My bottom line here is that an American is an American is an American,"" Nabulsi said. ""None of them are worth more or less than the other. And my ask is to the administration to prioritize and to put effort into securing the safe departure of these American citizens. At the moment, it feels like, and this is what the family believes, that President Biden and the State Department are prioritizing aid to a foreign government, the destruction of a foreign territory, and frankly, the killing of foreign civilians all over the safety and security of American citizens.""

NY Times defends rehiring Gaza journalist who praised Hitler: He’s ‘maintained high journalistic standards’,2023-10-20,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"FOX News chief political analyst Brit Hume weighs in on the media's coverage of an explosion at a Gaza hospital.
The New York Times is defending its rehiring of a Gaza journalist who was previously exposed for praising Hitler.
The Times rehired freelance videographer Soliman Hijjy as part of its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. In August 2022, the pro-Israel media watchdog HonestReporting shed light on Hijjy, whose work had been featured by the Times between 2018 and 2021.
HonestReporting found that Hijjy praised Adolf Hitler in a 2012 Facebook post, writing, ""How great you are, Hitler"" in Arabic. 
In a 2018 post, Hijjy shared a photo of himself with a caption that translated to either ""I'm in tune like Hitler during the holocaust"" or ""in a state of harmony as Hitler was during the Holocaust.""
In a separate post, he referred to the terrorist group Hamas' rocket fire toward Israel as ""the resistance.""

At the time, a spokesperson for The Times told HonestReporting that it was looking into Hiijy's social media posts and declined to comment further in response to FOX News' inquiry. 
However, in the wake of Hamas' horrific Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, Hijjy's name has reemerged in the Times' coverage of the brewing war, as first pointed out by the Jewish newspaper Algemeiner. 
The Times is now standing by Hijjy. 
""We reviewed problematic social media posts by Mr. Hijjy when they first came to light in 2022 and took a variety of actions to ensure he understood our concerns and could adhere to our standards if he wished to do freelance work for us in the future,"" a spokesperson for the Times told FOX News Digital. ""Mr. Hijjy followed those steps and has maintained high journalistic standards. He has delivered important and impartial work at great personal risk in Gaza during this conflict.""
FOX News Digital asked multiple follow-up questions, including what were the Times' specific standards Hijjy was adhering to and how can he cover the Israel-Gaza conflict impartially when he has praised Hitler in the past. The Times spokesperson declined to comment further. 
MEDIA HAS EGG ON ITS FACE FOR ALLOWING HAMAS TO SET INITIAL TONE OF GAZA HOSPITAL COVERAGE WITHOUT SKEPTICISM

Hijjy has either had a byline or contributed to eight separate reports for the Times since Oct. 12, according to his author page. 
His work includes the Times' coverage of the explosion outside the Gaza hospital this week, which the Times' and many other media organizations reported was an Israeli airstrike, citing Hamas officials' false claims.

Hijjy's return to the Times is not being welcomed by critics. 
""The @nytimes has just rehired a NAZI. Let that sink in,"" Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan reacted. ""We all saw how the NYT immediately parroted Hamas’ lies regarding the al-Ahli hospital (which Hijjy contributed to) and still refuses to retract these fabrications. Spreading Hamas propaganda and rehiring a Holocaust-praising terror supporter, actively stokes antisemitism. Every Jew must understand that not reading or advertising in Hamas mouthpieces is an integral part of our right to self-defense.""

Fox News Poll: Voters overwhelmingly side with Israelis in ongoing conflict with Palestinians,2023-10-11,Fox News,['Victoria Balara'],"Israeli Entertainment TV host Romi Geyor gives an emotional testimony about the horrors she has witnessed in Israel as war rages against Hamas.
This is one of three Fox News Polls released Wednesday. See results of Fox News' polling on border security here and the 2024 presidential race here.
In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Israel, a new Fox News survey finds American voters are four times more likely to support the Israelis than the Palestinians in the ongoing conflict.
On Saturday morning, the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas launched an extensive terrorist attack against Israel, the grisly images and accounts of which have spread worldwide.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was at war on Saturday, and the government formally declared war on Sunday after a Cabinet vote.
The Fox survey was conducted Saturday-Monday.  It shows nearly 7 in 10 voters side with the Israelis (68%) in the conflict, while fewer than 2 in 10 side with the Palestinians (18%).
HAMAS BRUTALITY AGAINST ISRAELI INNOCENTS SHOCKS THE WORLD'S CONSCIENCE
That 50-point margin is significantly larger than the last time the question was asked in May 2021, when voters were 35 points more likely to back Israelis (59% vs. 24%).
The majority of voters are siding with Israelis amid the conflict in the Middle East, according to Fox News Polling. (Fox News)
The increase in support for Israel comes from more Democrats now siding with the Jewish state (59% vs. 42% in 2021).  Republicans (79% vs. 78%) held relatively steady in their backing of Israelis.
BIDEN SHUNS CALLS TO DE-ESCALATE, VOWS US ‘HAS ISRAEL’S BACK' FOR GROUND WAR WITH HAMAS
""The main reason for the overall increase in support for Israel is Democrats have dramatically changed their position,"" says Republican Daron Shaw who conducts the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""They've moved from +7 Israel to +34, which undoubtedly reflects revulsion over the nature of the attacks.""
Palestinians get support from a quarter of Democrats (25%) and 1 in 10 Republicans (11%). 
The majority of voters side with Israelis amid the conflict in the Middle East, according to Fox News Polling. (Fox News)
While voters of all ages back Israelis over Palestinians, there is an age gap:  voters over age 65 are more likely to support Israel by a 77-point margin while those under 30 back the Israelis over the Palestinians by just 8 points.
By a wide 80-11% margin, White evangelical Christians back the Israelis.

State Department official calls it quits after Biden says US will support Israel: ‘Policy disagreement’,2023-10-19,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst provides an inside look at an Israeli bomb shelter covered in blood and bullet holes after being hit by Hamas.
A Biden administration official has resigned from the State Department, citing President Biden's announcement of material support for Israel. The official said he ""cannot work"" as the U.S. helps Israel in its war against the Hamas terrorist group.
Josh Paul, who worked for the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, where he was responsible for transferring arms to key American allies, posted his resignation letter on social media. In it, he said ""continued lethal assistance to Israel"" prompted his decision to leave.
""Today I informed my colleagues that I have resigned from the State Department, due to a policy disagreement concerning our continued lethal assistance to Israel,"" Paul wrote on LinkedIn.
He added: ""I cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that I believe to be shortsighted, destructive, unjust, and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse.""

In the lengthy statement, Paul condemned Hamas’ brutal attack on Israeli civilians, but said Israel’s ""response"" in seeking to eliminate Hamas was too far.
""Let me be clear: Hamas’ attack on Israel was not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities,"" he wrote. ""I also believe that potential escalations by Iran-linked groups such as Hezbollah, or by Iran itself, would be a further cynical exploitation of the existing tragedy. But I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people — and is not in the long term American interest.""

His decision came as Biden announced the U.S. would be supplying weapons and munitions to Israel, its closest ally in the Middle East. Biden also said the U.S. stands unequivocally with Israel and its right to defend itself following Hamas’ ruthless assault on Oct. 7 that left more than 1,400 Israelis dead. It was the worst terror attack in the country’s history.
""When I came to the Bureau, the U.S. Government entity most responsible for the transfer and provision of arms to partners and allies, I knew it was not without its moral complexity and moral compromises, and I made myself a promise that I would stay for as long as I felt the harm I might do would be outweighed by the good I could do,"" Paul wrote. ""In my 11 years I have made more moral compromises than I can recall, each heavily, but each with my promise to myself in mind, and intact. I am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued — indeed, expanded and expedited — provision of lethal arms to Israel — I have reached the end of that bargain.""

""This Administration’s response — and much of Congress’ as well — is an impulsive reaction built on confirmation bias, political convenience, intellectual bankruptcy, and bureaucratic inertia,"" Paul continued in the statement. ""That is to say, it is immensely disappointing, and entirely unsurprising. Decades of the same approach have shown that security for peace leads to neither security nor peace.""

Biden’s stance on the conflict includes wholly supporting Israel while ensuring aid is given to civilians caught in the crossfire. On Wednesday, he announced $100 million in humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The president said the aid would be cut off if it fell into the hands of Hamas.
According to his LinkedIn, Paul has worked at the State Department since April 2012.

Pro-Palestinian group posts NYC map of locations ‘tied’ to ‘Genocide’ in Gaza: ‘Globalize the Intifada’,2023-11-16,Fox News,['Adam Sabes'],"Israeli Minister of Economy and Industry Nir Barkat joins 'Your World with Neil Cavuto' to discuss the latest in the Israel-Hamas war.
A pro-Palestinian group posted a picture of multiple locations around New York City it alleges are associated with the ""genocide"" in Gaza.
The group, Within Our Lifetime, posted the map which was later deleted, with a headline of ""From Palestine to NYC. Globalize the Intifada,"" according to the New York Post. The map stated that the locations were considered zones ""of direct action.""
""Each of the sites on this map is tied to the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the settler-colonization of Palestine. They reflect a network of dispossession, policing, prisons, surveillance, counterinsurgency, war, destruction, imperialism and militarization across the globe, with the mass media complex which manufactures consent for genocide acting as tools of the oppressor. These sites are also multi-purpose assets for some of the system's most powerful perpetrators of violence. May this map serve as a call for every struggle to act in their own interest. As we do so, we uplift one another's struggles and free Palestine from the river to the sea,"" the map reads.

Here’s where Students for Justice in Palestine held college protests this week,2023-10-13,Fox News,['Brian Flood'],"Demonstrators clash at dueling Israeli and Palestinian rallies at Columbia University in New York City, New York on Thursday, October 12, 2023. (Julia Bonavita/Fox News Digital)
The national chapter of the far-left group Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) posted a ""call to action"" on social media Sunday and asked their student chapters to hold demonstrations at their colleges in support of the Palestinians. Since then, an assortment of colleges and universes across America have held events in support of the Palestinians following the terrorist attacks in Israel carried out by Hamas. 
SJP chapters held protests at the following schools:

Chapters at Michigan State University and University of Mary Washington planned off-campus events. 
The Israeli government declared war against Hamas on Saturday after the terrorist group fired thousands of rockets out of Gaza and invaded, killing over 1,200 Israelis and taking hostages, including soldiers, women, children and older civilians.
The terrorist attacks in Israel carried out by Hamas have polarized colleges and universities since Saturday. Shortly after the devastating terror attacks in Israel, Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups released its statement signed by 27 different organizations that blamed Israel entirely for the attacks and voiced support for Palestinians in Gaza. Pro-Israel college students and Harvard alumni have condemned the statement. 
THEY'RE ‘CELEBRATING’ A ‘MASSACRE OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS’: JEWISH COLLEGE STUDENTS DENOUNCE ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST
Earlier this week, the national chapter of SJP celebrated the attack as a ""historic win"" for the ""Palestinan resistance"" in a call to action to chapters across the country.
""Today, we witness a historic win for the Palestinian resistance: across land, air, and sea, our people have broken down the artificial barriers of the Zionist entity, taking with it the facade of an impenetrable settler colony and reminding each of us that total return and liberation to Palestine is near,"" the account wrote. ""Catching the enemy completely by surprise, the Palestinian resistance has captured over a dozen settlements surrounding Gaza along with many occupation soldiers and military vehicles. This is what it means to Free Palestine: not just slogans and rallies, but armed confrontation with the oppressors.""

DeSantis deactivates Students for Justice in Palestine; says giving ‘material support for terror’ is illegal,2023-10-28,Fox News,['Charles Creitz'],"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tells 'Life, Liberty & Levin' the pro-Palestinian groups cannot be allowed to operate in the United States.
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis suggested that some of the activities of pro-Palestinian student groups may be violating federal law. The governor added that in response to Students for Justice's support for the Palestinians in the wake of the attack on Israel, he is going to ""deactivate"" the group in his state.
Pro-Hamas protests have cropped up in urban areas across the country, from large cities like New York and Washington to places like Allentown, Pa., where Muslim activists rallied this week at a monument dedicated to Pennsylvania's Civil War volunteers to declare purported ""Gaza genocide"" at the hands of Israel.
However, across Europe there have been prohibitions on such activity, including in Germany, where police reportedly cracked down on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near Berlin's Brandenburg Gate this week.
In Florida, DeSantis said he has tried to curb the activities of groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine, telling FOX News he ordered the states' universities to disband chapters on their campuses.

""If you look at how Florida's universities respond to this for our college presidents, you didn't see them behave like Harvard president and [officials at the University of Pennsylvania]. They put out a very clear statement saying that what Hamas did was barbaric, that we stand with Israel and that we are going to make sure that our Jewish students are able to … be protected on our campuses,"" he said.
DeSantis called the pro-Palestinian student group ""very radical"" and claimed some involved don't delineate themselves from the governing terrorist group Hamas itself.
""They say we're not standing in solidarity with Hamas. They say they are the same movement,"" he said.
Therefore, he posited, it is different to be protesters who are in support of a wrongful or controversial entity than it is to consider oneself one-in-the-same.
REP. MILLS FLIES TO ISRAEL TO HELP RESCUE AMERICANS: DOING JOB ‘BIDEN FAILED AT TWICE’
""You don't have a First Amendment right to provide material support to terrorists. So we have deactivated the Students for Justice in Palestine groups on university campuses and our state university system in the state of Florida. And I think we're the first state to do that,"" he said, in an apparent nod to a federal law – 18 USC 2339b – that deems ""providing material support or resources to foreign terrorist organizations"" illegal.
DeSantis added he would do the same at the federal level as he has at the state level in terms of groups tied to or considering themselves consubstantial with designated terror groups.

He said he called on President Biden to do so but is not anticipating a response.
""Some of these people that are demonstrating in favor of Hamas terrorism – and these demonstrations started before the blood was even dry of these Israeli civilians who were massacred – they immediately were praising this,"" he said, adding that some protesters are foreign nationals on student visas.
Those students, he posited, no longer have a right to be in the United States.
""That's a privilege. I will cancel that visa and I will send you home.""

"Hero dogs: Israel’s canine unit saved lives by spotting Hamas terror traps, saved civilians near Gaza Strip",2023-12-02,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"The IDF's Oketz canine unit working in the Gaza Strip. The unit is seen clearing out explosives and finding weapons during the ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. (Video: IDF Spokesman's Unit.)
Israel’s specialized canine unit, Oketz, performed the key task of saving the lives of civilians and soldiers by alerting them to potential dangers, including explosives and weapon caches, even at the expense of their own lives. 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) boasts one of the most cutting-edge fighting forces, having integrated artificial intelligence into many of its operations, but some tasks still require an old-school approach. This is where the Oketz unit makes its mark.
""There are a few types of dogs used by the unit, some are confidential, most of them are types of [shepherds],"" an officer known as ""Major A,"" an operative canine warfare school commander for the Oketz unit, told Fox News Digital.
""They are used for three main reasons: tactical dogs that are used to identify enemies; explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) dogs for finding explosives and others; and search and rescue dogs that took a vital part in this war in Israel and Gaza,"" Major A said.

Major A could not divulge how many dogs serve in the unit – the total remaining confidential – but he said it has counted ""hundreds of dogs.""
Video provided by the IDF shows the dogs in action: in one clip, identifying a booby-trapped car; in another, clearing a room before soldiers enter.
The Oketz unit helped the Marom Special Operations Brigade expose roughly 50 booby-trapped explosive devices and dozens of weapons stockpiles before the four-day cease-fire, which has now extended two more days as Hamas continues to release hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli custody and further pauses in the fighting.

The dogs also helped rescue more than 200 civilians under fire near the Gaza Strip, the New York Post reported. A canine named Naro even alerted the IDF to a planned Hamas ambush while on a mission near the kibbutz of Kfar Aza.
Naro died in the ensuing gunfight – one of the few members of the Oketz unit that have died since the war started.
Major A said dog deaths in the unit ""in routine"" remain rare, with approximately one to two deaths per year, but that wartime is a different story.

""In this specific war we have unfortunately lost five dogs already, which provided a huge contribution to the war effort and saved many soldiers' lives,"" Major A said.
The four other dogs died defending soldiers in the Gaza Strip itself: Mido, Taiga, Jack and Ghandi. The dogs will be buried in the Oketz unit cemetery, according to protocol, an IDF spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

"US, Israel unsure how many Hamas hostages are ‘still alive,’ Jake Sullivan says",2023-11-12,Fox News,['Anders Hagstrom'],"FOX News contributor Douglas Murray joined ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss his experience visiting the Hamas massacre site and the surge in anti-Israel protests.
The U.S. and Israel are unsure of how many hostages that Hamas terrorists took on Oct. 7 are ""still alive,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.
Sullivan made the comments during an appearance on ABC's ""This Week."" He said the U.S. remains focused on securing the release of the nine U.S. citizens and one U.S. green card-holder believed to be in Hamas custody. He said that while Israel is classifying all 239 missing individuals as hostages of Hamas, there is no way to be sure how many of them are ""still alive.""
""We do not know the precise number of hostages. We know the number of missing, and that's the number the Israelis have given, but we don't know how many of those are still alive,"" Sullivan told ABC. ""As far as Americans are concerned, there are nine missing American citizens as well as a missing legal permanent resident--a green card holder.""
Sullivan said he will be meeting with family members of the missing Americans later this week.

Sullivan was later asked about claims from Hamas that Israeli airstrikes have killed a number of hostages taken on Oct. 7. He responded that no claims by Hamas should be taken at face value, but also said the U.S. has no way to disprove or confirm the claim.

UN refugee agency: Gaza becoming a ‘hellhole’ on the ‘brink of collapse’,2023-10-13,Fox News,['Timothy H.J. Nerozzi'],"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The United Nations refugee agency for Palestinians said the situation in Gaza is dire, as Israeli forces issued a call to evacuate more than 1 million civilians living in the territory's north.
United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini called the evacuation order ""horrendous"" in a statement predicting the escalating Israeli response to Hamas terror attacks will ""lead to unprecedented levels of misery and push people in Gaza into the abyss."" 
Lazzarini said more than 423,000 Gaza citizens have been displaced since the outbreak of war on Saturday, more than 270,000 of which have taken refuge in UNRWA shelters.

Israel Defense Forces told Fox News' Trey Yingst that Israeli forces entered the Gaza Strip Friday, both infantry forces and tanks, to conduct localized raids. 
The Israeli military said the raids were an effort to eliminate militants along the border and gather information about those held hostage inside the Gaza Strip.
""The scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone-chilling. Gaza is fast becoming a hellhole and is on the brink of collapse,"" he said.

Lazzarini echoed other U.N. officials who have called for an end to the war. 
""I urge all parties and those with influence over them to put an end to this tragedy and provide immediate and unconditional humanitarian access and protection to the civilians, among them far too many women and children,"" Lazzarini said.

Israel has called up some 360,000 military reservists to respond to the Hamas-led terror campaign. Those forces have gathered on Israel's border with Gaza ahead of a possible full-scale invasion to reclaim the hostages and eliminate Hamas terrorists. 
Israel has warned the 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza to evacuate the area within 24 hours as a ""humanitarian step in order to minimize civilian casualties"" ahead of the military's response to Hamas' terrorist attacks.

"Heritage urges Mike Johnson to 'hold firm' against Biden's $106 billion Ukraine, Israel request",2023-12-05,Fox News,['Elizabeth Elkind'],"FOX News’ Jennifer Griffin reports the Pentagon is ‘just barely’ keeping up as Congress debates the defense budget and gives an update on Sen. Tuberville's military promotion blockade.
EXCLUSIVE: A top conservative group affiliated with the Heritage Foundation is pushing Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to keep President Biden’s $106 billion supplemental aid request from coming to the House floor. 
""Please do not undermine the gains that have been made on behalf of the American people by substituting one corrupt, unaffordable end-of-year deal for another. Hold firm to the convictions you and I and the American people share in common,"" Heritage Action President Dr. Kevin Roberts wrote to Johnson.
He was particularly critical of the roughly $61 billion requested for Ukraine, a topic that has become a lightning rod within the GOP.
The package would include funding for Israel, Ukraine, the U.S. border, and humanitarian efforts, among other items. Republicans in both the House and Senate have warned that such a package would fail on its own.
ZELENSKYY TO ADDRESS US SENATORS DURING CLASSIFIED BRIEFING ON STALLED MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE, ISRAEL

""It is no surprise that President Biden and Senate Democrats would pursue such a reckless, aimless and feckless course. Sadly, it is also not surprising that a small number of Republican senators would join them. However, it is alarming to read reports that congressional Republicans are actively courting this supplemental spending package,"" Roberts wrote.
On the House side, Johnson has made clear that he does not want to put the $106 billion package on the floor – he passed the roughly $14 billion in Israel aid as a standalone bill, with the money taken from the IRS, and has called for pairing the Ukraine aid with stricter border security measures and asylum laws.
UKRAINE TO RECEIVE NATO SUPPORT FOR 'AS LONG AS IT TAKES,' GAIN ALLIANCE MEMBERSHIP AFTER CONFLICT
Ukrainian officials are visiting Capitol Hill on Tuesday as the situation for Kyiv’s fight against Russia threatens to grow dire without more U.S. aid. It comes after the White House’s Office of Management and Budget wrote a letter to congressional leaders warning that Ukraine will suffer serious losses if new U.S. aid is not approved this year. 
Johnson responded to that letter on Tuesday morning that ""supplemental Ukraine funding is dependent upon enactment of transformative change to our nation’s border security laws.""

But conservatives, including a growing number within the House and Senate GOP, are skeptical of the continued flow of foreign aid without confidence that the war has an end point. 
Roberts accused Biden’s funding request for Ukraine of being overbroad, criticizing U.S. aims to help rebuild its war-ravaged economy.
""The House of Representatives should strongly oppose aid to Ukraine when the European Union, which lags far behind the United States in its military assistance to Ukraine, should be required to fund greater levels of aid for Ukraine,"" he wrote.
HOUSE PASSES BILL TO STOP FEDERAL FUNDS BEING USED TO HOUSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
""Additionally, any military funding for Ukraine should include a publicly available accounting of how the U.S. contribution so far has been used in Ukraine,"" he continued. ""It should also be debated and considered on its own merits and be legitimately paid for, and not cloaked in so-called ‘emergency’ accounting gimmicks or combined with other funding provisions.""
""Furthermore, aid for Ukraine should not be provided until the administration provides a plan that defines the end goal in Ukraine, describes the expected U.S. commitment to achieve that goal, addresses the effects of the presidential drawdown authority on U.S. capabilities, and assures further commitments from our European partners. None of this will be included in the Senate’s supplemental package.""

He also reminded Johnson of conservative calls to pair any Ukraine aid with the House GOP’s H.R. 2 border and illegal immigration bill, something the Democrat-dominated White House and Senate have panned as a nonstarter.
Roberts met with Johnson to talk about the aims in the letter on Monday afternoon, Fox News Digital was told. A source familiar with their discussion categorized it as productive.

Columbia University professor describes Hamas terrorist attacks as ‘indigenous Palestinian resistance’,2023-10-11,Fox News,['Joshua Q. Nelson'],"FOX News' Jennifer Griffin reports the latest on the Israel-Hamas war.
A Columbia University professor on Sunday described the Hamas-Israel war as an ""indigenous Palestinian resistance"" against a ""colonial army.""
Joseph Massad, a professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University, wrote an article highlighting the efforts of Hamas fighters invading Israel on October 7.
The effort, Massad writes, consisted of more than two dozen battle sites, which entailed Hamas conquering ""50 Israeli military targets"" for its Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.
Hamas’ storming of Israeli checkpoints separating Gaza from Israel was ""astounding,"" Massad described in a section of the article titled ""Jubilation and awe."" 
ISRAEL AT WAR WITH HAMAS AFTER SURPRISE ATTACKS, AROUND 1,000 ISRAELIS DEAD

Massad added that Hamas' campaign was also astounding to the Israelis as well as the Palestinian and Arab peoples who emerged across the region to show support for their Palestinian counterparts in their battle against their ""cruel colonizers.""
Massad said that the operation was a retaliation for ""ongoing Israeli pogroms in the West Bank town of Huwwara and Jerusalem."" A pogrom is a Russian word describing an organized massacre of a particular ethnic, religious, racial, or national minority group that is either approved or condoned by state authorities.
Furthermore, he noted specifically Israel settlers stormed the al-Aqsa mosque during the Jewish High Holy Days over the last month.
""The sight of the Palestinian resistance fighters storming Israeli checkpoints separating Gaza from Israel was astounding, not only to the Israelis but especially to the Palestinian and Arab peoples who came out across the region to march in support of the Palestinians in their battle against their cruel colonizers,"" Massad wrote.
Toward the end of the article, Massad wrote, ""But as the ongoing war between the Israeli colonial army and the indigenous Palestinian resistance has only just begun, the days to come will surely be crucial in determining if this is the start of the Palestinian War of Liberation or yet another battle in the interminable struggle between the colonizer and the colonized.""

The Russian president previously claimed the ""problem"" that Israel and the Palestinians are facing is the result of U.S. foreign policy in reference to settlements in Israel.
""Settlement mechanisms have been established, but the United States has neglected these mechanisms over the past few years and decided to regulate everything on its own, did not use these mechanisms and in recent years has relied on meeting the material needs of the population living in the Palestinian territories,"" Putin said during a forum with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Sudani on Wednesday.
He added, ""In fact, they tried to replace the solution of fundamental political problems with some material handouts. Of course, this is very important for people who have a low standard of living, it is important to solve socio-economic issues.""

‘Squad’ Democrats vote against condemning ‘barbaric’ Hamas attack on Israel,2023-10-25,Fox News,['Brandon Gillespie'],"2024 presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott explains his call to remove foreign students supporting terrorism on ‘Your World.’
A group of House Democrats made up primarily of far-left ""Squad"" members voted against a resolution Wednesday to condemn the ""barbaric"" Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists.
H.R. 771, which reaffirms America's support for Israel as it responds to the attack, received overwhelming bipartisan support and passed by a vote of 412-10 with six members voting present.
The 10 members voting against the resolution included six of the eight ""Squad"" members: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., Summer Lee, D-Pa., and Cori Bush, D-Mo. They were joined by Reps.

One Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted against the resolution over concerns it could deepen the conflict, but explicitly condemned the attack by Hamas and affirmed Israel's right to defend itself unlike some members of the ""Squad.""
The vote came just hours after newly-elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., vowed his first action would be to bring the resolution the floor as a statement in support of Israel.

Last week, Omar broke down in a fit of rage aimed at President Biden and Democrat leadership over their support for Israel amid the war with Hamas. Her angry comments came during a press conference with fellow ""Squad"" members calling for a ceasefire in the war.

Sen. Peter Welch says Israel ground invasion would ‘exacerbate’ conditions in Gaza: ‘Grave concerns’,2023-10-24,Fox News,['Landon Mion'],"Jerusalem deputy mayor Fleur Hassan-Nahoum discusses connections the Israeli people share on ‘FOX News @ Night.’
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said Monday he has ""grave concerns"" about Israel's potential ground invasion into Gaza amid an ongoing war prompted by Hamas' terror attack on the Jewish State.
In a statement released Monday, Welch said he has ""grave concerns about the wisdom and military efficacy"" of an Israeli ground invasion in Gaza and that there is ""no doubt"" an imminent ground invasion would be ""catastrophic for innocent Palestinians in Gaza and jeopardize urgent efforts to save hostages.""
""Israel has the absolute right to attack Hamas for the brutal, heinous slaughter of more than 1,400 Israelis and the taking of more than 200 hostages,"" Welch wrote. ""But, Israel also has a responsibility to protect Palestinian civilians living in Gaza, including one million children. Already, more than 5,000 Palestinians have died.""
More than 5,700 people have been killed and thousands more wounded in Gaza and Israel since Hamas launched its largest attack against Israel in decades on Oct. 7, leading Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare war on the terrorist group.
TWO AMERICAN HOSTAGES RELEASED FROM GAZA, FOX NEWS IS TOLD

Israel has indicated it will be conducting a ground invasion into Gaza to attack Hamas, although there is no definitive timetable on when such an attack would begin.
Hamas has taken more than 220 people hostage, but at least four have been released thus far, including two Americans who were freed last week. The Israeli military told The Times of Israel that it is concerned additional hostage releases by Hamas could lead the political leadership to delay a ground invasion or stop it midway.
U.S. and international officials, lawmakers and humanitarian aid groups have expressed concerns about the conditions in Gaza after Israel cut off water and fuel supply to the region following Hamas' initial attack.
""The humanitarian conditions in Gaza are terrible and getting worse every day,"" Welch said in his statement. ""One million Palestinians, including women and children, have been displaced. Most are living in the open—without food, without shelter, fuel, water, or access to medicine. United Nations relief efforts have begun but are unable to meet the extreme needs of the moment.""
""A ground invasion would further exacerbate the dire conditions in Gaza,"" Welch concluded.

Last week, Welch and fellow Democrat Sens. Brian Schatz, of Hawaii, and Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, wrote a letter to Biden urging that ""every effort be made to avoid civilian harm and to allow access to humanitarian aid for those in need,"" including restoring access to food, electricity, water, fuel and medicine to civilians in Gaza and establishing a humanitarian corridor to allow aid into Gaza and safe passage for U.S. citizens who wish to evacuate the region.
The international community has been working to supply civilians of Gaza with humanitarian aid in the wake of the violence in the region. Egypt, Israel and the United Nations facilitated a 20-truck convoy carrying humanitarian assistance that was delivered to Gaza through the Rafah border crossing last week.

President Biden and five other Western leaders said in a joint statement Sunday that they ""welcomed the announcement of the first humanitarian convoys to reach Palestinians in need in Gaza and committed to continue coordinating with partners in the region to ensure sustained and safe access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance required to meet humanitarian needs.""

"‘Pay for slay’: Palestinian Authority may have to compensate families of Hamas terrorists, report says",2023-10-19,Fox News,['Ruth Marks Eglash'],"Israeli Defense Forces Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said Israel remained committed to defeating the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza, saying it will use 'all the tools we have.'
JERUSALEM — There are growing fears among Israelis and some Palestinians that, according to a controversial law aimed at rewarding Palestinians who murder Israelis in ""nationalistic attacks,"" the Palestinian Authority may be compelled to shell out nearly $3 million a month in compensation to the families of hundreds of Hamas terrorists who carried out the deadly massacre against Israel on October 7th. 
According to Israeli military estimates, nearly 3,000 Hamas terrorists infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip during the attack, murdering, raping and even beheading more than 1,300 civilians and Israeli soldiers. 
As the IDF fought to regain control over the dozens of towns and communities that sit close to the border with the Palestinian enclave, it reportedly killed more than 1,500 of the terrorists and captured an additional 100 or more. 
Palestinian Media Watch, an Israeli organization that draws attention to Palestinian extremism, including among its leaders, surmised in an article published on its website Tuesday that the Palestinian Authority, the body that governs Palestinians in the West Bank, may now be obliged to pay salaries to the families of the dead terrorists and fund those who are now being held by Israel.

Marcus claimed the controversial payments, which are often referred to by critics as ""pay for slay,"" have been steadfastly defended by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and members of his government. And he said they are applicable to any Palestinian who ""dies as a martyr from any faction, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad.""
""The Palestinian Authority has been adamant about paying these salaries,"" said Marcus, adding that the payments continue to be made even though the Palestinian Authority has been forced to slash salaries across the board for all government workers due to an economic crisis in the Palestinian territories, sparking protests.

President Abbas had been scheduled to meet with President Biden in Jordan Wednesday but canceled after a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza Tuesday night reportedly killed and injured hundreds. He has yet to outright condemn Hamas’ atrocities Oct. 7. 
Palestinian news agency WAFA reported last week that Abbas had stressed that the Palestine Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinian people. However, he stopped short of condemning Hamas’ brutal actions. Hamas is not represented in the PLO due to an ongoing rivalry with Fatah, Abbas’ political faction. 
HAMAS CLAIMS IT WILL 'PROTECT' HOSTAGES, RELEASE THEM 'WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE GROUND ALLOW'
Lt. Col. (res) Shaul Bartal, a senior researcher at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv, said it was unlikely the Palestinian Authority would find the funds to extend this policy to the families of such a large number of terrorists.

""Right now, the PA does not have the money to pay them even if they wanted to, and Abbas has already said that what Hamas did does not represent the Palestinian people,"" he said. He added that due to the dire financial situation in the West Bank, the PA has already ceased paying salaries to employees in the Gaza Strip.
However, Marcus pointed out that, following the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, in which a large number of Palestinian terrorists were killed, residents in Gaza demanded the Palestinian Authority extend the compensation to them.
Abbas and the Palestinian Authority have received sharp criticism for these payments, which include a bonus in the first month and then a monthly stipend that increases with time. 
In 2018, in a sign of protest, Congress passed the Taylor Force Act aimed at cutting economic aid to the Palestinian Authority until it ends the payment policy. In addition, Israel, which collects some taxes on commerce and income on behalf of the Palestinian governing body, has also passed a similar law. 
Taylor Force was a West Point graduate who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was pursuing his MBA at Vanderbilt, and the 28-year-old was savagely knifed to death March 8, 2016, during a tour of Israel by a Palestinian terrorist. President Trump signed the Taylor Force Act into law in October 2018.

Even with the new law, Palestinian Media Watch said the Palestinian Authority law continues to award the family of every terrorist who is killed attacking Israel an immediate grant of $1,511 and a $353-per-month allowance for life.Bassem Eid, a Palestinian human rights activist and political analyst, said this ""pay-to-slay policy has put a huge financial burden on the Palestinian Authority, and yet they continue to demand more financial aid from the Europeans and the Americans.
""In my opinion, the Palestinian Authority is using this policy to encourage more terror against Jews and Israelis,"" Eid told Fox News Digital. ""The international community knows this money is going to terror via the Palestinian Authority, but they continue to accept it.""

However, Eid said he did not believe Abbas would ""pay any money to Hamas terrorists"" after this month's attack. More likely, he said, Hamas would reward its own fighters directly.

Support for Hamas vs Israel among college-age students shows generational divide: Poll,2023-10-24,Fox News,['Ashley Carnahan'],"Former Clinton adviser Mark Penn offers insight into the results of a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll that found a generational gap in support for Israel on 'The Story.'
A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll conducted last week found a majority of American voters side more with Israel than Hamas, but college-age students are narrowing the gap. 
The poll was conducted online Oct. 18 through 19 among 2,116 registered voters and held a margin of error of +/- 2%. 
When voters were asked who they sided with more in the Israel-Hamas conflict, 95% of voters ages 65 and older said Israel, while only 5% said Hamas. 
In the 18-24 age range, 52% said Israel while 48% said Hamas.

The average percentage of support for Israel over Hamas from the 25-64 range was 82%. 
Former Clinton adviser and chairman of the Harris Poll Mark Penn said the ""enormous"" gap was indicative of a generational divide.

""When they say, 'from the river to the sea,' they're talking about the annihilation of the Jewish state, you know, of 9 million people, something most of them don't even support when you ask them in the poll,"" he told anchor Martha MacCallum. ""But they're out there chanting things that they don't understand. It’s an enormous disconnect because the information base, as you say, do they really understand the Holocaust? Do they understand what happened in World War II? Do they understand how Israel was formed and what the Jewish people are and how it is their homeland?""
""No, it doesn't appear that they have the basic facts compared to the older generation. The younger generation, remember, didn't even live through 9/11. They don't even have a basic understanding of terrorism and how it has affected us here let alone those in Israel,"" he continued.

"In wake of Hamas attack, western protests, Republicans increase focus on legal immigration limits",2023-10-29,Fox News,['Adam Shaw'],"FOX News correspondent Steve Harrigan has the latest on the Middle East conflict on on Special Report.
In the wake of the Hamas terror attack against Israel, and anti-Israel protests erupting across the country, some Republicans are shifting their attention on immigration away from the border and onto stopping foreign nationals who express anti-Israel or pro-Hamas views from getting into the U.S. legally as well.
The Hamas terror attacks immediately drew attention from conservatives and Republicans to the southern border, and the risk of terrorists getting in through past Border Patrol. 
However, both the attacks and protests that emerged in college campuses and cities throughout the U.S. also raised new questions about potential restrictions on legal immigration — including in the refugee process. 
2024 presidential candidates and GOP lawmakers have called for the U.S. to no longer accept refugees from Gaza. Reps. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., and Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., introduced legislation that would block anyone from Gaza being admitted as a refugee, while multiple 2024 candidates have promised to do the same.
GOP LAWMAKERS CALL FOR PRO-HAMAS STUDENT VISA HOLDERS TO BE DEPORTED: ‘NOT WELCOME HERE’

""I don’t know what Biden’s going to do, but we cannot accept people from Gaza into this country as refugees,"" presidential candidate Ron DeSantis said during an event. ""If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they are all antisemitic. None of them believe in Israel’s right to exist.""
""We aren’t bringing in anyone from Gaza,"" former President Donald Trump said recently.
Separately, multiple lawmakers and 2024 candidates have come out in favor of revoking visas of foreign nationals who are seen to have celebrated Hamas at student protests and elsewhere. That echoes similar moves in Europe, where there have also been calls to yank visas from foreigners spouting pro-Hamas rhetoric.
In the U.S., Reps. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., have written to the administration calling for Hamas supporters to be deported. In the Senate, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has introduced legislation to cancel visas for foreign nationals who ""endorse or espouse terrorist activity.""
HOUSE GOP MEMBERS INTRODUCE BILL TO BLOCK PALESTINIAN REFUGEES FROM ENTERING US
""America is the most generous nation on earth, but we cannot allow foreign nationals who support terrorist groups like Hamas and march in our streets calling for ‘intifada’ to enter or stay in our country,"" Rubio said in a press release. 
It marks an emphasis shift of immigration priorities that have, for most Republicans, focused predominantly on illegal immigration and the southern border since the eruption of the migrant crisis in 2021. But legal immigration restrictions were a key part of the Trump administration — including the travel ban against predominantly Muslim countries, a slashing of refugee caps down to 18,000 a year, and efforts to implement additional screening of immigrants. Many of those efforts have been reversed by the Biden administration, with the refugee cap now at 125,000 a year.
Trump has promised a number of overhauls to legal immigration if re-elected, including the expansion of the travel bans for mainly majority-Muslim countries and a ramping up of ideological screening for all those coming into the U.S.
Stephen Miller, the former Trump White House advisor who played a central role in those restrictions during the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital that he welcomed the increased attention on legal immigration from fellow Republicans, but wants to see more.
DOZENS OF PRO-PALESTINIAN UNIVERSITY STUDENT CHAPTERS CELEBRATE ATTACK ON ISRAEL: ‘NOT UNPROVOKED’
""I think there is now a tragically long overdue realization that we have made it far too easy in this country for people to get student visas, green cards, work visas, tourist visas, etc., who not only don't support the value system of our country, but actively reject it — so hazardous is that is passed on to second and third generation immigrants and so it becomes a multi-generational problem.""
Miller, who is supporting President Trump for re-election in 2024, said he doesn’t believe the calls from Republicans for limits on refugees from Gaza go far enough.

""We got to where we are already in our current state over a period of many decades by accepting refugees from all over the world,"" he said. ""So this is not just a one country or a two country or a three country problem. This is a global problem."" 
Miller wants to see a complete suspension of the refugee program and ""the aggressive denial of visas to people in every country who fail to support our way of thinking in America.""
""The correct number of immigrants to bring into our country who hate America, hate Jews or hate the West is zero,"" he said.

Columbia shuts down event justifying Hamas massacre as ‘counteroffensive’,2023-12-04,Fox News,['Danielle Wallace'],"Protesters chanting ""Hillary, Hillary you can't hide, you are supporting genocide,"" confronted the former secretary of state outside her Columbia University class in New York City. (Credit: CSJP via Storyful | Ifrah Maskan via Storyful)
Columbia University's administration has shut down a pro-Palestinian student group's planned discussion that aimed to justify Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre of Israeli civilians, Fox News Digital learned Monday. 
A group that calls themselves the ""Columbia Social Workers 4 Palestine"" was advertising an event to discuss the ""Significance of the October 7th Palestinian Counteroffensive."" 
What would have been the group’s second so-called ""teach-in and discussion"" had been advertised to be taking place in a room of the Columbia School of Social Work on Wednesday between 12-1:50 p.m., according to a flier that circulated on social media. 
""We will discuss the significance of the Palestinian counteroffensive on October 7th and the centrality of revolutionary violence to anti-imperialism. See y’all there!"" Columbia Social Workers 4 Palestine wrote on X, sharing the flier with imagery of a dove and a red Palestinian poppy placed in the barrel of a rifle aimed at broken chains. ""In advocating for Palestinian liberation, Palestinians have engaged in nonviolent resistance tactics for years. These peaceful actions have been met with tear gas and armed opposition by the Israeli government."" 
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT PRAISES 'PERSISTENCE' OF STUDENTS ACCUSED OF ANTISEMITISM
X’s community notes added context, writing, ""October 7 was not a ‘counteroffensive.’ There was a ceasefire in place that Hamas broke on Oct. 7., when it launched thousands of rockets, invading Israel, and committing hundreds of war crimes. The term ‘counteroffensive’ applies to Israel’s response, not the Hamas attack."" 
Now, however, it appears the event will not be going on as planned, at least not at its original location.
""We learned late last night of a flier and accompanying text being circulated about a December 6th event at the Columbia School of Social Work (CSSW). This is not a CSSW-sponsored event,"" Melissa Begg, the dean of Columbia School of Social Work, said in a statement to Fox News Digital on Monday. 
""The students who organized the event did not seek approval for the fliers and text as required by CSSW processes. CSSW supports free speech but does not condone language that promotes violence in any manner, which is antithetical to our values. This event will not go forward at CSSW,"" Begg added.

Israel launched airstrikes and a ground offensive, which the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry says have killed more than 15,500 people as of Monday. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, and Hamas is known to operate out of a tunnel network beneath key infrastructure, including hospitals.
A week-long cease-fire agreement brought the exchange of dozens of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.

White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Sunday placed the blame on Hamas for ending the cease-fire by failing to add women and children who Israeli and U.S. forces know to have been taken hostage to the list of those to be released by the terror group. Israel said on Friday that 136 hostages remain in Gaza. Of them, either eight or nine are Americans, according to Kirby. 
Last month, Columbia University's administration banned Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace after the two far-left student groups held an unsanctioned demonstration calling for a cease-fire in Gaza that the university said ""included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.""

More than 20 progressive elected officials, including New York Democrats Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jamaal Bowman and Nydia Velázquez, reportedly sent a letter to the university calling for the reinstatement of the groups. Hundreds of alumni thanked Columbia's administration for suspending the anti-Israel groups accused of antisemitism.

Israel air force reveals note Hamas fighter allegedly carried during Oct 7 attack,2023-10-25,Fox News,['Greg Norman'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the war from southern Israel. 
The Israeli air force published a chilling, handwritten note Wednesday that it alleged was found on a Hamas fighter who invaded the country on Oct. 7. 
""The words from Hamas commanders,"" according to the Israeli air force, ""consist of an order to kill Jews and encouragement to decapitate their victims and tear out their hearts and livers. 
""Know that this enemy of yours is a disease that has no cure, other than beheading and extracting the hearts and livers!"" the Israeli military agency quoted the note as saying in a post on X. 
The emergence of the purported note comes days after Israel released what it described as ""gruesome"" and ""unseen"" bodycam footage of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack in order to counter a ""Holocaust denial-like phenomenon evolving in real time.""

The screening happened in Israel Monday morning. Some of the content, according to Fox News correspondent Mike Tobin, included Israelis being ambushed in their cars, a girl being executed after Hamas terrorists found her hiding under a desk and a father dying after a Hamas fighter threw a grenade into a bomb shelter that he and his two children were seeking cover in. 
Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy said in a video posted on X before the release that the Israel Defense Forces have ""been collecting footage from bodycams taken by the Hamas death squads,"" and that they would be making the footage public to maintain a record to counter those who doubt whether certain events took place.

"Sheryl Sandberg demands condemnation of rape of Jewish women by Hamas, says ‘politics are blinding us’",2023-12-04,Fox News,['Brooke Singman'],"Sheryl Sandberg spoke at an event hosted by Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations about the brutality of Hamas’ attacks and to ""expose the horrors and shocking acts of sexual violence committed"" against Jewish women on Oct. 7.
EXCLUSIVE: Sheryl Sandberg told Fox News Digital that ""politics are blinding us to something that is completely obvious""—condemning Hamas for rape and other sexual violence committed against Jewish women on Oct. 7.
Sandberg, the founder of ""Lean In"" and former chief operating officer of Facebook, spoke to Fox News Digital on the sidelines of an event hosted by Israel at the United Nations headquarters on Monday.
UNITED NATIONS SLAMMED FOR SILENCE OVER HAMAS RAPES, MUTILATION AND MURDER OF ISRAELI WOMEN, CRITICS SAY
The event, hosted by Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan, featured an address from Sandberg, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a video address by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and testimonials from Israeli police officers, and others about the brutality of Hamas’ attacks and to ""expose the horrors and shocking acts of sexual violence committed"" against women on Oct. 7.
Sheryl Sandberg spoke at an event hosted by Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations about the brutality of Hamas’ attacks and to ""expose the horrors and shocking acts of sexual violence committed"" against Jewish women on Oct. 7. 
""For a really long time, sexual violence was just a part of war, and we fought long and hard to get women listened to,"" Sandberg told Fox News Digital, pointing to the ""Me Too"" movement and more.
""And in this moment, politics are blinding us to something that is completely obvious—no matter what side of anything you are on,"" Sandberg told Fox News Digital. ""You need to be able to say that rape is unacceptable and sexual violence is unacceptable."" She added, ""If we don’t stand against this, we lose our humanity.""
Israeli officers on Monday shared their experiences in recovering women’s bodies after the massacre on Oct. 7, showing girls with broken pelvises; women and girls without clothing on covered in blood; women and girls’ bodies with shooting wounds targeted at sexual organs; breast amputations; naked women and girls’ in showers with their hands tied behind their backs; additional amputation of genitalia and more.
Sandberg and activists at the event at the United Nations called out women’s organizations for being silent on the issue—with Sandberg saying, ""Silence is complicity."" 
Gillibrand during the event said it makes her ""sick"" that women's groups have been ""silent."" 
""I think they’re not going to be quiet anymore,"" Sandberg told Fox News Digital after the event. ""I hope they’re not going to be quiet anymore.

""I call on everyone to speak out,"" Sandberg said, echoing her remarks during the event. ""And if the world isn’t listening to us, we’re just gonna have to speak louder.

""You always thought it could never happen here,"" she said.

Viral Israeli spokesman discusses ‘frustrating’ media narrative following deadly Oct. 7 terrorist attack,2023-12-04,Fox News,['Kendall Tietz'],"Eylon Levy detailed the difficult circumstances he has faced as a spokesperson for the Israeli government, especially in the weeks following the October 7 terror attack by Hamas. 
An Israeli government spokesman, who went viral for his reaction to a question he was asked about the value of Palestinian versus Israeli lives in the hostage swap with Hamas, spoke with Fox News Digital about the uphill battle Israel has faced from much of the media following the October 7 terrorist attack. 
During an interview on Sky News, interviewer Kay Burley suggested to Eylon Levy that because Israel would get back 50 hostages taken by Hamas last month in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners in the agreed-upon temporary cease-fire deal, it placed less value on Palestinian lives. 
""I was speaking to a hostage negotiator this morning,"" Burley said. ""He made the comparison between the 50 hostages that Hamas promised to release, as opposed to the 150 prisoners that are Palestinians that Israel has said that it will release.""
""And he made the comparison between the numbers and the fact that does Israel not think Palestinian lives are valued as highly as Israeli lives?"" she asked.
Levy raised his eyebrows in utter shock and told Burley that that was ""an astonishing accusation."" The video has since garnered over 16 million views since Levy shared it on social media. 
OUTRAGE AS UN-PALESTINIAN EXHIBITION USES MURDERED ISRAELI CHILD'S IMAGE AS A PALESTINIAN CIVILIAN CASUALTY
Levy said he was blown away by the public response to the clip after he shared it on social media, which he said demonstrated the way many people feel about how the media has covered the Israel-Hamas War.  (Eylon Levy)
""If we could release one prisoner for every one hostage, we would obviously do that,"" he added. ""We are operating in horrific circumstances.""
""Notice the question of proportionality doesn't interest Palestinian supporters when they are able to get more of their prisoners out,"" he said. ""It is outrageous to suggest that the fact that we are willing to release prisoners who are convicted of terrorism offenses, more of them than we are getting our own innocent children back, somehow suggests that we don't care about Palestinian lives? Really, that's a disgusting accusation.""
The Sky News reporter appeared unfazed by Levy's response and immediately pivoted to another question. 
Levy told Fox News Digital that the experience served as an example of the difficult circumstances faced by a spokesperson for the Israeli government, especially in the weeks following the October 7 terror attack by Hamas, which killed more than 1,200 people and was the single worst slaughter of Jewish people since the Holocaust.
After he shared the clip on social media, Levy said he was blown away by the public response, which he said demonstrated the moment clearly hit a nerve with many people about the way the media has covered the Israel-Hamas War. 
""A lot of people around the world and especially in Israel, where we suffer from this most, feel a deep sense of frustration with the way that the media covers this conflict, parts of the media, the way that sometimes the evidence of our humanity and our morality gets twisted and used against us,"" he explained. ""The sense that sometimes there's nothing we can do that will possibly be right and this was just such an absurd example.""
""This is really one of the most frustrating things of trying to be a spokesperson in a situation like this, which is where sometimes the good things we do, the evidence of our humanity, the evidence of our morality, gets completely twisted against us into something completely unrecognizable,"" he said. 
The viral video of Levy has since garnered over 16 million views.  (Haim Zach GPO)
""In this instance, we had a story of Israel's willingness to release violent criminals from jail in order to get our children back, in order to get women back from the captivity of the people who on October 7th burned, beheaded and raped people across southern Israel … [to] have that twisted against us, as if that means we undervalue human life is upsetting and frustrating,"" he added. 
JULIANNA MARGUILES SAYS NY TIMES ‘SAT’ ON HER OP-ED ABOUT ANTISEMITISM BEFORE GOING TO USA TODAY
Levy said he has faced similar situations with the media in recent weeks. In an interview with the BBC, he discussed Israel's plans to give Hamas ""the mother of all thumpings"" after it violated the terms of the hostage release pause and resumed rocket fire against Israel on December 1. 
""The first question I get from the BBC is that the ‘mother of all thumpings’ doesn't sound like it's consistent with a precise and targeted campaign against Hamas,"" he said. ""I have to reply, excuse me, I said, 'Hamas is going to get the mother of all thumpings because we're targeting Hamas.'""
""In the same press conference, I'm explaining the lengths that Israel is going to get civilians out of harm's way,"" he added. ""So sometimes when you say something very specific and have that twisted against you as evidence of the complete contrary, that can be very frustrating.""
While Levy said it isn't up to him to tell off the media and journalists who are trying to do their job, he said there is a huge range between the media who are still covering the atrocities of October 7th and who are telling the story of this war in the context of Israel having suffered the deadliest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and those in the media who are not. 
Levy explained that the Israel-Hamas war isn't another round of ""tit-for-tat"" or another round of violence (Haim Zach GPO)
""Therefore, we have no choice but to defend ourselves and the media that tries to downplay the context and present this as Israel continuing to attack Palestinians, seemingly for no reason, and that's very frustrating because there is a cause and there is an effect.""
""There is a cause: Hamas perpetrated the October 7th massacre and there is an effect: The Israeli military response,"" he added. ""Fighting has just resumed. There is a cause. Hamas decided not to release the women it had promised to release and to continue firing rockets at Israel. And there is an effect, the Israeli response.""
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN STUDENTS CONDEMN ‘DESPICABLE’ RESOLUTION ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE
He said that when the media twists the order of events and states Israel continues to attack Palestinian targets after Hamas fires a rocket or they ""hide"" somewhere at the bottom of an article that Hamas violated the terms of the pause that was already in existence, it serves as evidence of ""poor journalism.""
""Journalism is supposed to report the facts, not take sides [and] to understand the proper story and the proper context that everything is happening in,"" he said. ""It can be very frustrating when people have a story in their head, and they take the facts, and they simply fit the facts to try to fit the story that already makes sense in their head.""
""This isn't another round of tit-for-tat or another round of violence,"" he added. ""There is a context here, and you have to understand that context.""
""It can be very frustrating when people have a story in their head, and they take the facts, and they simply fit the facts to try to fit the story that already makes sense in their head,"" Eylon Levy told Fox News Digital.  (Haim Zach GPO)
While he believes the media should be fair and balanced in the way they cover things, Levy said this ""doesn't mean that in every story there are two equal sides.""

""Here you have on the one side children who are brutally abducted from their beds on October 7th while they were doing nothing more than sleeping in their beds and on the other side … they committed violent offenses, including attempted stabbings, attempted shootings, affiliations with terrorist organizations, offenses involving explosives … so to see people say, 'Oh, look, an Israeli family is happy to get its kids back, a Palestinian family is happy to get its kids back,' creates this false moral equivalence."" 
""October 7th was a moment of real moral clarity,"" he said. ""Are you on the side of humanity or on the side of savagery? On the side of civilization or the side of barbarism? Because that's what we are fighting against. We're fighting for humanity, for the most basic right of our children to sleep in their beds and not be abducted by masked terrorists … so when people somehow equate them and make them the same, that's outrageous.""

"Hamas, Hezbollah say Iran helped plan deadly attack on Israel: report",2023-10-08,Fox News,['Emma Colton'],"FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest details on Hamas' terror attacks on Israel on 'FOX News Live.'
Iran reportedly helped terrorist organization Hamas plan its surprise attack on Israel, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that Iranian security officials approved Hamas' plan to attack Israel during a meeting in Beirut last Monday. Hamas and Hezbollah leaders said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps worked with Hamas since August on air, land and sea attack plans. 
A European official who works as adviser to the Syrian government corroborated the Hamas and Hezbollah leaders' claims, according to the Wall Street Journal, though U.S. officials say they have not seen evidence of Iran's involvement in the attacks. 
""We have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind this particular attack, but there is certainly a long relationship,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CNN Sunday.

Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said Sunday that Iran is behind the attack. 
""We know that there were meetings in Syria and in Lebanon with other leaders of the terror armies that surround Israel so obviously it’s easy to understand that they tried to coordinate.

The Palestinian American Congress group, of which Tlaib is a member, has featured pro-Hamas posts in the wake of the deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
On Oct. 12, one group member posted: ""We don't want to throw you in the sea...we want you to ride it back from where you came."" The message was accompanied by a picture of an elderly Israeli woman and a Hamas fighter holding her captive.

""Since yesterday I have been attached to the TV watching the news,"" one group member posted on Oct. 10, addressing the ""American Media"" and saying, ""You, and the people directing you, are the problem, you created it almost 100 years ago, made it official 75 years ago and you have been feeding its flam ever since.""
""You consider Hamas a terrorist organization and I am not going to argue with you at the same time you have been broadcasting that they have been killing women and children, guess that is what terrorists do at the same time no mention to the killing of Palestinian women, children and entire families killed on a daily basses (sic) by the [peace-loving] state of Israel using American gifts of weapons and jet fighters.""
""Yesterday I didn't see Hamas I saw the grand kids (sic) of the refugees that ethnically cleansed from their homeland attacking the grand kids (sic) of the colonists whom sent them to diaspora,"" they later wrote.

Tlaib became a member of the group six years ago and posted in it during her 2018 congressional campaign. The following year, she came under fire after a report in the Daily Caller News Foundation revealed her membership and the slew of antisemitic posts in the group.

Tlaib is the only Palestinian American in Congress and has faced scrutiny over her comments after Hamas' bloody invasion and the ensuing war. In a largely symbolic gesture, the House of Representatives voted to censure her in a 234-188 vote last week as a formal public rebuke of her most recent anti-Israel comments made in the wake of the Jewish nation's battle against the terror group. Her congressional office did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
Tlaib has a long history with Abdel-qader, the founder of the Palestinian American Congress group, who has repeatedly promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories over the years. He previously shared a video that called Jews ""satanic"" and questioned whether 6 million of them had died in the Holocaust. He later walked back those comments.
OMAR, TLAIB DEMAND CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS CONDEMN 'ANTI-MUSLIM' AND 'ANTI-PALESTINIAN HATE'
Abdel-qader has participated in several fundraising events with Tlaib over the years and has also appeared in several pictures with her posted to social media accounts.
The Palestinian activist has not only been a key fundraiser for Tlaib, including personally donating at least $6,500 to her campaign since 2018, but he was also the chairman of her finance committee during her 2018 congressional campaign.
Tlaib introduced him by the title at a campaign event and presented him with a medal in April 2018 as a sign of gratitude for his help with her inaugural campaign.
On Monday, Abdel-qader posted a flier on his Facebook page, advertising a Chicago fundraiser for Tlaib and Pennsylvania Democrat Rep. Summer Lee, two congresswomen who he says ""whole heartedly (sic) support"" their community and the ""just cause of Palestine.""

Since Israel launched a counterattack against Hamas, Abdel-qader has attended pro-Palestinian protests in the United States and has posted anti-Israel messages on his Facebook page.
For example, on Oct. 19, Abdel-qader posted: ""Israeli Nazis air strike (sic) on Ahli Arab Hospital killed more than 500 people stop the massacre now.""
In reality, a failed rocket launch from the Palestinian side was responsible for hitting the hospital. Despite this, Tlaib and others repeated the falsehood that Israelis struck it, even after reports had shown that was not the case.

And in addition to Tlaib, Abdel-qader has also shown support for several other progressive politicians, including fellow ""Squad"" member Cori Bush of Missouri.
Bush took part in a virtual Zoom fundraiser with Abdel-qader in September 2021, per his since-locked Instagram account. In November of that year, Abdel-qader posted a Bush fundraising flier for a reception hosted by the St. Louis Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Muslim Community of St. Louis, which solicited donations between $100 and $2,500 for Bush's campaign. 
It appears he donated $250 to her campaign for the fundraiser.

The controversial activist has also campaigned with several other Democrats, including New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, among others.

No American hostages freed by Hamas on Day 1 of cease-fire,2023-11-24,Fox News,['Timothy H.J. Nerozzi'],"Video showed hostages released by Hamas arriving at the Rafah Crossing between Egypt and Gaza on Thursday, November 24, 2023. (Reuters)
Two dozen hostages were released by the terrorist group Hamas, but no American was released on the first day of the cease-fire with Israel.
Thirteen Israelis, plus 10 Thai citizens and one Filipino citizen, were released Friday into the care of Red Cross personnel, who were seen carrying those rescued via ambulance from Gaza into Egypt. 
The Israeli hostages were transported to Israel to receive care at various hospitals and are now accompanied by Israeli Defense Forces Special Forces.
A U.S. official told Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson that the U.S. is ""glad to see this process moving forward.""
""We are doing all we can, including to secure the release of Americans,"" the U.S. official said. ""We are focused on it hourly.""

Despite playing a key role in negotiating the cease-fire that has allowed the exchange of hostages, the U.S. has not seen any of its citizens currently held by Hamas freed.
According to U.S. intelligence, approximately 10 Americans are being held hostage by the terrorist group.
Israel and Hamas have agreed to a four-day cease-fire during which the terrorist group will release 50 women and children taken in the October 7 attack on Israel in exchange for 150 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

Israeli leaders have vowed to resume the war once the cease-fire lifts.
""Israel will continue its war on Hamas, and we will not stop until we achieve our two main goals, overthrowing the rule of Hamas and returning all the abductees back to us, safe and sound,"" Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said Friday as he toured Israel’s ravaged border areas with his counterparts from Portugal and Slovenia.

Gaza hospital blast: Here’s what we know,2023-10-18,Fox News,"['Greg Wehner', 'Michael Tobin', 'Trey Yingst']","Keshet 12 News anchor Yonit Levi describes the moment a news camera captures a rocket launched from Gaza hitting the al-Ahli Hospital. (Keshet News 12.)
The al-Ahali Hospital in Gaza City was struck Tuesday night, and hundreds were reportedly killed in the blast. Hamas initially claimed the hospital was attacked in an Israeli strike; Israel countered after an investigation that it was hit by an errant missile launched by terrorists in Gaza itself. 
Online video making the rounds on social media suggests the al-Ahali Hospital in Gaza City was not directly hit by a rocket on Tuesday, but instead the missile appears to have struck a nearby parking lot, leading to many conflicting claims of who was responsible, where the missile struck and how many people died.
Hamas was targeting Tel Aviv with rocket fire on Tuesday, and has been targeting central Israel multiple times each day.

Shortly after the blast, senior Hamas officials told Fox, ""After the barbaric attack, it's too early to talk about this.""
After an investigation, Israel said on Tuesday the rocket was fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a State Department designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran.
""An analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the al-Ahli [Baptist] hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,"" IDF officials said. ""Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza.""

While Israel rebutted the claims immediately, President Biden, who was in Israel on Wednesday, stated intelligence from the Pentagon supports Israel’s assertion that the blast originated from rocket fire in Gaza.
Biden reiterated his belief that Israel was not to blame later on Wednesday. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson also reaffirmed the U.S. position.
""While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,"" she wrote.

Israeli media showed footage from their own cameras that appears to show at least one rocket fired by Palestinians in Gaza falling short and landing on a hospital in their own territory.
Shared by Keshet 12 News, the footage clearly shows multiple rockets launching toward Israel on Tuesday. Moments later, a blast is seen in Gaza midway along the rockets' trajectory.

When compared to images of typical Israeli missile strikes that show craters after the explosion, the parking lot had a small indentation, showing a different type of missile may have been responsible for the blast.
While the rocket appears to have struck a parking lot, the Hamas-run hospital treating wounded Palestinians and sheltering many others was certainly damaged, but not destroyed.
Another conflict point centers around the number of deaths from the blast.

The blast in the parking lot was enough to damage the hospital, but according to sources at the scene, it was not enough to destroy the facility, calling the reported number of deaths into question.
The Gaza Health Ministry initially reported that at least 500 people were killed at al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, and Hamas said it was the result of an Israel airstrike.
At this time, the number of people killed in the blast is unconfirmed, though Reuters quoted the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry saying there were 471 people dead as of 3 p.m. on Wednesday.

michigan,2023-11-29,Fox News,['Kyle Morris'],"Rep. Virginia Foxx said college administrators need to be held accountable for spikes in antisemitism on college campuses. 
Jewish students at the University of Michigan are expressing concern over a referendum campaign orchestrated by their peers that accuses Israel of genocide amid the war-torn country's war with Hamas.
From Nov. 28 to 30, students at the University of Michigan are being given the opportunity to vote on two separate ballot measures – Assembly Resolution 13-025 (AR 13-025), which calls for the university to ""investigate their investments in any apartheid regime"" while recognizing ""the millions of people undergoing genocide in Gaza as we speak,"" and Assembly Resolution 13-026 (AR 13-026), which criticizes Hamas while condemning ""the rise in Islamophobia, Antisemitism, and other forms of hate speech"" amid the war.
Earlier this month, the Central Student Government at the university voted down (AR 13-025), the anti-Israel measure, when it was presented as a petition at the Assembly’s Oct. 31 meeting, according to The Michigan Review, one of the school's newspapers. The CSG's decision – with six voting in favor of the resolution, 21 voting against it, and three abstaining – sent the resolution to the student body for a vote.

Similarly, the CSG also rejected AR 13-026, which was offered in opposition to AR 13-025 at the time. A vote on AR 13-026 by the CSG – with five people voting in favor of it, 23 voting against it, and two abstaining – also resulted in the resolution being sent to the student body for a vote.
The CSG did, however, pass Assembly Resolution 13-024, which denounces ""an ongoing climate of fear, as well as a culture of harassment and viewpoint discrimination"" on campus as a result of the war.
Explaining the CSG's votes, Patrick Szendro-Arceo, a representative for the governing body of the school, told The Michigan Review that the ""issue is beyond us as representatives.""
""This [issue] is more to be decided by the actual students than by the representatives, who do not have the degree of knowledge or certainty on what is best to decide, so we decided to leave it up to the students. Student Government will not take a stance on which group we prefer over the other,"" Szendro-Arceo told the outlet.
AR 13-025 came in response to remarks offered in October by University of Michigan President Santa J. Ono, who decried ""the horrific attack by Hamas terrorists on Israeli citizens"" and asked students to ""be conscious, kind and compassionate to their peers during this difficult time.""
""This statement failed to address the developing situation in Gaza and the retaliatory offenses committed by Israel on innocent Palestinian lives. Furthermore, the University’s initial statement on this issue failed to mention the word 'Palestine' or ‘Gaza,’ causing entire student populations to feel unseen and theorized,"" AR 13-025 states.
The resolution ""requests the university to speak against apartheid regimes and speak for all people suffering violence and oppression across the world regardless of conflicts of interests held by the university and its endowment.""
Largely pushed by Students Aligned for Freedom and Equality (SAFE), an anti-Israel group described online as ""a Palestinian solidarity organization and the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter at the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,"" AR 13-025 also calls for the university to ""recognize the millions of people undergoing genocide in Gaza as we speak"" and ""put into action the very ideals it proudly teaches by loudly and clearly rewriting historically colonist-centered narratives about war, genocide, terrorism, and apartheid.""

Following Hamas terrorists' Oct. 7 invasion and massacre in southern Israel, SAFE shared a series of posts to Instagram. One post made on the same day Hamas invaded Israel was captioned, ""The Palestinian people have endured a brutal military occupation for decades. Tens of thousand[s] of lives have been taken away at the hands of Zionist colonial entity, Israel. Millions have been made refugees and millions more suffer under the apartheid regime. Palestinians have the right to defend themselves from their oppressors. To think otherwise is to declare that Palestinians are not human enough and worthy enough to live in dignity.""
""If you are only concerned about the reaction of the oppressed, rather than the cause of the oppression, you have taken the side of the inhumane,"" the caption added. ""Free Palestine. Long live the resistance towards freedom and collective liberation.""
The image shared by SAFE in the post, which appeared to include pro-Hamas language, declared that the ""unprecedented and ongoing resistance by Palestinians from Gaza, that caught Israel by surprise, did not happen in a vacuum. This is the response of a people pushed beyond endurance.""
Another post by the group, shared on Oct. 8, advertised a pro-Palestine rally in Detroit and claimed the ""resistance’s offensive attack has shaped a new precedent for our national liberation struggle and we remain steadfast in our right to resist imperialism in all its forms.""
""ALL OUT FOR PALESTINE,"" the advertisement, which included SAFE's logo, stated.
The referendum campaign has left some students at the university feeling uneasy and led several pro-Israel students at the school to launch a ""Vote No"" campaign through Facts on the Ground (FOG), a group described online as a coalition of ""students on campus working to ‘clear the fog’ of disinformation being spread in the wake of the October 7, 2023, attack and ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.""
""The AR 13-025 resolution being voted on by 50,000 plus students is despicable. AR 25 contains factually inaccurate language urging the university president and board of regents to condemn Israel as a settler colonialist apartheid regime that commits genocide,"" Anna Raab, a junior at the University of Michigan, told Fox News Digital. ""Those claims are factually inaccurate and historically false.""

Urging her peers to vote no on the resolution, Raab said AR 13-025 ""sends a message that not all students are welcomed on this campus"" and ""targets Jewish and Israeli students by delegitimizing their right to exist and telling them that the antisemitism they experience is accepted on this campus.""
EDITOR OF COLLEGE PAPER WHO QUIT AFTER ANTI-ISRAEL OUTCRY WARNS ISSUE NOT JUST AT ELITE SCHOOLS
Raab also recalled how she was verbally assaulted on campus and called a ""terrorist"" by a pro-Palestinian protester, adding that she is ""scared if AR 25 passes that the hatred that has pervaded our campus will continue to spread, threatening the safety of so many students.""
""I quickly realized she noticed the Hebrew letters on my necklace – a necklace I wear proudly for my grandmother, a Holocaust survivor who is still with us today at 98 years old,"" Raab recalled of the assault. ""My grandmother has warned me that the rhetoric being spread on campus and in AR 25 is eerily similar to the propaganda spread in Europe in the 1930s.""
Rachel Cusnir, another junior at the university, also expressed worry over the resolution, telling Fox that it is ""extremely disheartening for University of Michigan students to vote on such inflammatory and false information.""
""This referendum is trying to convince students that Israel is committing genocide and ethnic cleansing,"" she said. ""Not only is that a blatant lie, but the ballot measure does not acknowledge the massacre that Hamas committed against innocent Israeli civilians on Oct. 7. The current war against Hamas is a necessary response and legitimate self-defense, and this petition fails to acknowledge that.""
""If this petition passes, Jewish students will have a target on their backs solely for being Jewish and supporting the only Jewish state in the world,"" Cusnir added.
Rep. Kathy Manning, D-N.C., has spoken out against AR 13-025, saying she is ""deeply disappointed that this divisive referendum has been put to a vote"" while calling on students to ""send a strong message against antisemitism.""
""I strongly condemn the referendum before the University of Michigan student body this week that refers to Israel as an 'apartheid state' and ‘settler colonialism’ while holding Israel solely responsible for the terrorist acts committed by Hamas on October 7, which killed 1,400 innocent civilians and saw 240 people taken hostage,"" Manning said in a statement. ""It is also troubling that this referendum was introduced in response to President Ono's condemnation of the terrorism committed by Hamas. Denouncing terrorism should not be controversial.""
""Since October 7, antisemitism has skyrocketed, threatening students on college campuses. I call upon campus administrators to ensure the safety and security of all students, added Manning, a graduate of the University of Michigan.
As outlined in the University of Michigan Student Constitution, ""If a simple majority of voting students vote to approve the legislation, it is adopted."" If a ballot question is adopted, ""the Assembly must not legislate contrary to valid vote [sic] of the student body until the seating of a new Assembly,"" which will take place after the election in March 2024.
A vote by students on both resolutions comes nearly two weeks after pro-Palestinian protesters on the University of Michigan's campus forced their way into the Ruthven Administration Building, which houses Ono's office. A spokesperson for the university confirmed at the time that protesters remained in the building well into the evening as police attempted to control the scene.

Other opposition to Israel's efforts in the war were met with backlash from more than 1,000 professors and graduate students at the University of Michigan who signed on to a statement in October that claimed there is a ""campaign of destruction being undertaken by the Israeli military against the entire civilian population in Gaza.""
The University of Michigan did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Enes Kanter Freedom questions Palestinian supporters amid Israeli conflict: ‘Your hypocrisy is killing me’,2023-11-03,Fox News,['Joe Morgan'],"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
As the conflict between Israel and Hamas approaches the end of its fourth week, support for Palestinians has been seen across the world.
Marches and rallies have been held in support of Palestine, with calls for a ceasefire, as Israel has continued to respond after the October 7 attacks that saw Hamas indiscriminately kill civilians while taking others' hostage.

""Where were you when ISIS was launched in the name of ‘Islam’, and beheaded tens of thousands of Arabs in Libya, Syria and Iraq?"" Kanter Freedom asked. ""Why didn’t you take it to the streets, raise their flags, condemn the terror or call for a ceasefire? Where were you in the last decade when Arab countries killed and starved out more than 400,000 Yemenis? I didn’t see any of you take it to the streets, raise the Yemeni flag, condemn the terror or call for a ceasefire? When millions of Arabs are slaughtered by other Arabs, you say absolutely nothing?""

""I’m a proud Muslim, and I stand with my Muslim brothers and sisters around the world,"" the post added. ""I’m praying for innocent people in Palestine everyday but your hypocrisy is killing me!!""
Kanter Freedom has long advocated for human rights around the world, turning his attention toward China in October 2021 while calling the leader of the Chinese Communist Party a ""brutal dictator"" as he advocated for an independent Tibet. 
Kanter Freedom would continue his campaign throughout the first few months of the 2021-22 NBA season, calling out Nike, the NBA and superstar LeBron James for turning a blind eye toward China's human rights abuses. 
On the day that Hamas attacked Israel, Kanter Freedom strongly condemned the attack while expressing solidarity with the victims and their families. 
""I’ve been closely monitoring what’s going on in the Middle East,"" Kanter Freedom said in part to Fox News Digital. ""I’ve come across numerous messages, and I believe that it’s very important to address the situation in Israel with clarity. What is happening there is undeniably barbaric, acts of terrorism that cannot be softened with ‘buts’ or additional justifications.

""The loss of innocent lives can never be justified by any means. It’s crucial to emphasize that these events have nothing to do with Islam. In fact, Islam teaches that taking the life of one innocent person is equal to killing entire humanity. We have to condemn these actions and stand in solidarity with the innocent people in Israel. Many of my Palestinian friends are not supporting Hamas, each act of Hamas terrorism; taking away hopes for peace in the region."" 
Kanter Freedom has not played in the NBA since being waived by the Houston Rockets in February 2022 and told Fox News Digital in April that no team had reached out to him or his agent to inquire about his services.

"Hamas terror base is hidden beneath Gaza’s largest hospital, Israel alleges",2023-10-27,Fox News,"['Timothy H.J. Nerozzi', 'Chris Pandolfo']","IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the biggest hospital in Gaza, is a shield for Hamas' underground terror network. (Israeli Defense Forces)
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) is alleging the discovery of a Hamas military base under their largest hospital.
The IDF has released images and accompanying graphics claiming an extensive command post exists under Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza.
""Hamas terrorists operate inside and under Shifa hospital — and other hospitals in Gaza — with a network of terror tunnels,"" said IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. ""Shifa is not the only hospital — it is one of many. Hamas-use of hospitals is systematic.""

The Al-Shifa Hospital is the largest medical care facility in Gaza, with 1,500 beds and over 4,000 staff members.
""We have concrete evidence that hundreds of terrorists flooded into the hospital to hide there after the massacres of October 7,"" he added.
A senior Hamas leader called the allegations ""baseless"" in a statement reported by the Times of Israel.
Izzat al-Rishq said that ""these lies represent a prelude to a new massacre against our people, greater than the one of the al-Ahli Baptist Hospital"" — referring to the Oct. 17 blast that U.S. intelligence determined was likely caused by an Islamic Jihad rocket misfiring. Hamas has blamed Israel for the explosion and accused the Jewish state of committing war crimes against the Palestinian people.
""Over 40,000 have sought refuge in Al-Shifa hospital, as they were displaced by the bombing that hit everything,"" al-Rishq said. ""We call on the leaders of Arab and Muslim countries to take action and stop the genocide against our people.""
Israel has long voiced outrage at Palestinian militants' strategic placement of military infrastructure within hospital complexes.

It is not uncommon for Hamas militants to intentionally embed military infrastructure into civilian spaces in order to make targeted strikes collaterally damaging.
The number of hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists has risen to 229, IDF spokesperson Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari said Friday afternoon.

The IDF said Friday that an airstrike killed Madhath Mubashar, the commander of Hamas' Western Khan Yunis battalion.
Mubashar is accused of taking part in explosives and sniper attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilian communities.
""Furthermore, the IDF struck 250+ Hamas targets including a terrorist tunnel network in Gaza that detonated the secondary explosions,"" the IDF said.

Kirby: ‘No question’ that Hamas hostage seen in video was speaking ‘under duress’,2023-10-17,Fox News,['Greg Norman'],"FOX News' Mike Tobin speaks with Keren Schem, who is demanding the return of her daughter.
White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Tuesday that there is ""no question"" in his mind that a female hostage who appeared in a video released by Hamas was making statements ""under duress.""
Kirby made the remark on NBC’s ""Today"" show after the Palestinian terrorist group shared footage Monday of Mia Schem, a 21-year-old French Israeli, who, according to Reuters, asked to be returned to her family as soon as possible. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for Schem’s immediate release.
""There is no question in my mind that that woman gave that video testimony under duress, probably forced to do it,"" Kirby said. ""It’s a propaganda video much more than it is proof of life or certainly proof of concept for Hamas. It’s despicable, deplorable that they would take these hostages and then advertise how well they are treating them when they are the ones who hurt them in the first place.""
Kirby reiterated a call for Hamas to immediately release all of its hostages, estimated to include 199 Israelis and other foreign nationals.

""We know there is a small number of Americans, but all of them need to come home and be with their families,"" he said.
Kirby also said Israel is a ""dynamic area – in many ways, a combat zone"" as President Biden is preparing to travel there Wednesday.
""The president is well aware of that,"" Kirby told NBC. ""Obviously, we will take all the appropriate security precautions to make sure he can conduct this trip safely and effectively.""

Hamas terrorists launched an unprecedented invasion into Israel on Oct. 7, slaughtering more than 1,400 Israelis, including at least 260 attendees of the Tribe of Nova Trance music festival.
Schem attended the festival and was among those taken captive.
Mia’s mother, Keren Schem, said she was living her ""worst nightmare"" after learning her daughter was taken hostage by Hamas.
""I didn't know if she was dead or alive,"" she told Fox News' Mike Tobin. ""I knew nothing until yesterday when I saw this video.""
During a press conference Tuesday, Schem called for her daughter’s safe return.

Climate activist Greta Thunberg posted then deleted a pro-Palestinian post on X following some backlash.
Early Friday morning, the 20-year-old Swedish activist posted a since-deleted photo of herself and three other activists with signs that read, ""Free Palestine,"" ""Climate Justice Now,"" ""This Jew Stands With Palestine"" and ""Stand With Gaza.""

At least five Americans were among the group of civilians who fled Gaza for Egypt on Wednesday, U.S. officials say.
All five U.S. citizens – who are the only known Americans to leave Gaza today – were aid workers. The U.S. State Department says that it will give instructions to the 400 other Americans who expressed a desire to leave, along with their families. The total number is around 1,000 people.
""Due to privacy considerations we are not offering further details about the individuals who were able to depart,"" a spokesperson told Fox News. ""We continue to work towards safe passage for more U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and family members in the coming days.""
Fox News learned that the evacuation was conducted with the help of the Special Operations Association of America, who rescued at least 25 other aid workers.

College campus protests erupt across US ahead of anticipated Israel operation in Gaza,2023-10-13,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"The New York City Police Department took a pro-Palestinian protester into custody during a protest at Baruch College on Friday. (Credit: Peter Gerber)
College campuses have erupted in shows of support with protests on Thursday and Friday for the Palestinian people following the Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel last week. 
At least 2,800 people have died since Hamas launched thousands of rockets on Israel over the weekend, pushing Israel to declare it was at war with the terrorist group and issue warnings to residents in Gaza ahead of operations in the territory to root out the group.
Former Hamas leader Khaled Mashal labeled Friday a global day of ""rage"" and protest, which resulted in protests in Arab nations throughout the region. Mashal stressed that the protests would send a ""message of rage to Zionists and to America."" 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Fox News' Trey Yingst that their infantry forces and tanks entered the Gaza Strip on Friday to conduct localized raids - but not yet begun its much-anticipated ground invasion of the region. 
The protests, not limited to campuses in the cases of some New York City colleges such as Baruch College on the city’s Upper East Side, took aim at Israel for its treatment of the Palestinian people over the past decades and Israel’s apparent response.

An Israeli-born restaurant owner in Philadelphia was harassed by a large group of pro-Palestinian protesters who gathered outside his store Sunday night and accused him of genocide.
Hundreds of protesters marched through Philadelphia calling for a cease-fire in Gaza when some of the demonstrators stormed Goldie, an Israeli-style falafel shop co-owned by chef Michael Solomonov. The protesters shouted outside the restaurant and vandalized it, officials said.
Their actions were captured on video and shared by the state’s governor, prompting criticism from other officials.
""Goldie, Goldie you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide,"" the protesters can be heard shouting in the video.

Israel’s military says force is ‘at war’ with Hamas as IDF hits back at terror targets,2023-10-07,Fox News,"['Peter Aitken', 'Chris Pandolfo']","FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on the 'unprecedented' air, ground and sea terror assault on Israel by Hamas on 'The Big Weekend Show.'
Israel’s military forces have opened up fighting in nearly two dozen locations along the Gaza border after Hamas terrorists launched thousands of rockets into Israel Saturday morning. 
""There is no community in Southern Israel where we do not have forces in all the towns,"" Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a statement Saturday evening. ""There are communities that have been rid of terrorists, but we want to finish additional scans of the area before declaring so.""
Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists invaded areas of southern Israel as rocket barrages launched from the Gaza Strip struck the area Saturday, killing at least 300 Israelis and wounding at least 1500 others, according to Fox News.
A senior Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif, announced the start of the operation, calling on Palestinians everywhere to attack the Israelis, saying in a broadcast on Hamas media that the group launched thousands of rockets and calling the attack ""the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth.""

Reports on the number of rockets have ranged from 2,100 to 5,000, the former reported by the IDF, the latter claimed by Deif in his initial announcement.
Following a meeting of the Israeli government's security cabinet on Saturday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated, ""We are embarking on a long and difficult war that was forced on us by a murderous Hamas attack. The first stage is ending at this time by the destruction of the vast majority of the enemy forces that infiltrated our territory. At the same time, we have begun the offensive phase, which will continue with neither limitations nor respite until the objectives are achieved.We will restore security to the citizens of Israel and we will win.""
The IDF claimed to have blocked many of the rockets with the country’s robust missile defense system, Iron Dome. A retaliatory strike on Hamas targets has resulted in at least 198 Palestinians killed, according to Gaza health officials. 
In a video message early Saturday morning, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ""Citizens of Israel, we are at war — not in an operation, not in rounds — at war.""

""Dozens of terrorists infiltrated on foot a large number of locations,"" Hagari explained. ""There was also a naval infiltration bringing the terrorists to Zikim. There are also a large number of breaches in the security fence.""
The IDF said it aims to kill all the Hamas agents who attacked Israel today, and Hagari urged Israeli residents to shelter in place until the threat has been cleared. U.S. Embassy staff in Israel are also sheltering in place.

31 premature babies evacuated from Gaza’s largest hospital as US confirms Hamas operations there,2023-11-20,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the IDF's efforts from southern Israel. 
More than 30 premature babies in ""extremely critical condition"" were evacuated from Gaza’s main hospital on Sunday, health officials said.
A World Health Organization-led team said the babies had been safely removed from the Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, where power was cut and clean water, fuel, medical supplies, food and other essential items had ran out. They are now receiving urgent care in the southern Gaza city of Rafah and will ultimately be transferred to Egypt.
""The babies were successfully transported to the neonatal intensive care unit at Al-Helal Al-Emarati Maternity Hospital in southern Gaza, where they are being assessed and stabilized,"" the WHO said. ""Doctors there say all the babies are fighting serious infections due to lack of medical supplies and impossibility to continue infection control measures in Al-Shifa Hospital.

Many had dehydration, hypothermia and sepsis in some cases, said Mohamed Zaqout, director of Gaza hospitals. At least two babies died in the days before the facility was evacuated, the WHO said.

The WHO-led joint U.N. mission worked in collaboration with the Palestine Red Crescent Society to transport the severely ill babies in six ambulances. Other members of the high-risk rescue mission included U.N. Mine Action, UNICEF and UNRWA. The rescue happened as there was active combat between Israeli and Hamas forces near the hospital.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered the hospital to look for Hamas operatives, who they have said used the hospital to store weapons. The IDF also said Hamas operated underground below the hospital.
Later Sunday, Israel’s army said it had strong evidence supporting its claims that Hamas maintains a sprawling command post inside and under the Shifa hospital. Israel has portrayed the hospital as a key target in its war to end Hamas’ rule in Gaza following the militant group’s into southern Israel six weeks ago.

The army said it found a 55-meter (60-yard) tunnel about 10 meters (33 feet) under the hospital’s 20-acre complex, which includes several buildings, garages and a plaza. It said the tunnel included a staircase and a firing hole that could be used by snipers and ended at a blast-proof door that troops have not yet opened.

""I can confirm for you that we have information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad used some hospitals in the Gaza strip, including Al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them to conceal and support their military operations and to hold hostages,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last week.
The plight of the babies, along with the Israeli claims against Shifa Hospital, have become potent symbols in the devastating war between Israel and Hamas and the tremendous civilian toll as thousands of Palestinians and Israelis have been caught in the crossfire.
The WHO said none of the babies had accompanying family members and the Ministry of Health was not able to find close family members.

The WHO, UNICEF, UNMAS, UNRWA and the other involved organizations who helped rescue the babies said over 250 patients and 20 health workers remain at Al-Shifa, and are all requesting immediate evacuation.
""Planning is ongoing to evacuate the remaining patients, their families and the health-care workers. Given the complex security and logistics constraints, these evacuations will take several days to complete. Priority will be given to the 22 dialysis patients and 50 patients with spinal injuries. WHO reaffirms its respect for the dedication, professionalism, humanity and courage of the health staff who have continued to care for their patients under unimaginably difficult conditions,"" the WHO said.
NSC LEADER CLAIMS US ‘CLOSER’ THAN EVER TO HOSTAGE DEAL DESPITE ONGOING HAMAS STANDOFF
About 1,200 people have been killed on the Israeli side, mainly civilians, during the Oct. 7 attack in which Hamas dragged some 240 captives back into Gaza and shattered Israel’s sense of security. The military says 63 Israeli soldiers have been killed, including 12 over the past 24 hours.

More than 11,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to Hamas-run Palestinian health authorities. Another 2,700 have been reported missing, including those believed buried in rubble. The count does not differentiate between Palestinian civilians and Hamas terrorists.

UN account hit for explicitly condemning Hamas’ attack on Israel eight weeks later: 'Took you long enough,2023-12-02,Fox News,['Gabriel Hays'],"IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner discusses the resumption of fighting in Gaza and Israel's goals to defeat Hamas. 
The official UN Women X account took serious heat this week after explicitly condemning the Hamas massacre in Israel for the first time, nearly two months after the attack happened. 
The delayed condemnation prompted criticism from social media users, and even U.S. lawmakers, who – prior to UN Women’s long-awaited statement – signed a letter rebuking the group for its silence.
The group, an arm of the United Nations promoting gender equality and women’s rights throughout the world, finally condemned Hamas explicitly in an X post on Friday. 
JULIANNA MARGULIES: COLLEGE KIDS WITH ‘THEY/THEM’ PRONOUNS SUPPORTTING HAMAS WOULD BE ‘BEHEADED’ IN GAZA
The official X account for a United Nations womens group got hammered this week after waiting almost two months to call out Hamas by name for its attack on Israel. (REUTERS/Yana Paskova/File Photo)
In an X thread that began with UN Women’s statement, ""We reiterate that all women, Israeli women, Palestinian women, as all others, are entitled to a life lived in safety and free from violence."" The group wrote, ""We unequivocally condemn the brutal attacks by Hamas on Israel on 7 October. We are alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks.""
Again, this was nearly two entire months since the attack on Israel by the terror group. Until this post, there were a couple that came close to a condemnation of Hamas, one of which didn’t even belong to the group.
On Oct. 14, the account posted, ""UN Women condemns the attacks on civilians in Israel & the Occupied Palestinian Territories, & is deeply alarmed by the devastating impact on civilians including women & girls. International Humanitarian Law & Human Rights Law must be respected & upheld.""
There was no mention of Hamas, and the only post that UN Women made about the attack on the day it happened was a repost of Executive Director of UN Women Sima Bahous’ statement, which read, ""The escalation of hostilities in #Israel & the Occupied Palestinian Territory #OPT is gravely concerning. It is imperative that all civilians, including women & girls, are protected.
She added, ""We call for immediate deescalation & for upholding & respecting international humanitarian law.""
And on Nov. 29, still almost two months removed from Hamas’ attack, UN Women reposted a statement from UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who said, ""There are numerous accounts of sexual violence during the abhorrent acts of terror by Hamas on 7 October that must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted. Gender-based violence must be condemned. Anytime. Anywhere.""
However, the account consistently posted about the plight of Gazans more than 25 times throughout the two months since the attack.
One of these posts claimed, ""#Gaza spent the night in darkness and fear. The collapse of the humanitarian system is imminent. We continue to call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and humanitarian access to food, water, medicine and fuel.We also call for the unconditional release of all hostages.""
Another mentioned Israel’s death toll next to Gaza’s but provided little context around any of the deaths: ""In Israel 1,400 people have been killed and over 200 have been taken hostage. In #Gaza over 9,700 people have been killed. We continue to call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and unconditional release of hostages.""
The United States Congress noticed the silence on Hamas from UN Women, with members publishing a bipartisan letter led by Young Kim (R-Calif.) and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Fla.), blasting the group and Bahous for displaying a ""one-sided approach"" to the issue. 
The letter stated, ""The failure by UN Women to publicly stand up for Israeli women and condemn Hamas’ systematic atrocities undermines UN Women and highlights its one-sided approach.""
""Your disregard and tone-deaf response to Hamas’ attack is woefully unsatisfactory and consistent with the UN’s longstanding bias against Israel,"" it added.
SUSAN SARANDON APOLOGIZES FOR ‘TERRIBLE MISTAKE’ OF MAKING ANTI-JEWISH COMMENTS AT RALLY
The ""UN Women"" account's recent posting history suggested it was more sympathetic to the plight of Gazans than the 1400 people in Israel during the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)
Earlier this week, CNN pressed UN Women Deputy Director Sarah Hendriks about her group’s failure to ""specifically call out Hamas."" The official’s answer still managed to sidestep any mention of Hamas but noted the UN is supportive of ""impartial, independent investigation"" into the attacks. 
Once the group gave its explicit condemnation of Hamas on Dec. 1, X users were not satisfied.
Jewish comms person and journalist Eitan Fischberger ripped the post, stating, ""What kind of ‘gender-based atrocities and sexual violence,’ @UN_Women? Be specific. This is your first post to mention Hamas since 2013, and you fail to explicitly call out its mass rapes. Too late, too late.""
Political commentator David Weissman replied, ""Took you long enough.""
HuffPost journalist Yashar Ali commented, ""Almost two months later.""
GB News commentator Darren Grimes added, ""You took your bloody time?!""
CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins stated, ""Nearly two months later.""
The Independent Women’s Forum’s Gabriella Hoffman rebuked UN Women, stating, ""This should have been tweeted on October 7th. Embarrassing, but par for the course for any and all UN entities.""

Celebrities have a whole lot to say about the war between Israel and Hamas.
Unfortunately, some of it is offensive. Unfortunately, some of it is flat wrong. Unfortunately, some of it is just plain dumb.
Maybe they should think twice before spouting off.
It goes without saying that they have every right to share their opinions, even misinformed opinions. Some are activists who have championed certain issues for years. Others are dilettantes just looking for a little online applause. 
DEMS UNLEASH ON LEFTIST JAYAPAL AFTER DOWNPLAYING TERRORISTS RAPING WOMEN
Jewish Actress Julianna Margulies said ""the fact that the entire Black community isn’t standing with us, to me, says either they just don’t know or they’ve been brainwashed to hate Jews."" (Gilbert Flores/Variety/Penske Media via Getty Images)
It’s up to the public — including their fans — to discern the difference. 
Julianna Margulies, the Emmy Award-winning actress, was speaking on a podcast when she went way over the top.
The star of ""The Good Wife,"" who is Jewish, said ""the fact that the entire Black community isn’t standing with us, to me, says either they just don’t know or they’ve been brainwashed to hate Jews."" 
Brainwashed?

She also said that gays ""will be the first people beheaded and their heads played like a soccer ball on the field"" in areas run by Hamas and other Islamic regimes.
Oh, and as someone ""who plays a lesbian journalist on ‘The Morning Show.’ I am more offended by it as a lesbian than I am as a Jew, to be honest with you.""
The backlash was immediate.

And the apology came quickly.
""I am horrified by the fact that statements I made on a recent podcast offended the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities, communities I truly love and respect. I want to be 100% clear: Racism, homophobia, sexism, or any prejudice against anyone’s personal beliefs or identity are abhorrent to me, full stop."" 
She added: ""Throughout my career I have worked tirelessly to combat hate of all kind, end antisemitism, speak out against terrorist groups like Hamas, and forge a united front against discrimination. I did not intend for my words to sow further division, for which I am sincerely apologetic.""
Now that is a full-throated apology. Not one of those wimpy, ""I regret if anyone chooses to be offended."" 
I like Margulies’ work, but this was a self-inflicted wound.
Last month, Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon also went too far.
She declared at a pro-Palestinian rally that those who now fear being Jewish are ""getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.""
Though the fallout was swift and United Talent Agency immediately dropped her as a client, two weeks went by before Sarandon felt the need to backtrack.

""This phrasing was a terrible mistake,"" she said, ""as it implies that until recently Jews have been strangers to persecution, when the opposite is true.""
Sarandon added: ""As we all know, from centuries of oppression and genocide in Europe, to the Tree of Life shooting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania … I deeply regret diminishing this reality and hurting people with this comment. It was my intent to show solidarity in the struggle against bigotry of all kinds, and I am sorry I failed to do so.""
This, too, seems like a heartfelt apology. But I have to ask: What took her so long? Was she worried about further damage to her career?

The Hollywood elite versus Trump is an old storyline, dating back to a slam by Meryl Streep at the beginning of his presidency.

"The most extreme anti-Israel, Hamas-sympathizing moments on college campuses since the Oct. 7 attacks",2023-10-30,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"Meir Hecht, the rabbi of two American hostages freed by Hamas, discusses antisemitism on college campuses and why this demonstrates ‘moral depravity’
Since the Oct. 7 attacks committed against Israel by Hamas, there has been an outpouring of protests across the world not condemning the terror group but rather the Jewish State, which is still reeling from the murder of over 1,400 Israelis. 
But perhaps the most extreme displays from the Hamas-sympathizing supporters are coming from American college campuses. 
Here are some examples of the jarring actions and rhetoric coming from both students and professors alike.
More than 30 student groups at Harvard co-signed a letter declaring they ""hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.""
""Today’s events did not occur in a vacuum,"" the letter read. ""For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison. Israeli officials promise to ‘open the gates of hell,’ and the massacres in Gaza have already commenced. In the coming days, Palestinians will be forced to bear the full brunt of Israel’s violence. The apartheid regime is the only one to blame.""
HARVARD STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS CLAIM ISRAEL ‘ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE’ FOR GAZA ATTACKS
At least five of the groups withdrew their support for the letter following intense backlash. Harvard president Claudine Gay also addressed the controversy insisting the university ""reject terrorism"" and denounce hate and harassment towards any group but maintained support for free expression on campus. 
New York University students were caught tearing down posters of Israeli hostages Oct. 16 outside the university's Tisch Hall.
Yazmeen Deyhimi, one of the three students identified in the viral video, offered an apology on social media.

NYU STUDENT ADMITS TEARING DOWN ISRAELI HOSTAGE POSTERS, BLAMES ‘MISPLACED ANGER’
""My actions that were caught on camera are a poor representation of what I believe: all innocent lives- Israeli and Palestinian- should be spared, and all terrorist organizations should be condemned and punished. I can't take back what I did, but I apologize to everyone impacted from the broader society, to my friends, parents and sister,"" Deyhimi wrote in her since-deactivated Instagram account. ""I have found it increasingly difficult to know my place as a biracial brown woman, especially during these highly volatile times. I have felt more and more frustrated about the time we currently find ourselves in, and misplaced that anger into actions that are not an accurate representation of who I am as a person.""
Several videos from around the country have shown other pro-Palestinian supporters tearing down posters of Israeli hostages, becoming a growing trend in the U.S. 
University of California-Davis assistant professor Jemma Decristo had an ominous message appearing to threaten what she called ""Zionist journalists"" and their families. 
Decristo took to X on Oct. 10 and wrote ""one group of ppl we have easy access in the US is all these zionist journalists who spread propaganda & misinformation.""
""They have houses w addresses, kids in school,"" Decristo said. ""they can fear their bosses, but they should fear us more.""
Included in the post were a knife, ax and three blood drop emojis. 
UC-DAVIS PROFESSOR UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR ‘REVOLTING’ POST THREATENING THE CHILDREN OF ‘ZIONIST JOURNALISTS’
Chancellor Gary S. May released a statement condemning her comments and said the university had launched an internal investigation. UC-Davis also scrubbed her page from the faculty website. 
Decristo also appeared to celebrate a riot outside the Israeli embassy in Jordan where it was set on fire, reacting ""HELL YEAH"" with Palestinian flags and fire emojis and called for the burning of the U.S. embassy in Lebanon. 
A bizarre incident was reported out of Stanford University where an instructor allegedly asked Jewish and Israeli students to identify themselves. Three students told Rabbi Dov Greenberg, director of the Chabad Stanford Jewish Center, that the instructor told them to gather their belongings and stand in the corner because ""this is what Israel does to the Palestinians.""
""The instructor then asked, ‘How many people died in the Holocaust?’ When a student answered, ‘Six million,’ the lecturer said, ‘Colonizers killed more than 6 million. Israel is a colonizer,’"" The Jewish publication The Forward reported. 
The instructor, who was never identified, was benched pending an investigation, according to Stanford University. 
Hundreds of Hamas sympathizers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) chanted ""one solution, intifada, revolution"" at a protest.
""Intifada is not a call for resistance. Intifada is the name of acts of bombing and killing civilians in Israel in the Israel-Palestine conflict. It's the name of taking civilian lives in terrorist attacks in Israel. That is what intifada means. That is how it's defined,"" Jewish MIT student Liyam Chitayat told Fox News Digital.
Historically, what’s called as the First Intifada was a deadly series of attacks and protests carried out by Palestinians against Israelis during the 1980s. The Second Intifada occurred in the early 2000s as at least 1,000 Israelis were killed by terrorist attacks carried out by Palestinians using suicide bombers on buses and shooting civilians in the streets, bars and restaurants in cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
The rally was held by several student groups, including MIT Coalition Against Apartheid. That group issued a statement the day after the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, saying they ""hold the Israeli regime responsible for all unfolding violence.""
The national chapter of the far-left group Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) called Hamas' attack on Israel a ""historic win for the Palestinian resistance.""
""Today, we witness a historic win for the Palestinian resistance: across land, air, and sea, our people have broken down the artificial barriers of the Zionist entity, taking with it the facade of an impenetrable settler colony and reminding each of us that total return and liberation to Palestine is near,"" SJP wrote on social media. ""Catching the enemy completely by surprise, the Palestinian resistance has captured over a dozen settlements surrounding Gaza along with many occupation soldiers and military vehicles. This is what it means to Free Palestine: not just slogans and rallies, but armed confrontation with the oppressors.""
SJP also encouraged its local chapters to participate in a ""call for action"" protest at universities across the country. 
Cornell University professor Russell Rickford celebrated Hamas' attack against Israel, calling it ""exhilarating"" and ""energizing"" at a rally on Oct. 17. 
""Hamas has shifted the balance of power. Hamas has punctured the illusion of its invincibility. That’s what they’ve done. You don’t have to be a Hamas supporter to recognize that. Hamas has changed the terms of debate,"" Rickford said to the crowd. ""It was exhilarating, it was energizing. And if it weren’t exhilarating by this challenge to the monopoly of violence – by this shifting to this balance of power – then they would not be human. I was exhilarated.""

Rickford, who teaches post-Civil War African American history, issued an apology following blowback.
""I apologize for the horrible choice of words that I used in a portion of a speech that was intended to stress grassroots African American, Jewish, and Palestinian traditions of resistance to oppression,"" Rickford said in a letter published in the Cornell Daily Sun. ""I recognize that some of the language I used was reprehensible and did not reflect my values."" 
He has since taken a leave of absence from Cornell.
Jewish students at New York City's Cooper Union were forced to lock themselves in a school library upon feeling threatened by anti-Israel protesters.
The protesters are seen banging on the locked library door chanting ""Free Palestine"" and demanding to be let in.
The New York Police Department told the press Thursday there was ""no direct threat"" to the Jewish students during the ordeal at the university library and downplayed the severity of the disruption.
NYPD agreed to place uniformed police officers on the Cooper Union campus the day following the incident to maintain peace.
Hamas sympathizers at George Washington University made themselves present by projecting their message on the side of the Gelman Library building.
""Glory to Our Martyrs,"" one message read.

Other messages took aim at the university itself, reading ""GW the Blood of Palestinians is on Your Hands"" and ""Your Tuition is Funding Genocide in Gaza.""
The university later responded in a statement that the ""unauthorized"" messages ""violated university policy, and leadership intervened to ensure that these projections were removed.""
The university continued, ""The statements made by these individuals in no way reflect the views of the university. We are reviewing this incident and will take any appropriate steps with respect to the individuals involved in accordance with university policies.""
MEDIA RUNNING HAMAS NARRATIVE ON GAZA HOSPITAL ‘DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED’ TO ENDANGERING US EMBASSIES ABROAD
Both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel supporters gathered for rival protests at Tulane University on Thursday, but things quickly escalated when a pickup truck pulled up with two pro-Palestinian supporters in the back with one waving a Palestinian flag and the other attempting to set fire to an Israeli flag.
A Jewish student rushed over to take the flag before it was burned, prompting the pro-Palestinian to hit the student with the flagpole. 
Another pro-Palestinian supporter then assaulted the Jewish student, sparking more mayhem at the protest. Police are seen attempting to separate the two sides. 
Cornell University police and the FBI are investigating a series of threats made against the school’s Jewish community. The threats were posted to a website not affiliated with the university and targeted ""104 West,"" where the Center of Jewish Living is located on campus.
One of the threats called for people to follow a Jewish person home and ""slit their throats,"" adding, ""Rats need to be eliminated from Cornell.""
School President Martha E. Pollack issued a statement on Sunday, calling the messages ""horrendous.""
""We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,"" she said. ""This incident highlights the need to combat the forces that are dividing us and driving us toward hate.""

Turkey’s Erdogan laments loss of Ottoman Empire at pro-Palestinian rally,2023-10-30,Fox News,['Greg Norman'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the Israel-Hamas war and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
During a massive rally in Istanbul in support of Palestinians over the weekend, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lamented the loss of the Ottoman Empire, vowing that his country must ""never allow new Gazas to emerge again,"" a report says. 
Erdogan compared cities in Greece, Macedonia, Syria, Iraq and Gaza to ones in Turkey, saying that they were ""an inseparable part of the homeland’s territory,"" according to Abdullah Bozkurt, a journalist and director of the Nordic Research & Monitoring Network. 
""A century ago, for this nation and this country, Gaza was what Adana is,"" Erdogan reportedly said. 
""They separated us from all these lands that are as much a part of us as our blood, our life, and our love,"" he continued.

University of Pennsylvania grapples with donor crisis after ‘Palestine Writes’ event causes uproar,2023-10-20,Fox News,['Yael Halon'],"Jewish model and activist Elizabeth Pipko blasts pro-Palestinian demonstrators criticizing Israel at college campuses across the U.S.
A prominent University of Pennsylvania donor sent his alma mater a $1 check with an annual pledge for the same amount as long as UPenn President Liz Magill remains at the school, joining a handful of other mega-donors who continue to withhold donations over the school's response to the Israel-Hamas conflict and accusations of excusing antisemitism.
He's just one of several major donors that's calling for changes at the top as the elite university grapples with the fallout of a recent on-campus event. It's gotten to the point that alumni president Michael Barrett penned a letter to his fellow Quakers reaffirming support for Magill, defending the school's handling of the situation and criticizing the ""misinformation"" and heavy scrutiny the school has faced this month. 
On Sunday, Magill released a statement saying the school didn't move fast enough to address criticism of the ""Palestine Writes"" event and strongly condemned the Hamas ""terrorist assault"" on Israel; her initial statement to the school didn't refer to Hamas a terrorist group, although it called its attack ""abhorrent"" and ""horrific.""
Here are the donors who are speaking out against the university.
JONATHON JACOBSON
Jonathon Jacobson, a 1983 Wharton graduate and founding member of private investment firm HighSage Ventures LLC, announced his reduced donation in a letter obtained by Fox News, in which he scolded his alma mater for its lack of ""moral courage"" and inability to distinguish between ""what is clearly right and clearly wrong.""
Jacobson, who has previously given ""multi-seven figure donations,"" to the university in addition to student scholarships and financial support for the school’s sports program, called out UPenn leadership for its ""completely inept"" handling of the Palestine Writes festival that took place on campus in September and ""too little too late"" statement on the Hamas terrorist attack which killed at least 1,400 Israelis and 31 Americans.

""Enclosed is a check for $1 which represents the first installment of a multi-year pledge which we will renew until you find employment elsewhere and the board of trustees grows the backbone to fulfill its mission, which is to govern the university according to the principles upon which it was founded,"" Jacobson wrote in the letter addressed to Magill.
""The university that I attended and that shaped me, is virtually unrecognizable today, and the values it stands for are not American ones,"" he continued.
Jacobson accused the school of ""hiding behind free speech"" as an excuse for its ""fecklessness"" in the two-page letter, further tearing into the leadership, who he described as a ""product of a very screwed up higher-ed system.""
""Unfortunately,"" he wrote, ""an entire generation of our kids is also a product of this system and this ideology, which is now deeply ensconced at Penn and other countless universities, has now also affected the media, our legal apparatus and Congress.""
""We live in an unserious and highly dangerous time,"" he added. ""Enough. It is time to reverse this trend and restore our ‘elite’ universities to the principles upon which they were founded: as places of inquiry, where lively debate, diversity of opinion and communication across lines of difference is not only cherished, but actually mandated.""
MARC ROWAN
Jacobson was likely inspired by Apollo CEO Marc Rowan, who earlier this week called on prominent UPenn donors to send $1 checks with the hopes of forcing a change in leadership at the university. The outrage began after the school hosted a Palestinian literary festival on campus which included speakers with a history of antisemitic comments, including calls for ""death to Israel."" Many donors reached their boiling point when the University failed to, in their view, immediately condemn Hamas' vicious attack.
The billionaire private equity firm CEO, also a Wharton graduate, called for donors to ""close their checkbooks"" in a letter sent to the school’s newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian, where he demanded the resignation of Magill and Scott Bok, chair of the board of trustees. Rowan is the chairman of the board of advisers to the Wharton School, UPenn’s elite college of business, and in 2018 he and his wife gave the business school $50 million.

""It took less than two weeks to go from the Palestine Writes literary festival on the University of Pennsylvania’s campus to the barbaric slaughter and kidnapping of Israelis,"" Rowan wrote.
""The polarizing Palestine Writes gathering featured well-known antisemites and fomenters of hate and racism, and it was underwritten, supported and hosted by various UPenn academic departments and affiliates.""
After several students expressed concern with the event, UPenn issued a statement signed by Magill and Provost John Jackson Jr. arguing that it was a ""public event"" and wasn’t organized by the university. 
Still, the school leaders said they support ""the free exchange of ideas,"" including ""the expression of views that are controversial and even those that are incompatible with our institutional values.""
Outrage among donors only intensified following Hamas’ terror attack on Israel, forcing Magill and Jackson to put out a separate statement.
 ""We are devastated by the horrific assault on Israel by Hamas that targeted civilians and the taking of hostages over the weekend. These abhorrent attacks have resulted in the tragic loss of life and escalating violence and unrest in the region,"" they said. Many members of our community are hurting right now. Our thoughts are especially with those grieving the loss of loved ones or facing grave uncertainty about the safety of their families and friends.""
DAVID MAGERMAN
On Tuesday, venture capitalist and philanthropist David Magerman joined the growing list of donors severing ties with the university for not taking a bolder stance against antisemitism. In a letter he shared on LinkedIn, Magerman, an observant Orthodox Jew and Penn donor, wrote that he was ""deeply ashamed"" to be associated with the university following the Palestine Writes festival and that he wouldn't donate another dollar. 
Magerman called on all ""self-respecting Jews"" to ""dissociate themselves"" from the university.

""There is no action anyone at Penn can take to change that. I’m not asking for any actions,"" he wrote. ""You have shown me who you are. My only remaining hope is that all self-respecting Jews, and all moral citizens of the world, dissociate themselves from Penn,"" the letter, dated October 15, said. 
But unlike some of his fellow donors, Magerman said he found calls for Magill's resignation insufficient.
""I feel your firing is unnecessary, because it is wholly inadequate,"" he wrote. ""If in fact the University of Pennsylvania as an institution has such a misguided moral compass that it can fail to recognize evil when it is staring us all in the face, I don’t think replacing you will accomplish anything. Frankly, I don’t think there is anything anyone can do to redeem the school, short of rebuilding its moral foundations from the ground up,"" he wrote. 
Magill issued a statement on Sunday, the same day Magerman wrote the letter, and said the university should have moved faster to share their position and clarify that they did not endorse the views of the speakers at the controversial event.
""I know how painful the presence of these speakers on Penn’s campus was for the Jewish community, especially during the holiest time of the Jewish year, and at a University deeply proud of its long history of being a welcoming place for Jewish people. The University did not, and emphatically does not, endorse these speakers or their views. While we did communicate, we should have moved faster to share our position strongly and more broadly with the Penn community,"" Magill said. 
RONALD LAUDER
Billionaire Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics empire and a major donor to the University of Pennsylvania, informed the school this week that he is now ""reexamining"" his financial support for the institution after it allowed people with histories of ""outright antisemitism"" to speak at the festival event on campus despite his repeated pleas to have it canceled.
In a letter obtained by Fox News, Lauder  – whose family funded the creation of the Lauder Institute at UPenn's famed Wharton School – lambasted Magill and the Ivy League institution for refusing to cancel the event in September.
""I told you that those invited to the event had a history of not just strong anti-Israel bias, but outright antisemitism. You were already aware of much of this,"" Lauder wrote. ""I now know that the conference has put a deep stain on Penn’s reputation that will take a long time to repair.""

Lauder said he sent two people to the event on his behalf, who reported ""antisemitic and viscerally anti-Israel"" remarks from the panel of controversial speakers.
The billionaire, who is president of the World Jewish Congress, added that ""the timing of the event could not possibly have been worse.""
""I have spent the past 40 years fighting antisemitism all over the world and I never, in my wildest imagination, thought I would have to fight it at my university, my alma mater and my family's alma mater.""
""Let me be as clear as I can: I do not want any of the students at The Lauder Institute, the best and brightest at your university, to be taught by any of the instructors who were involved or supported this event,"" Lauder wrote. ""In my mind, they put their bias against Israel ahead of any academic honesty. We know who they are and what they said.""
Lauder has not yet ruled out future donations to the university, but said Magill is ""forcing"" him to reexamine his financial support ""absent satisfactory measures to address antisemitism at the university.""
""Liz, you should know that this letter is written with the greatest sorrow, a sorrow I never expected to encounter at Penn and a sorrow and one I don't think I will get over,"" he concluded. ""I am so sorry you did not cancel the event.""
JON HUNTSMAN
Former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr. also recently announced his foundation would be stopping donations to the school over the controversy.

""To the outsider, it appears that Penn has become deeply adrift in ways that make it almost unrecognizable,"" Huntsman wrote in an email obtained by The Daily Pennsylvanian. ""Moral relativism has fueled the university’s race to the bottom and sadly now has reached a point where remaining impartial is no longer an option."" 
""Consequently, Huntsman Foundation will close its checkbook on all future giving to Penn – something that has been a source of enormous pride for now three generations of graduates,"" the former governor wrote. 
CLIFFORD ASNESS
Clifford Asness, a hedge fund manager and co-founder of AQR Capital Management who holds degrees from the university, wrote to Magill to say ""what has been going on at Penn is unacceptable"" and that the school has turned away from freedom of thought and expression, according to a copy of the letter posted on X.
He said he has ""long been dismayed"" about the ""drift away from true freedom of thought, expression and speech at our best Universities, very much including my beloved alma mater Penn.""

Asness described the Palestine Writes festival as an ""antisemitic Burning Man festival"" that ""pushed matters further.""
""I’m 100% for free speech but not asymmetrical free speech where some have it and some don’t. Imagine Penn’s action if that event was as anti-anyone else other than Jews!? Hiding behind ‘free speech’ when it is a right only embraced for antisemites and other fellow travelers is not OK.""
Asness echoed some of his fellow donors who took issue with the university’s response to Hamas’ terror attack on Israel.
""Of course, most distressing to me was your first statement making vague equivalences between the intentional murder of children (and others) by terrorists and the accidental injury to children that sadly occurs when murdering terrorists hide behind children to escape justice,"" he wrote. ""There is no semblance of equivalence. I must believe this equivalence was not your goal. But it clearly reads that way to me.""
He indicated that having recently completed a five-year pledge of donations to UPenn, he ""will not be considering another until such meaningful change is evident.""
 ""I do not like making something like this about money – but it appears to be one of the only paths that has any hope of mattering,"" he concluded, ""and it has become clear that is the only voice some of us have.""
Penn isn't the only Ivy League school that's landed in hot water since Hamas' attack on Israel last week. Harvard has been the center of controversy, with pro-Palestinian student groups releasing a joint statement claiming Israel was ""entirely responsible"" for Hamas’ attack. It said, ""Today's events did not occur in a vacuum. For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison.""
Separately, multiple pro-Palestinian student groups hosted a march and ""die-in"" at Harvard Business School Wednesday in protest of what they deem Israel’s ""genocide"" of Palestinians in Gaza.

The Wexner Foundation, a nonprofit started by Victoria’s Secret founder Leslie Wexner and his wife Abigail, announced in a letter this week that they will be stopping their funding to Harvard, saying they were ""sickened and stunned"" by the school's ""dismal failure"" to take an unequivocal stand against the ""barbaric murders of innocent Israeli civilians."" They accused the school of ""tiptoeing"" around the issue and announced a hard stop to their financial and programmatic support of the university in a letter obtained by Fox News.
On Monday, Scott Bok, the Chair of the Penn Board of Trustees, released a statement about a meeting with Magill where Trustees condemned the Hamas attacks and Magill in turn outlined plans to ""enhance education and training to combat antisemitism on campus.""
""The unanimous sense of those gathered was that President Magill and her existing University leadership team are the right group to take the University forward,"" he said.
For her part, Magill released a statement Tuesday, ""Alumni are important members of the Penn community. I hear their anger, pain, and frustration and am taking action to make clear that I stand, and Penn stands, emphatically against the terrorist attacks by Hamas in Israel and against antisemitism. As a University, we support and encourage the free exchange of ideas, along with a commitment to the safety and security of our community and the values we share and work to advance. Penn has a moral responsibility to combat antisemitism and to educate our community to recognize and reject hate in all its forms. I’ve said we should have communicated faster and more broadly about where we stand, but let there be no doubt that we are steadfast in our beliefs.""
Reached for comment, a University of Pennsylvania spokesperson directed Fox News Digital to Bok and Magill's recent comments and statements on the matter.

Josh Giddey’s agent fired for criticizing BLM Chicago’s pro-Palestine post: report,2023-11-30,Fox News,['Ryan Morik'],"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Josh Giddey's agent, Daniel Moldovan, was reportedly fired from his role as an executive vice president at the Octagon agency for speaking out against a viral pro-Palestinian post.
Moldovan criticized the pro-Palestinian post that made the rounds on the internet through BLM Chicago's X account, formerly Twitter, that was also shared on Instagram.
The since-deleted post from Oct. 10 was a figure paragliding with a Palestinian flag with the caption ""I STAND WITH PALESTINE.""

A community note pointed out that over 260 people were killed by Hamas terrorists in paragliders at the Tribe of Nova music festival in southern Israel three days prior.
""72 hours after terrorists paraglided into a music festival and slaughtered 260 young people. This is how BLM chose to symbolize where their support lies,"" Moldovan is said to have written. ""F--- BLM and anybody who supports them.""
Octagon told journalist Ethan Strauss that Moldovan's remarks were ""divisive, disparaging, and corrosive"" and ""do not represent our values or what we stand for.""
""We immediately launched an investigation into the reported incident. It was determined that Daniel’s comments and actions were in gross violation of our policies that are in place to protect the longstanding integrity of the company, its employees and clients, and we promptly terminated his employment,"" the agency said.
""Octagon does not discourage political discourse, as long as it’s done in a positive and constructive manner. Divisive and disparaging language, and hate speech toward any people or communities, goes against our company values and policies,"" they added.

Neither Moldovan nor Octagon responded to requests for comment.
RealGM currently lists Giddey as a client of Moldovan's, where he is still named as an Octagon employee.
Giddey is currently under investigation by both the NBA and police over accusations that he had an inappropriate relationship with a minor.
Giddey, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, was accused last week in a since-deleted post on social media of having an improper relationship with an underage girl. According to The Associated Press, an anonymous social media user alleged that a girl seen with Giddey in videos and photographs was a high school junior at the time.

Outrage as UN-Palestinian exhibition uses murdered Israeli child’s image as Palestinian martyr,2023-12-01,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"Gilad Erdan took a firm stance against the surge in antisemitism, insisting the ""time for words has passed"" and that action must be taken now to ""ensure that no Jew lives in fear.""
The United Nations office in Geneva removed multiple photos from a pro-Palestinian exhibit after several critics, including the Israeli mission, noted that dead Israeli children had been included.
""Hamas killed Ido,"" the Israeli mission to the U.N. in Geneva posted on X, formerly Twitter. ""We call on [U.N. Geneva Director-General Tatiana] Valovaya to immediately remove this exhibition, which spreads misinformation and is part of a propaganda campaign.""
The mission first flagged the misinformation on Thursday after identifying the picture of a 5-year-old named Ido Avigal among the pictures of Palestinian children allegedly killed by Israel in Gaza. The mission said that Avigal had died in 2021 when a Hamas rocket barrage hit his house in Sderot, and it called his inclusion in the exhibition ""despicable.""
Another user noted that the exhibit also included the picture of a Palestinian teenager who allegedly served in the Mujahideen Brigades, another extremist group based in Gaza and the West Bank. The U.N. did not confirm the veracity of any specific claim but acknowledged that some errant photos were posted ""near"" the exhibition and disavowed them.
UNITED NATIONS CHIEF BREAKS SILENCE ON HAMAS TERRORISTS' SEXUAL VIOLENCE, AGREES TO INVESTIGATE OCT 7 ATTACK
""While some people may indeed have seen [the photos] as the exhibition was in a public area, our colleagues were notified very quickly and very quickly put them down,"" Alessandra Vellucci, director of the United Nations Information Service, told Fox News Digital.
Velluci acknowledged that multiple ""images"" were included in the exhibit but insisted they ""were not there for long."" She said that no one saw who included the images. 
Vellucci explained that the Geneva U.N. office included the exhibit as part of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people – an annual observance dating to 1977 on the day when the General Assembly had 30 years earlier voted to adopt the resolution on the partition of Palestine.
ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR: WHO SAYS DISEASE COULD BE BIGGER KILLER THAN BOMBS IN GAZA UNLESS IMMEDIATE ACTION IS TAKEN
""The exhibition was organized in accordance with the GA resolution 60/37 of 1 December 2005, which requested the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and the Division for Palestinian Rights to organize an annual exhibit on Palestinian rights or a cultural event in cooperation with the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the U.N.,"" Vellucci said.
""However, before the commemoration started, additional images – including the one you refer to – were found to have been posted near the official exhibition,"" Vellucci continued. ""They were immediately removed as they were not part of the official, authorized exhibition.""

""The director-general was not informed in advance about these additional images, and as I said, her staff immediately took them off,"" she added, promising to reach out to the Israeli mission for any potential information on the issue. 
Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said he had no knowledge about the exhibit or who organized it, but a critic slammed the New York headquarters for continuing to perpetuate its own forms of misinformation with two videos near the public entrance that amount to a form of ""blood libel."" 
ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR: US LOOKS TO INCREASE AID INTO GAZA THROUGH EGYPT, INCLUDES WARNING FOR ISRAEL
""At UN Headquarters in New York the public entrance currently has an exhibition for the same occasion that has a litany of grotesque blood libels,"" Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, told Fox News Digital.

She described how one video claims that ""leading Zionist politicians"" pursued ""the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians"" while the other video accused Israel of promoting an ""apartheid"" state driven by ""the capacity of the sword to defeat the soul."" 
Bayefsky argued that these videos convey the image of Jews who ""massacre"" hapless Arab civilians while saying ""absolutely nothing about 75 years of successive Arab wars launched to annihilate the Jewish state.""

""Where is the outrage of this vile incitement of Jew hatred that is funded and organized by the United Nations itself, together with its Palestinian partners?"" Bayefsky said.

College groups across U.S. stage ‘walkout’ protesting U.S. military funding to Israel,2023-10-25,Fox News,['Hanna Panreck'],"A panel of college students spoke with FOX News' Lawrence Jones about the anti-Semitism they have faced since the Israel-Hamas war began. 
Student groups supporting Palestinians are holding a national walkout on Wednesday in support of Gaza and to protest U.S. funding of Israel, according to posts by pro-Palestinian student groups on social media.
Several university groups associated with the Palestinian movement hosted a walk-out, according to the national chapter of the far-left Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). It posted a map showing where the national walkouts were being held in partnership with Dissenters, an anti-war organization focused on forcing ""elected officials and institutions to divest from war and militarism.""
The walkouts are being held at over 100 college campuses, according to the social media post.
""Students from 100 campuses across North America will be walking out of classes and disrupting business as usual tomorrow for Gaza,"" the post said.

The national SJP and the Dissenters listed three demands, the first calling for an ""end to Israel's siege on Gaza.""

""We demand an end to U.S. military funding to Israel,"" their second demand said, according to the Instagram post. 
The groups also demanded that the universities ""fully divest from weapons corporations which arm Israel's occupation and genocide in Gaza.""
Colleges and universities such as Brown University, Columbia University, George Mason University, George Washington University, Rutgers, New York University, Howard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, UC Berkeley, Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, Tufts University, Yale University and more are among the 100+ college campuses participating in a walkout.

Following Hamas' terrorist attack against Israel on Oct. 7, several college groups protested in favor of the Palestinians and said the actions taken by Hamas were part of a liberation movement. 
About 30 Harvard University student groups faced widespread criticism for signing onto a statement blaming Israel for Hamas' attack. The Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups wrote, ""We, the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.""

Minneapolis teachers union backtracks on Israel-Hamas war resolution: 'We regret this',2023-11-27,Fox News,['Joshua Q. Nelson'],"Jeremy Cohen, a father of one in Minneapolis Public Schools, told Fox News Digital that the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers’ Local 59 resolution on the Hamas-Israel war was an inappropriate move.
The Minneapolis Federation of Teachers Local 59 (MFT) called for a members-only meeting to push a resolution that acknowledges harm done to Jewish residents in the Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) district.
The meeting comes after a backlash ensued when the teachers union passed a resolution that called for a repeal of anti-BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) legislation, claiming the measures suppress Palestinians' speech rights. 
Per a flier obtained by FOX News Digital, the teachers union will hold a meeting on November 29 to ""vote for a resolution acknowledging harm and affirming the purpose of our union.""
MINNESOTA FAMILIES OF MEN KILLED BY POLICE FILE LAWSUIT TO ACCESS INVESTIGATION FILES
A screenshot of South High School in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
""At the Nov. 29 MFT meeting, members will introduce and speak in support of a resolution that acknowledges harm done to Jewish members, students, and families by the previously passed ‘Israel-Palestine’ resolution and reaffirms the purpose of our union,"" the flier reads. ""The Oct. 25th resolution strayed far from MFT’s mission by not mentioning students or educators.""
MFT admitted that there was ""unnecessary division"" caused in the community by the Oct. 25 resolution. 
""While it was not MFT members' intent, the ‘Israel-Palestine’ resolution passed at our October 25 meeting harmed many Jewish members, students, and families while causing unnecessary division within our union. We regret this,"" the flier added. 
The local teachers union passed a resolution In October to ""condemn the role our [America] government plays in supporting the system of Israeli occupation and apartheid, which lies at the root of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict."" In addition, the resolution called on Minnesota state lawmakers to repeal anti-BDS legislation.

Jewish parents and other concerned citizens were outraged by the MFT's statement on the Israel-Hamas war, calling it ""antisemitic and hostile.""
The Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas organized and sent a letter earlier this month to interim Superintendent Rochelle Cox and the MPS school board to condemn the MFT.
The letter, signed by over 800 stakeholders, began by describing the difficult current political climate for Jewish people.

""This is a remarkably difficult time to be Jewish, but it is especially hard to be a Jewish teacher, student, or the parent of a Jewish child given the tremendous surge of antisemitism in our schools,"" the letter stated. ""For over a month, Jewish children in Minnesota have been bullied, gaslit, harassed, threatened, and even assaulted simply because they are Jewish.""
The letter continued, ""MFT’s resolution is antisemitic and hostile to our children, MPS staff, and puts our larger community at further risk because of their Jewish identity.""

Jeremy Cohen, a Jewish father of one child in MPS, told FOX News Digital the MFT resolution was an inappropriate move.
""To be clear, I think I would feel the same way. I know I would feel the same way. Had the resolution been drafted in any other way? Because I just don't think global politics has a place in the teachers union,"" he said.

Muslim leaders in swing states vow not to back Biden in 2024 over handling of Israel-Hamas war,2023-12-03,Fox News,['Bradford Betz'],"FOX News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the president's re-election bid on 'Special Report.'
President Biden’s campaign for re-election in 2024 is facing growing pressure from Muslim Americans who have vowed not to back him over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. 
On Saturday, Muslim leaders from several swing states – including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, Nevada, and Pennsylvania – descended on Dearborn, Michigan to coordinate a national response.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas dissolved the unity government with Hamas and declared the formation of an emergency government.  (Photo by Abid Katib/Getty Images)
Organizers have dubbed their campaign #AbandonBiden, and vow to make sure President Biden does not get a second term in office. 
Muslim and Arab leaders have been pushing the Democratic president to call for a cease-fire as the death toll from the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza continues to mount. As of Saturday, the death toll in the war was 15,200 Palestinians according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Some 1,200 Israelis have been killed, most during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas that triggered the war.
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas ended Friday after the IDF accused Hamas of firing at Israel. Hamas, meanwhile, has claimed that Israel rejected an offer to release more hostages. 
KIRBY BLAMES HAMAS FOR BREAKING CEASE-FIRE: ‘WE KNOW THEY ARE HOLDING’ MORE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
Minneapolis-based Jaylani Hussein, who helped organize the conference, said Biden's unwillingness to call for a cease-fire has damaged his relationship with the American Muslim community beyond repair. 
""Families and children are being wiped out with our tax dollars,"" Hussein said. ""What we are witnessing today is the tragedy upon tragedy.""
""The anger in our community is beyond belief. One of the things that made us even more angry is the fact that most of us actually voted for President Biden,"" Hussein, who is Muslim, told The Associated Press. ""I even had one incident where a religious leader asked me, 'How do I get my 2020 ballot so I can destroy it?""

Around 3.45 million Americans – or 1.1% of the country's population – identify as Muslim and the demographic tends to lean Democratic, according to Pew Research Center. Exit polls from 2020 conducted by AP show that some 64% of Muslim voters backed Biden, while 35% supported Trump. 
CHRIS CHRISTIE ‘CONFIDENT’ HE WILL BE ON FOURTH GOP DEBATE STATE, ADDRESSES POLL ACCURACY 
The White House has argued that President Biden has pushed for humanitarian pauses in the fighting to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, adding that ""fighting against the poison of antisemitism and standing up for Israel's sovereign right to defend itself have always been core values for President Biden.""
But Muslim leaders say the community's support for Biden has vanished as more Palestinian men, women and children are killed in Gaza.

""We are not powerless as American Muslims. We are powerful. We don't only have the money, but we have the actual votes. And we will use that vote to save this nation from itself,"" Hussein said.
Muslim leaders said their refusal to support Biden does not indicate they will support the front-runner in the Republican party: former President Donald Trump. 
""We don't have two options. We have many options. And we're going to exercise that,"" Hussein said.

"Israel releases image of eliminated Hamas figures enjoying meal, other leaders killed, IDF says",2023-12-05,Fox News,['Louis Casiano'],"FOX News’ Trey Yingst on the latest from Israel and the IDF considering a new tactic to target Hamas terrorists
The Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet security service released several images Tuesday discovered in tunnels constructed by Hamas, including one showing five senior figures of the terror group who were killed during a strike. 
The picture shows a group of Hamas leaders in a meeting while eating, according to a joint IDF and Shin Bet statement. The five led the Northern Gaza Brigade, the second largest in Hamas. 
""With assistance from the IDF Intelligence Directorate and the ISA, IDF soldiers eliminated the brigade's commander, Ahmed Al-Ghandoor, the Deputy Brigade Commander, Wael Rajab, and other senior operatives, including: the commander of the brigade's support battalion, the head of the technical and operational support department, and the observation officer for the northern Gaza Strip,"" the statement said.

Al-Ghandoor served as a member of the inner circle of Hamas' military wing, authorities said. He was responsible for directing and managing all terrorist operations of Hamas in the Northern Gaza Strip area.
The five figures were killed during a strike on a tunnel in which they were purportedly hiding, the IDF said. The tunnel was reportedly under civilian homes and close to an Indonesian hospital. 
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of shielding itself in and around civilian areas and sensitive locations like hospitals, homes and schools. 
Others killed include commanders of the Tsabra Battalion, Shati Battalion, Darj Tapah Battalion and Shejaiya Battalion, the IDF said.

The units were part of the Hamas’ Gaza City Brigade, its largest, the report said. 
In Shati Battalion sector, the IDF took control of its central strongholds. That battalion is responsible for the central headquarters of Hamas, including the Hamas headquarters at the Shifa hospital. 
In addition, the heads of its anti-tank, air formation and naval formation were eliminated, the IDF said.

DeSantis blasts Biden for prioritizing Gaza aid that will be ‘commandeered’ by Hamas over rescuing hostages,2023-10-17,Fox News,['Andrew Mark Miller'],"FOX News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on how 2024 Republican presidential candidates are responding to the war in Israel on ‘FOX News Live.’
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis slammed President Biden on Tuesday accusing him of prioritizing humanitarian aid to Gaza, which has reportedly been compromised by Hamas in the past, over rescuing American and Israeli hostages.
""Innocent Americans and Israelis are being held hostage by Hamas terrorists, yet Biden is more focused on sending ‘humanitarian aid’ to Gaza that will be commandeered by Hamas terrorists,"" the GOP presidential candidate posted on X Tuesday.  
""Biden should work with Israel to free all American and Israeli hostages, not shower Hamas with money.""
The DeSantis post included a screenshot of a Reuters news article with the headline ""US and Israel to develop aid plan for Gaza civilians, Blinken says.""

""Palestinian leadership is already bankrolling Hamas’ atrocities against Israel and Biden wants to send aid into Gaza that will further support terrorist activity,"" DeSantis said in a follow-up post. ""As President, I wouldn’t send a single dollar into Gaza.""
Biden has been widely criticized by Republicans for not moving quickly enough to secure the release of American hostages in Israel following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 as well as not doing enough to help the thousands of Americans stranded in Israel find a way home.
DeSantis recently took matters into his own hands by signing an executive order authorizing his state to send planes and resources to Israel to rescue stranded Americans.

DeSantis announced earlier this week that a flight carrying 270 people stranded in Israel landed in Tampa Bay, Florida.
""I am proud of how quickly we have been able to activate resources and do what the federal government could not – get Floridians and other Americans back home, reunited with their families, free of charge,"" DeSantis said in a press release.

The State Department announced last Wednesday, four days after the Hamas attack, that ""the U.S. government will arrange charter flights to assist U.S. citizens and their immediate family members who have been unable to book commercial transit and seek a safe means of departing Israel"" starting on Friday. 
Hamas is believed to be holding 199 Israelis hostages while 13 Americans are currently unaccounted for and are possibly being held by the terror group as well.
Additionally, questions have been raised about Hamas's ability to access humanitarian aid sent to Palestinian refugees.

Fox News Digital reported on Saturday that the Biden administration has sent hundreds of millions in taxpayer money, including tens of millions in COVID relief funds, to a United Nations agency accused of harboring Hamas terrorists in the past.
""The USA should not be placing conditions on our support for Israel because of demands from the ‘Squad,'"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said this week.  
""Humanitarian aid repeatedly ends up in the hands of Hamas terrorists who use it to build rockets & kill more Israelis. We should immediately halt U.S. aid for the Palestinians.""
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Biden says American citizens will leave Gaza through Rafah border crossing,2023-11-01,Fox News,"['Greg Norman', 'Chris Pandolfo']","Former DNC deputy press secretary Jose Aristimuno and former Georgia Rep. Doug Collins join 'The Faulkner Focus' to debate the Biden administration's response to the conflict in Israel.
President Biden on Wednesday said the U.S. has secured safe passage for wounded Palestinians and for foreign nationals to exit Gaza for Egypt. 
""We expect American citizens to exit today, and we expect to see more depart over the coming days,"" Biden wrote in a post on X. ""We won't let up working to get Americans out of Gaza."" 
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller later said during a press briefing that there are ""around 400 Americans in Gaza with whom we are in communication, who have expressed a desire to leave"" and that there are ""a number of American citizens who have crossed through Rafah and are in Egypt today.""
Egypt, Israel and Hamas earlier came to an agreement allowing limited evacuations out of Gaza and into Egypt through the Rafah crossing after Qatar mediated talks.

The deal allows for foreign passport holders and some critically injured Gaza residents to evacuate, though no timeline has been set for how long the crossing will remain open, a source briefed on the deal told Reuters. 
Dozens of foreign passport holders reportedly could be seen entering the crossing Wednesday morning in evidence of the deal. 
The negotiations came as the Israeli military has been carrying out the second stage of its war against Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces have greatly expanded ground operations in Gaza, clearing Hamas terrorists out of their fortified positions and tunnels. 
Military officials have warned that the campaign will be a long and difficult affair. So far, at least 16 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting.

""Why have Americans and foreign nationals still been unable to get out of Gaza, even though aid trucks have been going in?"" a reporter asked Kirby during Tuesday's White House press briefing. ""Beyond putting blame on Hamas, what more can you say about what's going on here and what the progress is?""

"Democrat ‘Squad’ member backs Rep. Tlaib’s use of chant which calls for ‘genocide,’ Israel’s destruction",2023-11-06,Fox News,['Greg Wehner'],"Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, on House Republicans' support for Rep. Mike Johnson as speaker, reports that Iran is providing intelligence to Hamas and his push for Rep. Rashida Tlaib to be banned from intel briefings.
Nearly a day after members of the Democratic Party called out Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for attempting to justify the pro-Palestinian chant, ""From the river the sea, Palestine will be free,"" fellow Squad member Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., is backing her up.
The chant references the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, where Israel exists.

On Friday, Tlaib turned to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to provide her interpretation of the Palestinian slogan seen splattered on protester posters and heard chanted at rallies supporting Palestine.
""From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate,"" Tlaib posted. ""My work and advocacy is always centered in justice and dignity for all people no matter faith or ethnicity.""

A group called StopAntisemitism responded to Tlaib’s post and told her the meaning refers to ""the full erasure of the Jewish state, from Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea,"" adding that she was echoing terrorists.
On Monday, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., expressed her opinion of Tlaib’s comments on X.
""Rashida Tlaib is calling for the genocide of the Jewish people,"" Blackburn said.

""As part of his role, he managed the funds in the organization and earmarked the funds for financing and directing terrorism inside and outside the Gaza Strip,"" the Israeli Air Force wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""He previously held security positions in the terrorist organization and as part of his role led several operations aimed at harming civilians in the State of Israel.""

"Pro-Palestinian student group plans national ‘day of resistance,’ calls for ‘mass mobilization’",2023-10-11,Fox News,['Hanna Panreck'],"Boston-area students reacted to Harvard student groups' letter blaming Israel for Hamas' acts of terrorism. Several students said they don't feel safe on campus.
The national chapter of the National Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) posted a ""call to action"" on social media Sunday and asked their student chapters to hold demonstrations at their colleges in support of the Palestinians. 
The National SJP's Instagram account called for their student groups to mobilize a ""day of resistance"" in support of the Palestinians following the terrorist attacks in Israel carried out by Hamas. 
Colleges and Universities such as Rutgers, the University of Virginia, Ohio State University, the University of Massachusets Amherst, Kent State University, New York University, University of North Carolina, University of Illinois, Butler and Purdue are holding a demonstration, some are calling it a ""teach in,"" in support of the Palestinians, according to posts on both the national SJP's Instagram as well as their collegiate chapters. 
""Join us at 5:30 PM Thursday, Oct 12th on the Rotunda steps for a teach in and demonstration about the current situation in Gaza, the events and history that led to this moment, and a discussion about how we can be in solidarity with Palestinians resisting occupation,"" the University of Virginia's chapter said in a post on Instagram.

SJP's toolkit, which they posted to social media, calls for their student groups to hold a protest, ""disruption"" or ""educational event"" in support of the Palestinians. 
""Today, we witness a historic win for the Palestinian resistance: across land, air, and sea, our people have broken down the artificial barriers of the Zionist entity, taking with it the facade of an impenetrable settler colony and reminding each of us that total return and liberation to Palestine is near. As the Palestinian student movement, we have an unshakable responsibility to join the call for mass mobilization,"" the introduction in the group's toolkit reads.
In their messaging and framing section, the SJP wrote that the ""responsibility for every single death falls solely on the zionist entity."" 
""The forces of Zionism engage in media campaigns which attack our people and resistance from all sides– it is our responsibility, therefore, to break through their hegemonic narratives of ‘war’ and ‘unprovoked aggression,’ and instead ground our campuses and communities in a narrative which centers the legitimacy of resistance and the necessity of complete liberation,"" the toolkit said. 
One student group planning to participate in the ""day of resistance"" is Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return (SUPER) at the University of Washington in Seattle, according to a social media post from the organization on Tuesday. 
In an Instagram post on Sunday, the group expressed its support for the Palestinians and accused the university of being ""complicit in the crimes of occupation"" of Gaza by Israel and ""inviting Zionist academics to speak on campus."" 
UW did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CASUALITIES, KIDNAPPED AND MORE NUMBERS SINCE HAMAS' ATTACK ON ISRAEL
The Anti-Defamation League's Center of Extremism published some research on the SJP's collegiate chapters and said their planned ""day of resistance"" could create a ""hostile environment"" for Jewish students on campus. 
""Although these are all non-violent tactics, they raise the real possibility of creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, and the confrontational spirit that permeates the toolkit raises the concern that these actions could lead to acts of harassment or vandalism targeting Jewish students and organizations,"" their blog post read. 
Jewish On Campus, a student-run campaign effort to combat antisemitism on college campuses, put out a statement on Instagram about the planned ""day of resistance.""
""As atrocities in Israel continue to unfold, several campus advocacy groups have doubled-down on blatantly antisemitic rhetoric, celebrating one of the worst terrorist attacks in human history, and justifying the murder of Jews,"" the group's post said.

FLASHBACK: Black Lives Matter co-founder called for ‘end’ of Israel in 2015,2023-10-11,Fox News,['Brian Flood'],"FOX News Eric Shawn provides details on the outrage facing BLM groups that voiced support for Palestine. 
Black Lives Matter groups have come under fire in recent days for throwing its support behind ""the resistance in Palestine"" following the deadly terror attacks on Israel by Hamas. But video has resurfaced on social media of Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors calling for the end of Israel back in 2015. 
""Palestine is our generation’s South Africa…if we don’t step up boldly and courageously to end the imperialist project called Israel, we’re doomed,"" Cullors said in a resurfaced, eight-year old video from a panel at the Harvard Law School. 
The Human Rights Program at Harvard Law hosted Cullors and several other activists in April of 2015 for a panel titled, ""Globalizing Ferguson: Racialized Policing and International Resistance."" During the panel, Cullors shared her experience in visiting the West Bank and Gaza in 2015 as part of a delegation with other far-left activists. She claims she witnessed ""violence"" and the ""terror"" against Palestinians which was caused by Israelis and ""Zionists.""
BLACK LIVES MATTER GROUP DEFENDS HAMAS TERROR AS 'DESPERATE ACT OF SELF-DEFENSE' THAT 'MUST NOT BE CONDEMNED'

""We witnessed people’s terror, people live in terror on a daily basis and nothing would have prepared me for how much clarity I would have on why we have to be a part of Palestinian solidarity,"" she said. 
She told the audience one way for Americans to fight back was to join the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to pressure Israel to change its policies toward Palestinians. 
Cullors, who has referred to herself as a ""trained Marxist,"" resigned from Black Lives Matter in 2021 amid scrutiny over her lavish real-estate buying binge. 
Black Lives Matter has been in the news in recent days, as Americans have largely been disgusted by the terror attack that left at least 1,200 people dead in Israel, while others were kidnapped, raped, and tortured by Hamas. Rather than express sympathy, Black Lives Matter Grassroots put out a statement declaring its support for Palestinians, saying, ""[W]e must stand unwaveringly on the side of the oppressed.""
BLM CO-FOUNDER PATRISSE CULLORS SAYS GROUP FLOODED WITH 'WHITE GUILT MONEY'

The post proclaimed that because the Palestinians ""have been subject to decades of apartheid and unimaginable violence, their resistance must not be condemned, but understood as a desperate act of self-defense."" 
The group, which was born out of the radical racial justice movement in America, cited ""clear parallels between"" the Black people oppressed in America and the Palestinians oppressed by Israel.
""As Black people continue the fight to end militarism and mass incarceration in our own communities, let us understand the resistance in Palestine as an attempt to tear down the gates of the world’s largest open air prison,"" Black Lives Matter Grassroots continued. ""For lasting peace to come, the entire apartheid system must be dismantled.""

Though separate from the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) formerly led by Cullors, Black Lives Matter Grassroots has continued to promote the BLM message abroad. The Grassroots group is a coalition of 26 BLM chapters across the U.S. and U.K. 
Another group, BLM Chicago, posted an image of a person paragliding with a Palestinian flag attached to its parachute with ""I stand with Palestine"" written beneath. Many of the terrorists who murdered innocent civilians in Israel on Saturday arrived via paraglider.

At the army base where Israel identifies its dead: ‘They went from house to house burning family after family’,2023-10-30,Fox News,['Ruth Marks Eglash'],"ZAKA commander Yossi Landau describes how Hamas tortured Israeli women and children on 'America Reports.'
Warning: This article contains graphic details that may be disturbing to some readers.
JERUSALEM, Israel – Three weeks after Hamas’ deadly massacre on multiple Israeli army bases, civilian communities and a music festival, Israel is still struggling to identify its dead, not only because of the size and scope of the surprise, multi-pronged terrorist attack, but also due to the sheer brutality carried out by thousands of Palestinian terrorists, say those working to identify the dead.
At the Shura Army Base, on the outskirts of the central Israeli city of Ramle, dead bodies and hacked-up body parts continued to pile up this week, still arriving from the country’s south in refrigerated trucks. 
At the base, army personnel and volunteers, as well as religious authorities officiating the delicate process, described seeing atrocities reminiscent of the Holocaust – imagery not often invoked in a country whose foundations grew out of the Nazi genocide against the Jews in World War II.

""During a war, each side tries to make a convincing argument that they are right but these kinds of atrocities we have not seen since the days of the Nazis,"" Col. Rabbi Haim Weisberg, head of the army's rabbinic division, said in an interview. 
""They went from house to house burning family after family,"" he said. ""We are seeing trucks still arriving filled with body bags that contain whole families – grandparents, mothers, fathers, and even little children are being brought down from the trucks."" 
""In normal times, the rabbis on this base deal with dead soldiers, but this time it is abnormal,"" said Weisberg of the base that is just one among several involved in the identification process. 
""Here we have identified hundreds of bodies and there are still many more waiting to be examined,"" he said.
Weisberg described how some of the bodies were so badly burned that regular DNA testing was useless. In many cases, dental forensic teams were called in and forced to track down the personal dental records of the victims. In some extreme cases, even those methods have not been effective. 
Along with the more than 1,400 people murdered in the attack and an additional 239 now confirmed by the Israeli army as being held captive in the Palestinian enclave, a further 100 people still remain missing.

Since the Oct. 7 attack, the IDF’s special forces have been engaged in localized raids inside the Gaza Strip in order to retrieve dead bodies and body parts. Inside the devastated communities that sit along the border with Gaza, forensic archeologists have been called in to search for human remains. Earlier this week, a human jaw was found in a burnt-safe room. 
Families, including those who had hoped their loved ones might be still alive even if they were being held hostage by Hamas, are being informed all the time that their relatives are, in fact, among the dead.

Speaking at Shura, Weisberg described in graphic detail how one badly charred body turned out to be two victims – a mother and a baby bound together in a deep embrace. Another victim, he said, was a pregnant woman, her stomach cut open, her fetus pulled out and beheaded. The umbilical cord was still attached. 
""When you think about evil, you realize it is beyond comprehension when you see what this terror organization did,"" the rabbi said.

ISRAELI SURVIVORS OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK RECOUNT HARROWING BRUTALITY, HEROISM
The grisly work at Shura takes place in a large white tent surrounded by rows of refrigerated containers. Inside each dusty box are dozens of carefully wrapped bodies and smaller bags containing either babies and small children or body parts. The smell is overwhelming. 
In addition to the army personnel and the religious figures on site, there is also a team of female volunteers tasked with cleaning the bodies of murdered women. The group is part of a unique military reserve set up over a decade ago to deal with female combat soldiers who might be killed in action. 
""They wanted to have women who could deal with the burial and the identification procedure so that it wouldn't fall on young male soldiers and in order to protect the privacy of young women,"" said Shari, one of the volunteers who could not be named due to military guidelines. 
Shari said the group was specially trained by the army for a mass casualty event, but it was not until Oct. 7 that they were called up for service. Since then, she said, the unit has been working around the clock.

""I’ve seen things that no one should ever see,"" said Shari, describing how many of the dead women arrived still wearing their pajamas, their heads blown off and some booby-trapped with grenades. 
""We saw evidence of rape,"" Shari stated. ""Pelvises were broken, and it probably takes a lot to break a pelvis… and this was also among grandmothers down to small children. These are things we saw with our own eyes.""

Dozens arrested outside White House during protest over Israel-Hamas war,2023-10-16,Fox News,['Jon Michael Raasch'],"Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched to the White House advocating for a cease fire between Israel and Gaza and demanded that President Biden work to end the war.
WASHINGTON, D.C. – More than 30 protesters were arrested in front of the White House on Monday, according to the U.S. Secret Service. This comes after thousands of pro-Palestinian activists took to the streets of the nation's capital on Saturday to advocate for a cease-fire between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hamas militant group, urging President Biden to end the conflict.
""We need a cease-fire. We need innocent people to stop being killed,"" Mohamad Habehh, the director of development for the American Muslims for Palestine – which organized the Saturday rally – told Fox News. ""It seems that the Biden administration would rather condemn people calling for peace than try to step in.""

The ""Day of Action for Palestine"" event drew more than 10,000 pro-Palestinian protesters to Washington, D.C., on Saturday, according to the American Muslims for Palestine. Hundreds of Palestinian flags waved as demonstrators marched through the streets before culminating in a rally outside the White House. As rain poured down, a cohort of Palestinians, Americans, some Jewish people and more cheered for the freeing of Gaza and the end of the war between Israel and Hamas.

At least 2,800 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 11,000 have been wounded, many of which have been children, according to Palestinian health authorities.
Meanwhile, at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 30 Americans have been killed.

Israel’s military releases video after finding one of Hamas’ ‘largest weapons depots in the Gaza Strip’,2023-12-06,Fox News,['Greg Norman'],"Israel Defense Forces says depot was found near a clinic and school in northern Gaza. (Credit: IDF) 
Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have released footage on Wednesday showing what it says is ""one of the largest weapons depots"" it has found in the Gaza Strip during its ongoing war with Hamas. 
The IDF said the weaponry was discovered ""near a clinic and school in the northern Gaza Strip"" as the war nears its two-month mark.
""The depot contained hundreds of RPG missiles and launchers of various types, dozens of anti-tank missiles, dozens of explosive devices, long-range missiles, dozens of grenades and UAVs,"" it said. ""The weapons were seized by the soldiers.  
""All of the terrorist infrastructure was found close to civilian buildings in the heart of a civilian population,"" the IDF added.

US lets UN Security Council resolution calling for pauses in Gaza fighting pass without Hamas condemnation,2023-11-15,Fox News,['Adam Sabes'],"FOX News’ Alex Hogan reports on the latest in the Israel-Hamas war.
The United States allowed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for pauses in the fighting within Gaza to pass despite a lack of condemnation for Hamas.
Fifteen members of the security council passed the resolution Wednesday, which calls for a cease-fire for a ""sufficient number of days"" in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas. The resolution also calls for the ""unconditional release"" of hostages taken by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.
Twelve members of the council voted in favor of the resolution, while the U.S., Russia and Britain, who have veto power, abstained from the vote Wednesday.
The resolution doesn't include a condemnation of Hamas' actions. It attempted to pass a resolution four times before the council was successful.
UN FORMALLY CONDEMNS ISRAEL BUT STAYS MUM ON HAMAS TERRORIST ATTACKS: WATCHDOG

Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in her explanation of the vote that the U.S., ""could not vote yes on a text that did not condemn Hamas or reaffirm the right of all Member States to protect their citizens from terrorist attacks.""
""Although the United States is deeply disappointed by what is not in this text, we support many of the important provisions this Council has adopted,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""For starters, while this text does not include a condemnation of Hamas, this is the first time we have ever adopted a resolution that even mentions the word ‘Hamas.’""
Anne Bayefsky, director for the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, criticized the vote in a comment to Fox News Digital.

""In an outrageous display of moral chaos and diplomatic cowardice, the Biden administration threw Israel under the bus at the UN Security Council. Almost six weeks after the barbaric attacks of October 7th the Council has finally acted for the first time, and incredibly refused to condemn Hamas,"" Bayefsky said. ""The Council resolution said the hostages were ‘held by Hamas and other groups’ — not that they were raped, mutilated and kidnapped by Hamas. It never mentioned Israel’s UN Charter right of self-defense. It refers only to civilians ‘in Gaza' and never in Israel. It never mentions ongoing rocket attacks against Israelis. And yet the Biden administration refused to veto it.""

""The United States voted the same way as that moral stalwart Russia and merely abstained. It is shocking, morally bankrupt and bodes very badly for the future of humanity, since make no mistake: use of the United Nations to invert right and wrong is just as bad for Americans as it is for Israelis,"" Bayefsky added.
Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan called the resolution, ""disconnected from reality and is meaningless.""

""Regardless of what the Council decides, Israel will continue acting according to international law while the Hamas terrorists will not even read the resolution at all, let alone abide by it. It is unfortunate that the Council continues to ignore, not condemn, or even mention the massacre that Hamas carried out on Oct. 7, which led to the war in Gaza. It is truly shameful!"" Erdan said. ""Hamas's strategy is to deliberately deteriorate the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and increase the number of Palestinian casualties in order to motivate the UN and the Security Council to stop Israel. 
""It will not happen. Israel will continue to act until Hamas is destroyed and the hostages are returned.""

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was silent Tuesday when repeatedly asked if she had any comment on a shocking report Hamas had beheaded Israeli babies during their terrorist attack on Saturday that left at least 1,000 Israelis dead.
FOX Business reporter Hillary Vaughn confronted the far-left ""Squad"" member, who has criticized Israel for the attack, as she walked through a hallway on Tuesday.
""Congresswoman, Hamas terrorists have cut off babies' heads and burned children alive. Do you support Israel's rights to defend themselves against this brutality?"" Vaughn asked. However, Tlaib refused to respond to the reporter.

Vaughn peppered the congresswoman with similar questions but Tlaib continued not to answer.
""You can’t comment about Hamas terrorists chopping off babies’ heads? Congresswoman, do you have a comment on Hamas terrorists chopping off babies’ heads?"" she asked. ""You have nothing to say about Hamas terrorists chopping off babies’ heads? Do you condone what Hamas has done chopping off babies’ heads, burning children alive, raping women in the streets? You have no comment about children’s heads being chopped off?"" 
As Tlaib and her staff entered an elevator, the reporter asked Tlaib why she continues to have a Palestinian flag displayed outside her office.
""Congresswoman, why do you have the Palestinian flag outside your office if you do not condone what Hamas terrorists have done to Israel? Do Israeli lives not matter to you?"" she asked before the Democrat exited the hallway.

'SQUAD' DEMS FACE BACKLASH CALLING FOR 'CEASEFIRE' AFTER ISRAEL ATTACK: ‘CAN’T MERELY CONDEMN TERRORISM'
The progressive congresswoman has a history of making controversial remarks about Israel. Following the Hamas terror attack, Tlaib appeared to blame Israel, while calling for U.S. support of its ally to end.
""I grieve the Palestinian and Israeli lives lost yesterday, today, and every day,"" the statement read. ""As long as our country provides billions in unconditional funding to support the apartheid government, this heartbreaking cycle of violence will continue.""
Tlaib has had the Palestinian flag outside her congressional office since at least January. 
One Republican has announced a measure to curb funding for any non-American flags displayed in the halls of Congress. The Palestinian flag was still prominently displayed outside Tlaib's office, as of Tuesday morning. 
Tlaib is the first congresswoman of Palestinian descent. She supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which has been condemned by the Anti-Defamation League as rooted in antisemitism.

400 Americans approved to leave Gaza as Israel-Hamas war rages,2023-11-02,Fox News,"['Rich Edson', 'Trey Yingst', 'Danielle Wallace']","John Rauschenberger on his family trying to flee from Gaza as the war escalates
Four hundred Americans have been approved to leave Gaza as soon as Thursday, Fox News confirmed. 
Fox News obtained a list of 400 names of U.S. citizens cleared to leave Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war rages on. 
Two sources involved in the negotiations say the 400 Americans are clear to leave as soon as today. 
The State Department was working to assign American citizens in Gaza specific departure dates. Officials say they’ll notify those in Gaza who’ve been in contact with the department. 
In addition to Americans, there are citizens from Mexico, Hungary, Croatia, South Korea, Azerbaijan, Greece, Chad, Bahrain, Italy, Switzerland, North Macedonia, Sri Lanka, the Netherlands and Belgium.

Included on the list of 400 Americans cleared to leave are 2-year-old Zain Ramiz Younis and 8-month-old Zaina Ramiz Younis. The siblings are U.S. citizens, but their mother, Folla Saqer, a U.S. permanent resident, was told she could not cross the Rafah border into Egypt with her kids, the family's attorney, Justin Eisele, told Fox News Digital. 
The family continues to implore the State Department and Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., for help.

Ibrahim Abu-Maghsib, the head of Hamas' anti-tank missile unit in the Central Camps Brigade, was killed in a fighter jet strike Thursday, Israeli officials announced.
The terrorist is accused of directing and carrying out ""many anti-tank attacks"" against Israeli citizens and military members, the Israel Defense Forces said.
Intelligence with the IDF and the Israel Securities Authority determined Abu-Maghsib was killed in the strike.
The Israeli Navy also struck Hamas anti-tank missile launching posts used to attack IDF troops operating in the Gaza Strip as part of the assistance offered to forces on the ground.
As Israel battles the Hamas terror group following an Oct. 7 assault inside its borders, authorities in the U.S. are urging awareness over the risk of ""lone wolf"" terror attacks on American soil.
Last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress ""terror threats have elevated"" amid protests and debate over the ongoing war between Israel and the Hamas terror group.

""The reality is that the terrorism threat has been elevated throughout 2023, but the ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United States to a whole other level,"" Wray said.
James J. Carafano, a homeland security expert and senior counselor to the president and E.W. Richardson fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington, D.C., said the government needs to prioritize law enforcement over politics.
Under the current administration, Carafano said the mantra has been that violent right-wing extremism is the major domestic threat, which he says ""is demonstrably false.""
Former NYPD inspector Paul Mauro also said that U.S.-based Hamas sympathizers represent a potential pool for radicalizing future lone wolf attackers.

""You didn’t have this enormous pool of sympathizers with what is a designated terrorist group, Hamas,"" Mauro said. ""That is a legal designation that has nothing to do with where you stand on the Israel-Palestinian conflict.""
Lone wolves are not unique to the Israel-Hamas war and have burst out in violence multiple times over the years, including in several high-profile attacks where there may have been missed warning signs.

The facility was used to produce and store unmanned aerial vehicles and weapons, the IDF said, and was located inside a residential building near schools in the center of the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in northern Gaza.
Explosives and operational plans were found right next to a bedroom that belonged to children, according to the force.

Brooke Goldstein, founder and executive director of the Lawfare Project, joined Sean Hannity on his show Wednesday night to discuss antisemitism in America and the censure of Rep. Rashida Tlaib.

""The very real threat that we are facing in the United States of America is pro-Hamas members of Congress, pro-Hamas indoctrination on our campuses funded by states like Qatar, and pro-Hamas rallies that are turning violent on our streets,"" Goldstein said.
Goldstein also called out Tlaib for her use of the antisemitic ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" chant and her support at pro-Hamas rallies by deeming her America's ""number one bigot.""
The Lawfare Project is a global network of legal professionals focused on fighting discrimination and defending the civil and human rights of Jewish people.


Israeli forces have destroyed 130 entrances to Hamas' terrorist tunnels since the war began on Oct. 7, according to the Israel Defense Forces.

While carrying out the mission, Israeli forces have discovered water and oxygen storage inside the tunnels, indicating the terrorist group is prepared for ""prolonged stays underground,"" according to the IDF.
According to earlier reports, the IDF's 252nd Reserve Division is conducting the ground operations in Gaza and, on Wednesday, secured the area of Beit Hanoun.
The commanding officer of the division said, ""it is our duty to restore peace and security to our civilians.”

New York City saw an increase in hate crimes during the month of October, largely driven by a spike in anti-Jewish incidents amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Even though crimes like shootings, murders, burglaries and grand larcenies were decreasing, the five boroughs saw a rise in bias incidents that were investigated by the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force.

WARNING: This post contains disturbing content
Israeli authorities are interviewing witnesses about reported sex crimes committed by Hamas terrorists during the October 7 attack, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

One eyewitness said that she she saw a young woman, who attempted to hide, be raped and murdered by the terrorists. At least two Hamas terrorists, who had military uniforms on, were involved in the gang rape.
""They bent someone over,"" the witness said. ""I realized he was raping her and passing her on to someone else also in uniform.""
The article also details that volunteers from the Orthodox organization Zaka recovered bodies of women who showed signs of sexual trauma.


Two family members of Hamas abductees joined ""Your World"" on Wednesday to discuss the October 7 attacks and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
Speaking to Fox News host Neil Cavuto, Merav Raviv and Itay Raviv explained that their family members were forcibly taken from a kibbutz on October 7. Merav's uncle and aunt were kidnapped, along with their daughter and grandson.
""My uncle and his wife... their only grandson, Ohad, [who] just turned nine on the 23rd of October. On that weekend. It was a holiday, the long weekend in Israel,"" Merav explained. ""Karen and Ohad just came to visit grandma and grandpa for the weekend, right? And they found themselves in that horrible Saturday morning.""
Itay spoke about the Re'im music festival massacre, and noted that Hamas terrorists killed Palestinians, Muslims and Christians in addition to Israelis.

""They just want to exterminate all Jewish people and they want to exterminate Israel, as they said bluntly and to the open as many times as possible,"" Itay said. ""And the world hasn't understood it enough, apparently.""
""But I think the number one goal should be first to release all the hostages, because this is just a cynical game that they're playing. They're saying, 'we will release hostages only if you have a cease fire,'"" he added. ""On October 6th, there was a ceasefire.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered remarks on the Israel-Hamas war on Thursday while in Tokyo for the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting.
In his speech, Blinken stressed the need to ""begin setting the conditions for durable peace and security and to frame our diplomatic efforts"" in order to prevent another conflict from arising.

""The United States believes key elements should include no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Not now, not after the war,"" he explained. ""No use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks. No reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends. No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. No reduction in the territory of Gaza.""
""We must also ensure no terrorist threats can emanate from the West Bank,"" Blinken added. ""We must also work on the affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace.""
The official also referenced the need to weigh ""the Palestinian people's voices and aspirations at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza.""

""It must include Palestinian led governance in Gaza, unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority,"" he asserted. ""And it must include a sustained mechanism for reconstruction in Gaza and a pathway to Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in states of their own, with equal measures of security, freedom, opportunity and dignity.""

Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett slammed the U.S. and other governments’ proposals that Israel should take a three-day pause in fighting Hamas, so they can get humanitarian aid into Gaza as well as negotiate getting hostages back from the terror group.
During an MSNBC interview with anchor Andrea Mitchell, Bennett – who also served as Chief of Staff for current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – criticized the proposal as a ""very bad idea.""

He insisted that will only serve to give Hamas time to regroup from Israel’s retaliatory strikes following the terror group’s Oct. 7 massacre inside the country.

U.S. military forces conducted an airstrike against a weapons facility in Syria Wednesday in retaliation for dozens of attacks against US bases in the region over the past several weeks.

U.S. troops in the Middle East have been attacked at least 42 times since mid-October, with two new attacks happening in the last 24 hours.
A U.S. defense official has confirmed the developments to Fox News on Wednesday. The recent attacks on U.S. bases began on October 17th, amid turmoil in the Middle East from the Israel-Hamas war.
American troops in Iraq and Syria has been repeatedly attacked by groups likely backed by Iran. Militants have been firing one-way drones and rockets.
The official explained that the newest attacks did not injure personnel or damage infrastructure. One of the incidents occurred at the al-Shaddadi base in Syria, while the other happened in Iraq.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III released a statement about the recent airstrikes on Wednesday.
""Today, at President Biden’s direction, U.S. military forces conducted a self-defense strike on a facility in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups,"" the statement read. ""This strike was conducted by two U.S. F-15s against a weapons storage facility. This precision self-defense strike is a response to a series of attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by IRGC-Quds Force affiliates.""
""The President has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today’s action to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests,"" the statement added.

NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby appeared on ""The Story"" Wednesday to discuss the latest developments with the Israel-Hamas war.
During his interview with Fox News host Martha Maccallum, Kirby contradicted Palestinian supporters' claims that the Israeli government is engaging in genocide.

""[Genocide is] a word that we absolutely would not ascribe to what's going on inside Gaza,"" Kirby asserted. ""That is not the goal of Israeli military forces: it's to go after Hamas...to ascribe what Israel is doing as genocide is is simply untrue, false and doesn't doesn't subscribe to the definition of what genocide is.""
""That said, Hamas very much has genocidal intentions,"" the official added. ""Their whole purpose is to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. And their purpose on [October 7th] was to do nothing but slaughter and take hostages. That is a genocidal war.""


A U.S. defense official confirmed to Fox News that the Iranian-backed Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone near the Yemeni coast, as the Israel-Hamas war continues.
""We can confirm that a U.S. military MQ-9 remotely-piloted aircraft was shot down while in international airspace over international waters off the coast of Yemen,"" the official said. ""U.S. Central Command officials are assessing the incident.”

The MQ-9 Reaper drone was reportedly surveilling Yemen when a Houthi militia fired at it. The drone is estimated to cost around $30 million.
The last time a MQ-9 Reaper was shot down by Houthi fighters was on June 6, 2019. The Biden administration removed the Houthis from the US list of terrorist groups in 2021.

They are living the Hamas high life.

While the people of Gaza live in poverty and have suffered under the horrors of Hamas, the terror group's leaders apparently are living high on the hog.
Israeli officials say Hamas leaders are billionaires, amassing an overwhelming jackpot of terror money for themselves.
""It's just really the numbers that are shocking, looking at the sheer amount of money that some of these terror chiefs have been able to sock away,"" Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at The Foundation For Defense of Democracies told Fox News.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) have gathered evidence showing that Hamas terrorists exploit civilian areas in Gaza, as the war continues.

""The Hamas terrorist organization exploits ambulances, hospitals, clinics, mosques, and schools for terrorist purposes,"" the IDF said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital. ""Hamas also uses ambulances to transfer weapons and terrorist operatives in the Gaza Strip.""
""This is another example of how the Hamas terrorist organization exploits civilian infrastructure and uses civilians as human shields,"" the statement added.
The IDF also released quotes from an ISA investigation of Hamas terrorists that planned the October 7 attacks.
""During combat, the ambulances are used, among other things, to evacuate fighters – commanders and operatives,"" the report read. ""They also transport food, cargo and weapons in them because that is the safest way to transport them.” 

“Most senior Hamas political and military officials are hiding in the hospitals, especially the Shifa Hospital,"" the statement added. ""They take advantage of the hospitals so that they will not be bombed.”

A French court has approved the deportation of Palestinian activist Mariam Abudaqa, who came to France for a speaking tour in September and was put under house arrest after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas.

The ruling, which overturns a court decision last month that the interior minister appealed, said 72-year-old Abudaqa, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), was ""likely to seriously disturb public order.""
The French government has cracked down on expressions of solidarity with Palestinians in the wake of Hamas's Oct. 7 attack which killed 1,400 people, banning protests, canceling events and accusing some pro-Palestinian groups of condoning terrorism.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says that, for the first time in the country's history, an entire reserve division is maneuvering in the Gaza Strip.
The forces have reportedly secured Beit Hanoun by demolishing Hamas tunnels and killing terrorists. The reserve has been operating since October 7, after the Hamas attacks on Israel.

""This is a defining moment for the division and for the entire reserve array in which a reserve division maneuvers alongside the regular divisions and proves the strength and quality of the IDF, in both regular and reserve service,"" Commanding Officer of the 252nd Division, BG Moran Omer, said in a statement. ""We have been preparing for this for years, it is our duty to now restore peace and security to our civilians.""

OPINION: Hamas made these 2 key mistakes when it launched October 7 terror attacks

Opinion article by Judith Miller
Hamas seems to have made two fundamental miscalculations in staging its barbaric October 7 attack on Israel.
First, its leadership clearly assumed that the United States would not continue to support Israel if it killed enough of the Palestinians whom Hamas has been using as human shields to protect its command centers and underground tunnel networks in Gaza.

Second, Hamas apparently assumed that if enough Palestinians in Gaza died in Israeli bombing, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and its patron Iran would escalate the conflict by opening a second front in the war, a scenario that has clearly worried both Israel and Washington.
Both calculations might still prove valid if Palestinian deaths and suffering in Gaza continue to command the world’s attention and spark increasing outrage, but Hamas’s hope that Iran and Hezbollah, which has de facto control of Lebanon, would escalate the conflict to defend Hamas and the Palestinians of Gaza seems to be misplaced.

Dem power broker doubles down on display of American-Israeli flag at Eagles game, disputes 'abuse'


Democratic power broker and New Jersey businessman George Norcross has doubled down on his decision to display an American-Israeli flag at a Philadelphia Eagles game over the weekend, and has disputed the team’s characterization that he was ""physically and verbally abusive"" toward stadium staff. 
In a piece written by Norcross and published on USA Today, the political boss explained his refusal to remove the flag, which was displayed just outside a private box at Lincoln Financial Field during Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys.

Norcross said he informed security that he would not take it down or allow the flag to be removed ""because it was important to make a clear statement that America was standing by its longtime ally, Israel, after 1,400 of its citizens were brutally murdered and hostages were taken by the terrorist group Hamas on Oct. 7.""
He wrote that he believed the flag was in line with the team’s statement from last month condemning the attacks, but was instead met with ""almost a dozen security staff jammed into the box."" 
""One aggressively went to rip off the flag. I stood up to block him and made it clear – loudly – that the flag would remain, and he could leave.""
Norcross alleged his arm was ""twisted"" behind his back and he was ""paraded out of the stadium in front of thousands as the flag was torn down and crumpled in view of the crowd."" 
""It is still unclear to me how the flag could be deemed 'obscene or indecent' or otherwise inappropriate.""

Jewish Democrat votes with Republicans to censure Tlaib for anti-Israel remarks

Jewish Rep. Brad Schneider was one 22 Democrats to vote alongside Republicans to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib over her anti-Israel remarks.
Tlaib was censured in a 234 to 188 vote on Tuesday night in a formal condemnation of her anti-Israel sentiment after she posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, using the controversial pro-Palestine slogan ""From the river to the sea.""

""That is not coded language,"" Schneider told ""America's Newsroom"" Wednesday. ""It was the chant, a rallying cry of the PLO in 1964, before Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza. It was the rallying cry and still is today of Hamas. It's calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and the murder of Jews.""
""We're elected representatives. We have an expectation to measure our words, to be considerate and to think about what we say and when we make mistakes, to stand up and correct them, and when a colleague refuses to do that and is throwing gasoline on a fire, that needs to be countered and addressed, and the record needs to be corrected,"" the Illinois Democrat continued. 
Critics argue the chant supports the annihilation of the Jewish state, although Tlaib has pushed back on those accusations, claiming to support ""peaceful coexistence"" for both Israelis and Palestinians. 

""'From the river to the sea' is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate,"" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""My work and advocacy has always centered in justice and dignity for all people no matter faith or ethnicity.""

Hospital used as Hamas underground terror HQ likely Israel's next big battle challenge

As the Israeli military shores up its strategic positions in northern Gaza, preparing to enter deeper into Hamas’ stronghold of Gaza City, one of the key points of battle, the army has indicated, is likely to be the Palestinian enclave’s largest medical center: al-Shifa Hospital.
 According to declassified intelligence materials shared with the media in recent weeks by IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, even as the hospital treats a growing number of wounded Gazans, Hamas terrorists operate beside it and beneath it in a labyrinth of tunnels that form the group’s military headquarters.
""Hamas uses hospitals as terror infrastructures,"" said Hagari, showing satellite imagery of the compound highlighting the areas where the IDF believes Hamas has forged tunnel shafts and hidden weapons. ""Hamas has turned hospitals into command and control centers and uses it as hideouts for terrorists and commanders.""
""Above ground, Al-Shifa is a hospital but below ground is something else,"" Itamar Ya’ar, a former deputy head of Israel’s National Security Council and a retired IDF colonel, told Fox News Digital.
He said al-Shifa had now become a stark ""symbol"" of the battle between Israel and Hamas.

Israel announces formal investigation of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, vows to bring 'terrorists to justice'

The Israeli State Attorney's Office announced that a formal investigation of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in Israel is underway on Wednesday.
The investigation is tasked with determining how the attack came as such a surprise to the Israelis as well as identifying all of the Hamas terrorists involved.

""It can be said at this stage, that the acts of horror are being investigated in the close cooperation of the General Security Service, the police of israel and the IDF, and that the investigation is being carried out in the close accompaniment of the Attorney General and his people, and under the supervision of the legal advisor to the government,"" the attorney's office said in a statement.

UN chief calls Israel's military operations ""clearly wrong,"" citing claimed civilian death toll


United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel's military operations in Gaza as ""clearly wrong"" on Wednesday, citing Hamas-provided civilian death tolls.
Guterres made the comments in an interview with Reuters, saying Israel was doing itself no favors with regard to ""global public opinion."" Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in Gaza, and its leaders have rejected all calls for a cease-fire.
""There are violations by Hamas when they have human shields. But when one looks at the number of civilians that were killed with the military operations, there is something that is clearly wrong,"" Guterres said.

""It is also important to make Israel understand that it is against the interests of Israel to see every day the terrible image of the dramatic humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people,"" Guterres said. ""That doesn't help Israel in relation to the global public opinion.""
Israel on Wednesday denied that there is a humanitarian crisis within Gaza, despite reports from on the ground indicating otherwise.

IDF claims no humanitarian crisis in Gaza

The Israeli military claimed there is currently no humanitarian crisis in Gaza on Wednesday, despite reports from on the ground indicating otherwise.
Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst interviewed an Israeli military spokesman who made the claim on Wednesday. Yingst, who has been on the ground in Gaza and spoken with doctors and other sources there, contested the spokesman's claim.
""We know, and I can say for sure, there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza,"" the official said. ""Obviously, the situation is not easy.""
""I would push back on that, sir. You're saying there's no humanitarian crisis in Gaza?"" Yingst pressed.
""I am saying once again: There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza,"" the official repeated. ""I know the situation is not easy, but we are in a war.""

Yingst spoke with a medical director of a Gaza hospital earlier Wednesday who stated that they had almost completely run out of supplies, particularly those for cancer patients.
The United Nations has also sounded alarms about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, saying many residents have little food and dwinding access to shelter.

South Africa to issue formal reprimand to Israeli ambassador


South Africa will call in Israeli ambassador Eliav Belotsercovsky to issue him with a ""demarche"", or formal reprimand, a senior foreign policy official said on Wednesday.

Dangor gave no further details of the demarche, a protest issued through diplomatic channels, and did not specify the reason for the reprimand.
South Africa criticized the ambassador this week over public comments he made, but did not specify what he had said.

South Africa has also recalled its diplomats from Israel to assess its relationship with the country as civilian casualties rise in Israel's war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Mills made the statement during a Wednesday appearance on Fox News. Recent polling shows that 63% of Americans disapprove of how Biden has handled the Israel-Hamas war so far.
He and 
Secretary of State Tony Blinken have warned Iran to stay out of the clonflict, but U.s. bases in Iraq and Syria have nevertheless suffered dozens of attacks by Iranian proxies in recent weeks.

Blinken says after Israel-Hamas war there should be 'no reoccupation of Gaza'

Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the U.S. believes there should be ""no reoccupation of Gaza"" after the Israel-Hamas war despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggesting that his country will likely control the territory’s security for an ""indefinite period."" 

Blinken, speaking Wednesday following a Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo, told reporters, ""Ultimately, the only way to ensure that this crisis never happens again, is to begin setting the conditions for durable peace and security and to frame our diplomatic efforts. 
""Now, with that in mind, the United States believes key elements should include no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, not now, not after the war,"" he said. ""No use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism. Or other violent attacks. No reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict hence, no attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. No reduction in the territory of Gaza. We must also ensure no terrorist threats can emanate from the West Bank."" 

Blinked added he has heard from Israeli leaders that ""they have no intent to reoccupy Gaza and retake control of that"" but ""the only question is, is there some transition period that might be necessary, and what might be the mechanisms that you could put in place for that, to make sure that there is security."" 
The remarks come after Netanyahu said Israel will likely control Gaza's security for an ""indefinite period"" following the end of its war on Hamas.

Hamas-run Palestinian authorities say over 10,300 people have been killed in Gaza, 40% children

Palestinian officials now say more than 10,300 people have been killed
 in Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, which entered its second month of fighting earlier this week. The humanitarian crisis in the Hamas-governed territory is expected to worsen and the staggering death toll – already three times higher than the number of American civilians killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks – is expected to rise as Israel’s ground invasion through Gaza City continues.
United Nations officials have stepped up their appeals for a humanitarian pause in Gaza, where whole communities have been destroyed and families are struggling for any semblance of normal life. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, the death toll includes about 4,000 children as basic supplies are running out and health care facilities are unable to tend to the wounded.

The level of death and suffering is ""hard to fathom,"" U.N. health agency spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva. ""Every day, you think it is the worst day and then the next day is worse.""
Israel declared war on Hamas after the terror group led an invasion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, and terrorists gunned down, slaughtered and burned 1,400 people in Israeli border towns, mostly civilians. Hamas also took approximately 240 hostages.
Israel's war on Hamas entered its second month on Tuesday.

Liberals outraged online after Rashida Tlaib is censured in Congress: 'SOLD OUT' by Democrats

Liberal and conservative commentators sounded off online after the House of Representatives voted to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for her support of antisemitic rhetoric.
Twenty-two Democrats voted with 212 Republicans to censure Tlaib after she was criticized for sharing a video on social platform X that included the phrase ""From the river to the sea,"" a pro-Palestinian used by Hamas that implies the destruction of Israel.
""If this is not worthy of censure, what is? When you can call for the annihilation of a country and its people, if that’s not worthy of a censure, what is?"" Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., said on the House floor Tuesday.

Some prominent supporters of Tlaib spoke out against her censure online.
MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan said that with so many Palestinians killed in the wake of the Hamas terror attacks on Israeli, American and other citizens, the censure of Tlaib was hard to believe. ""10,000-plus Palestinians killed, including 4,000-plus kids, and the U.S. House of Representatives is busy censuring… the only Palestinian-American member,"" Hasan wrote. ""Can’t make this stuff up.""

He called out Republicans for their rhetoric over Gaza. ""For the record, Republican Congressman Max Miller said Gaza would be turned into a ‘parking lot.’ GOP Congressman Brian Mast said Palestinian civilians are like Nazis. Republican senators Graham and Cotton said ‘level’ Gaza and 'bounce the rubble.' But they censured Tlaib.""

Israel's former prime minister denounced the idea of offering a military ""pause"" or cease-fire with Hamas, saying it would be inviting the enemy to rearm, strategize and inflict even more pain on the Israeli people.
Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israel is party to an ""inevitable war to eliminate Hamas"" and that there is no backing down until the terror threat is gone.
""There's no way that we can accept the terrorist state that did what it did on our border,"" he said, adding a pause will lengthen the war and bring about all the negative repercussions associated with a drawn-out conflict, like the human toll.

He compared it to a scenario in which the Allies would ask Axis powers for a cease-fire in the closing months of World War II.
""It would be tantamount to, say, January 1945, that the Allies would tell Germany, 'You know what, we're going to pause the war for a few days. Take your time — we don't want to hurt civilians,'"" Bennett said.
""And the war would have continued into 1946, 1947. The best way to save lives is to accelerate the war, beat Hamas and this whole nightmare will be over.""

Nearly two-thirds of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of Israel-Hamas war: Poll


Nearly two-thirds of Americans say they disapprove of President Biden's handling of Israel's ongoing war against Hamas, according to an Associated Press poll released Wednesday.
While Americans overwhelmingly support Israel's war against Hamas, they showed less support for the U.S. providing military aid to Israel in the conflict. Roughly 56% of Americans say Israel's response to Hamas Oct. 7 massacre is about right or has not gone far enough, the poll found.
Meanwhile, only a third of Americans approve of how Biden has responded to the conflict, with 63% saying they disapprove, a figure that mirrors his approval rating more generally.

The AP poll of 1,239 adults was conducted Nov. 2-6, 2023, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, designed to represent the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.

15,000 Gazans flee south in a single day as Israel cracks down on Hamas in Gaza city

The United Nations estimates that some 15,000 people fled south from northern Gaza on Tuesday as Israel continued its campaign against Hamas terrorists in Gaza city.
Footage circulating on social media appeared to show a convoy of thousands of Gazans waving white flags as they moved south, flanked by Israeli armored vehicles. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says the Gazans used Israel's 4-hour window set up for evacuation.
Israeli forces
 are locked in combat with Hamas terrorists embedded in hundreds of miles of tunnels beneath Gaza City. Israeli officials said earlier this week that they believe many of the hostages Hamas took on Oct. 7 are being held under the city as well.
Those fleeing included children, older people and people with disabilities, and most walked with minimal belongings, the U.N. agency said. Some say they had to cross Israeli checkpoints, where they saw people being arrested, while others held their hands in the air and raised white flags while passing Israeli tanks.

Israel releases video of fiery attack on Hezbollah 'terrorist target'

Israel’s military has shared a video purportedly showing a fiery attack on a Hezbollah ""terrorist target.""
The Israeli Air Force wrote on X that the attack happened overnight, with footage depicting a fireball emerging following an airstrike.
Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, has been engaging in border skirmishes with Israeli forces as military activity is heating up against Hamas inside the Gaza Strip.
The Air Force released the video as it continues its ground operation in Gaza, announcing early this morning that Mohsen Abu Zina – whom it described as the Hamas' ""Head of Weapons and Industries"" -- is the group's latest top official to be taken out. 
""He served as one of Hamas’ leading weapon developers, with expertise in strategic weapons and rockets,"" the IDF said. 

And for the third day in a row, Israel’s military has opened an evacuation route within northern Gaza for residents there to head south.


""The northern Gaza Strip area is considered a fierce combat zone, and time is running out to evacuate it,"" IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee wrote on X. ""They join hundreds of thousands who have responded to calls and moved south in recent days."" 

Israel adopts law banning viewership of terrorist content

Israeli lawmakers passed new legislation making it illegal to view terrorist content under certain circumstances on Wednesday.

The new law, which has significant carveouts allowing for legitimate viewing of such content, carries a penalty of up to one year in prison. The law is primarily designed to prevent lone-wolf attackers from consuming pro-Hamas or Islamic State content, according to the Times of Israel.

Karine Jean-Pierre skewered online for refusing to condemn vandalism of hostage Israeli posters

White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre faced condemnation online after an initially hesitant response to a question about activists removing posters of hostages taken by Hamas terrorists.
Numerous videos have gone viral of activists tearing down posters showing hostages that were taken in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack that killed 1,400 in southern Israel.

A reporter noted to Jean-Pierre on Tuesday that there have been widely shared videos of individuals ""tearing down signs"" of Israelis currently being held hostage by Hamas terrorists in Gaza. He proceeded to ask whether it is the White House’s view that ""these actions should be condemned"" or if the White House sees such activity as a ""form of peaceful protest.""
""I've sorta kinda seen the reporting,"" Jean-Pierre said. She went on to block further questioning from the reporter and declared, ""I'm just not going to go into specifics on that particular thing.""
""What I can say is there are real violent protests and threats that are happening right now and senior administration officials are aware of these reports which are deeply concerning and that is something that we’re focused on,"" she added.
This sparked a wave of backlash across social media.

Biden amassing warships but failing to act to actually deter Iran, Hamas: Former NSC official

President Biden's deployment of carrier strike groups to the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean might be a show of force, but his actions to deter 40 Iranian-backed attacks on U.S. forces amid the Hamas invasion of Israel raise questions, a former National Security Council official told FOX News.
Richard Goldberg, who served in the Trump administration and is now a senior adviser at Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the White House is not sending any message of deterrence amid its warship rearrangements.
He responded to comments from NSC spokesman John Kirby, who told reporters the administration is sending a strong signal of deterrence and ""that there have been additional attacks on our troops doesn't necessarily mean that the war is widening.""
Goldberg told ""The Ingraham Angle""
 on Tuesday that he disagreed with Kirby, positing that Biden is instead sending ""messages of appeasement"" as they continue to seek a nuclear deal with Tehran and apparently refuse to renege on the recent unfreezing of Iranian assets in South Korean bank accounts.
The administration has said those funds are earmarked for and can only be used toward humanitarian means.

The G7 meeting comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening with Israel’s continued ground invasion forcing thousands of Palestinians to flee south on foot, running out of food and water in the north.
The ministers condemned ""the rise in extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians,"" which they said is ""unacceptable, undermines security in the West Bank, and threatens prospects for a lasting peace.""

They also noted that the G7 is ""working intensively to prevent the conflict from escalating further and spreading more widely.""

Israel kills top Hamas weapons developer: IDF

Israeli Defense Forces say they eliminated a senior Hamas commander in charge of the terrorist organization's weapons and industries programs on Wednesday.
The IDF says it killed Mohsen Abu Zina in recent fighting, but it did not clarify whether he was killed in an airstrike or a ground operation. Israel is currently operating deep within Gaza City, working to clear out Hamas' labyrinth of tunnels underground.

""The IDF and ISA eliminated Hamas’ Head of Weapons and Industries, Mohsen Abu Zina,"" the IDF wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. ""He served as one of Hamas’ leading weapon developers, with expertise in strategic weapons and rockets. We continue to operate in Gaza to eliminate Hamas.""




Jewish Americans are taking drastic measures to protect themselves and their loved ones, with many turning to firearms for the first time amid an alarming surge in antisemitism nationwide.
Florida gun store owner David Kowalsky addressed the growing number of Jews seeking to buy firearms and train with guns during ""America's Newsroom"" as many fear for their safety as war rages between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East.

""I have a lot of people coming in saying that they've never thought they'd be in this position where they had to purchase own or train with a firearm,"" Kowalsky told Dana Perino Tuesday. ""And they're coming in and wanting more information on how to obtain one train with one and to be able to protect their family and loved ones.""
Kowalsky said he has known people who have received direct threats since the war began one month ago following Hamas' unprecedented massacre on the Israeli people.
""Aside from neighborhoods being vandalized, synagogues, areas… saying they want to kill Jews and direct threats, they are very conscientious, very worried about what is going on around them and around the country in general.,"" Kowalsky said.

Israel’s UN ambassador slams Soros for donations to pro-Hamas groups seeking destruction of Jewish state,2023-12-03,Fox News,['Benjamin Weinthal'],"The X owner told Joe Rogan George Soros is doing things that ‘erode the fabric of civilization’
Left-wing activist billionaire George Soros is facing intense criticism from Israel’s ambassador to the U.N. for pumping over $15 million into a network of nongovernmental organizations that allegedly support Hamas. 
""George Soros’ donations to organizations that seek the destruction of the State of Israel as a Jewish state is shameful. However, I am not surprised,"" Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan told Fox News Digital.
Hamas launched a full-blown invasion into southern Israel Oct. 7, resulting in the mass murder of 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans. Hamas also took more than 200 hostages. American citizens were among civilians kidnapped by the jihadi terrorist entity.
""For years, Soros has backed and transferred money to organizations supporting BDS that want to isolate Israel,"" added Erdan, who has been leading the diplomatic campaign at the U.N. to spell out Hamas’ crimes against humanity. ""They have never been about real peace or any solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""

BDS is an abbreviation for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign targeting the Jewish state. The German and Austrian parliaments classified BDS as an antisemitic movement that resembles the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses during the nascent phase of the Holocaust.
Rachel Ehrenfeld, author of ""The Soros Agenda,"" told Fox News Digital, ""Support of pro-Hamas, pro-Palestinian groups in the U.S. is not limited to foreign entities. It also comes directly and indirectly from U.S.-based foundations. George and Alexander Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF) is one of them.""

""Soon after he settled in the White House, Biden appointed Robert Malley as his special envoy to Iran,"" Ehrenfeld wrote in her book. ""Malley is the former president and CEO of the Soros-funded, Brussels-based International Crisis Group, which, like Soros, has been criticizing Israel and praising Hamas. ""
The U.S. and the European Union have designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organization. A number of recent probes claimed to show OSF funneled significant funds into virulently anti-Israel NGOs that are allegedly pro-Hamas.

The New York Post noted last month that Soros has funneled over $15 million to groups who are anti-Israel and carry water for Hamas’ agenda.

When pressed in a number of Fox News Digital press queries if Soros’ philanthropic empire, OSF, considers Hamas a terrorist organization, a spokeperson for the OSF based in London refused to answer.
The OSF spokesperson, however, said the ""Open Society Foundations utterly condemn the brutal attacks on Israeli citizens on Oct. 7. We grieve for the lives lost and injured and those taken hostage and their families. Like so many others around the world today we also feel the same pain for the Palestinian citizens whose lives are now being lost in tragically mounting numbers because of the conflict.""

The OSF spokesperson added,  ""There must be accountability for the war crimes and breaches of humanitarian law that have occurred.""
When asked about the accusations that OSF funds pro-Hamas NGOs, the OSF spokesperson noted, ""Any of our grantees have different perspectives and routinely disagree with each other, but our funding strategy, which has evolved over 20 years, is targeted towards working towards a secure future where rights and freedoms are respected. There is strict U.S. anti-terrorist legislation that determines which organizations a foundation like OSF can fund. We devote a lot of effort to ensuring full compliance.""

In 2007, Soros wrote an opinion article for the Financial Times in which he slammed the U.S. and Israeli governments for not recognizing Hamas as the legitimate government of the Gaza Strip. 
OSF has also funded two progressive NGOs called Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and IfNotNow. On the day Hamas massacred 1,200 people, JVP issued a statement that  ""the source of all this violence"" was ""Israeli apartheid and occupation — and United States complicity in that oppression.""
WITNESS TO TERRORISM: HOW HAMAS RADICALIZED PALESTINIANS FOR THEIR GENOCIDAL ATTACK ON ISRAEL

The names of the Jewish NGOs are misleading, mainstream experts on antisemitism argue. The Jewish NGO Anti-Defamation League wrote that ""Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) is a radical anti-Israel and anti-Zionist activist group that advocates for the boycott of Israel and eradication of Zionism.""
Zionism is the founding philosophy of the Jewish state.
The ADL added, ""JVP does not represent the mainstream Jewish community, which it views as bigoted for its association with Israel.""  OSF has pumped at least $650,000 into the JVP’s coffers since 2017.

According to the ADL, the Detroit chapter of IfNotNow circulated a flier that showed an image of a paraglider, a clear reference to the Hamas terrorists who invaded Israel as part of their aerial campaign to wipe out Jews. IfNotNow is one of the principal organizers of the U.S.-based campaign against Israel since Oct. 7, noted the ADL. According to reports, IfNotNow received $400,000 from Soros’ OSF. 
JVP, which was founded in California, supported the Hamas-animated ""Great Return March"" in 2018, a precursor to Oct. 7, which was a series of attempts by Palestinians in Gaza to invade Israel by breaching its security border barrier.
OSF provides funds to obscure Jewish NGOs whose mission is to exploit their Jewish identity to turn the bashing of Israel (and support for terrorism) into a politically and socially correct campaign, according to critics like Joshua Muravchik.
Writing in the Jewish magazine Commentary, he noted, ""Deploying its ‘Jewish’ identity in attacking Israel is JVP’s métier, one might say its purpose. The cutting edge of this work, as the episode of SJP’s tweets illustrates, is to deflect accusations of antisemitism.""

The first plane carrying U.S. ammunition landed in Israel Tuesday evening, Israeli officials said, as the country amassed tanks near the Gaza border ahead of an expected ground operation.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the armaments, which arrived at the Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel, ""are designed to facilitate significant military operations and increase preparedness for other scenarios.""
The IDF did not disclose what types of weapons or military equipment it received. This equipment was brought to Israel through a joint operation overseen by the Ministry of Defense's Directorate of Production and Procurement, the U.S. Procurement Mission and the International Transportation Unit within Israel's Ministry of Defense.

""We must be crystal clear: We stand with Israel,"" Biden said. ""We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself and respond to this attack.""
The president added, ""There’s no justification for terrorism. There’s no excuse. Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination.""

Pro-Palestinian groups originally planned to protest at Federal Plaza, but moved to Skokie upon learning of the Israeli solidarity event, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. U.S. Palestinian Community Network National Chair Hatem Abudayyeh said the group moved the protest because the Jewish groups ""must be confronted as the racist apologists for Israel that they are,"" the report said.

Tlaib also accused the Biden administration of funding a ""genocide"" against Palestinians as she wept while speaking to the crowd of protesters calling for a ceasefire in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.
""That's what's been really painful — just continue to watch people think it's okay to bomb a hospital where children. You know, what's so hard sometimes is watching those videos and the people telling the kids, 'Don't cry.' But like, let them cry!

Still intermittently crying, she went on to tell the protesters they were ""on the right side of history.""
Tlaib first repeated Hamas' claim that Israel bombed the hospital in a Tuesday post on X after news of the explosion broke. Hamas has continued to push the narrative despite video evidence and an assessment from the U.S. National Security Council that a terrorist group's own rockets caused the reported damage and deaths.

A spokesperson from IDF said in a tweet on Israel's main X account just hours later that the Christian hospital in Gaza was destroyed by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket amid their barrage, not an Israeli missile.
Additionally, Fox News Digital found that a progressive consultant acting as a top fundraiser for Tlaib recently said she believed Israel intended to ethnically cleanse Palestinians, which came after she consistently projected anti-Israel viewpoints on social media.

""I was in my tent and thought it was fireworks, but when I went outside, I saw chaos, hundreds of people were running towards me, to the parking lot behind me,"" she recalled to Fox News Digital on Friday. ""We started gathering our things and headed towards the car.""  
But the group, who included Ben Artzi’s best friend, Norelle, did not make it much past the parking area, because the traffic had come to a standstill. Jumping out of their cars, they ran for cover in a nearby bomb shelter, a small concrete structure with one entrance and no windows, which is used for protection in open spaces.  
""At first, we were near the entrance, but then around 25 or 30 people crammed into this tiny space and people at the back were starting to suffocate,"" Ben Artzi said. She agreed to switch places with people further back, and when one of her friends started having a panic attack, Noa suggested they sit down on the floor, where there was more air. When another woman also began hyperventilating, Noa suggested she join them, too. 
""I hugged her and asked her name, she said it was Michele,"" Ben Artzi recounted. ""We sat like that for about 25 minutes, and the next thing I heard was people saying, ‘They’re coming, they’re coming.’""

Ben Artzi does not remember what happened next only that shots rang out, and a grenade was thrown into the shelter. She woke up to find herself buried under a mass of lifeless bodies.

""At that point, I was on my back with three or four bodies on top of me. One of the bodies, lying across my stomach, was really heavy, his head was on my throat,"" she said. ""My head was on someone else’s chest, and then I realized that it was Michele – she was still alive.""  
Over the next three hours, the two women lay together in the dark with dead bodies pinning them down as the Hamas terrorists continued firing rounds of ammunition into the shelter, throwing in grenades, and even lighting a fire outside. As smoke poured inside, the new friends whispered to one another to boost morale.  
Then they heard Hebrew voices outside and water being thrown onto the fire. The flashlight of a police officer shone inside the shelter, and Ben Artzi tried to draw attention but was too far under the bodies.

""The police officer kept going in and out, because there was no air in there, it was filled with smoke,"" she said. ""I tried to move the bodies, but every time my hand went inside them because parts of them were blown away."" 
Finally, police officers found Ben Artzi, lifted the dead bodies off her, and dragged her outside.  
""I couldn’t stand because there was no blood circulation in my legs, and I could not breathe because of the smoke,"" she said.  
""I found out later that Michele had been shot in the back, but we did not realize it while were there. Thank God, she is still alive,"" said Artzi. ""It’s a total miracle.""  
NEW JERSEY WOMAN'S 'ONLY SON,' ASPIRING DJ, DEAD AFTER HAMAS ATTACKED ISRAELI DANCE PARTY
She was notified late on Friday, however, that her best friend, Norelle, had been found among the dead.  
When Yonatan Ben Reim heard the Iron Dome rocket defense system spring into action near his home on Saturday morning, he thought something did not sound right.  
""It was shooting like a machine gun, because there were so many rockets,"" Ben Reim, a retired police officer who lives in the community of Prigan near the Gaza border, said. ""I told my son, Yuval, ‘Listen, if they are shooting like this into the sky, then they don’t want us to look at the ground.’"" 
A few minutes later, Ben Reim heard gunshots, and something did not feel right. ""I told Yuval, ‘Listen what we are hearing are not Israeli guns, they are Arab guns,’"" he recounted to Fox News Digital. ""I told Yuval to gather everyone into the bomb shelter, and I waited in the living room.""

A little while later, Ben Reim heard people outside speaking Arabic. Aiming his revolver at them, he started firing. Then, he said, ""All hell broke loose . . . it was like a Hollywood movie.""  
""There were eight terrorists outside, and I just ran for the shelter and closed the door just as they entered my house,"" he said. ""They were calling out in Arabic, ""Put your hands up, it’s the police.""  
Ben Reim recounted how the terrorists moved from room to room, throwing grenades and firing from AK47 rifles. He handed Yuval, 22, another handgun and told him to stand by the window while he covered the door.  
""We could not seal it up perfectly, and they started shooting at us through the window. We shot back at them with 150 rounds and then started praying,"" he said.

The family, Ben Reim, Yuval, his wife, his other two sons, and a young daughter stayed inside the shelter for more than two hours while the terrorists went through his neighbors' homes trying to convince the residents to show themselves, threatening to burn down the houses and shooting through the windows.  
""I told my family that we would not surrender, that it would be better to die than be a prisoner in Gaza,"" said Ben Reim, who eventually managed to contact the local civilian security force, who arrived and confronted the terrorists, taking them out. Two members of that civilian force were killed in the gunfight.  
Ben Reim said that he acted like a robot throughout the ordeal, while the rest of his family quietly followed his directions.  
""We all spoke in whispers and were very calm, even though we did not think that we would get out alive,"" he said.  
Yonit Kedar, 42, said that she is still in shock that she managed to survive the attack at the Nova Festival.

""I had no idea that we had escaped a massacre until later that evening,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Even when I was in the car driving and saw people running through the fields, I did not realize that we were running for our lives.""  
OUR AMERICAN-ISRAELI 21-YEAR-OLD SON WAS MURDERED IN THE HAMAS ATTACKS. THIS IS WHAT WE WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW
The site of hundreds of partygoers, some running barefoot, is something that will stay with her for a long time, said Kedar. ""My grandmother is a Holocaust survivor, so it was really triggering, but I am glad that I did not see anything worse than that.""  
In fact, Kedar’s story is borderline surreal. The 42-year-old mother of two said she had no idea that terrorists had infiltrated into Israel, even as she and her friends fled the party as rockets flew overhead. 
""My story is quite calm and collected,"" she recounted. ""I have two young children, and I could not see any possibility of me not getting home. That did not even compute in my mind.""  
Kedar describes how she and her friends, also mothers of young children, were the first to pack up their belongings and leave the festival, but after becoming stuck in a line of cars, they jumped out and hid under a bridge as the rocket fire continued.  
""We did not see or hear the gunshots. We were sure that the only danger was coming from the sky,"" she recounted. ""We did not know that the traffic jam was caused by the fact there were terrorists shooting people dead in their cars.""  
While Kedar’s group was hiding under the bridge, the terrorists unwittingly passed them. When she and her friends ran back to their car, where they were told to drive eastward, over the nearby fields.  
""My car is not a jeep or even a 4x4. It is not meant to go over fields, but I just kept on driving, driving, driving and keeping my head forward,"" she said.  
It was then that she began to hear the gunshots.  
""We were surrounded by people on foot, and we told them to get in the car,"" she said, describing how a group of 20-year-olds just jumped inside. ""They were panting and screaming. Many people were on drugs or psychedelics, and it was just horrific hearing them cry.""

At one point, Kedar said, she was driving with the doors open and people were just jumping in and out. Eventually, she arrived at a road, and out of nowhere, she said, there was a soldier driving with his tires blown out. He told them to head to a nearby military base.  
With eight people now inside her car, Kedar made for the base, even as gunshots rained down behind her. She stayed on the base for a few hours and then headed back home to Tel Aviv. It was only in the evening that she realized the extent of what had happened in southern Israel last Saturday.  
""I just really can’t believe that we survived,"" Kedar said.

DeSantis says US shouldn’t take in refugees from Gaza: ‘I am not going to do that’,2023-10-14,Fox News,['Adam Shaw'],"Israeli geopolitical tour guide Ilan Shulman tells ‘FOX News Live’ that no matter where people are located in Israel, they feel threatened.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says the U.S. should not be receiving any refugees from Gaza in light of the Hamas terror attack against Israel, after at least one left-wing Democrat suggested it.
""I will say, and I don’t know what Biden’s going to do, but we cannot accept people from Gaza into this country as refugees,"" DeSantis, who is running for the Republican 2024 presidential nomination, said on Saturday. ""I am not going to do that.""
DeSantis was speaking a week after the Hamas terror attack against Israel that killed over 1,300 Israelis. Israel has since launched a counterattack against Hamas in Gaza, sparking a significant displacement of the population. The United Nations has said that more than 423,000 Gaza citizens have been displaced. 
UN REFUGEE AGENCY: GAZA BECOMING A ‘HELLHOLE’ ON THE ‘BRINK OF COLLAPSE’

The U.S., under the Biden administration, has expanded refugee resettlement from a cap of 18,000 during the Trump administration to 125,000 now — although it did not come close to reaching that cap last year. Of the FY 2024 allocation, 30,000-45,000 is allocated for refugees from the Near East and South Asia.
The humanitarian situation has led to some concerns from Republicans that refugees from Gaza could end up in the United States. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-NY, told the New York Post the U.S. should be open to accepting refugees from the area.
""Fifty percent of the population in Gaza are children. The international community as well as the United States should be prepared to welcome refugees from Palestine while being very careful to vet and not allow members of Hamas,"" he told the outlet.
An administration official told Fox News Digital this week that the U.S. ""supports safe passage for civilians"" and provides support to Palestinian refugees through support to the U.N, including the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) while also engaging in a ""worldwide refugee resettlement program"" in partnership with the U.N.
HAMAS TERROR ATTACK FUELS CONSERVATIVE CONCERNS ABOUT BORDER SECURITY AMID MIGRANT CRISIS 
But DeSantis cited anti-Israeli views from the area as a reason they shouldn’t be allowed into the U.S.
""If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they’re all anti-Semitic, none of them believe in Israel’s right to exist, none of the Arab states are willing to take any of them,"" he said. ""The Arab states should be taking them if you have refugees, you don’t fly people and import them into the United States of America.""

He also noted the pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel protests that have taken place in the U.S., as well as in other Western countries.
""My view is very simple: If you don't like this country, if you hate America, you should not come to this country, we’ve got to start being smart about this.""

Israel constructs large pumps to flood Hamas terror tunnels with seawater: Wall Street Journal,2023-12-05,Fox News,['Chris Pandolfo'],"FOX News' Greg Palkot reports the latest on the Israel-Hamas war.
The Israeli military has assembled several large pumps it could use to flood the Hamas tunnels beneath the Gaza Strip with seawater, driving out terrorists hiding there, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing U.S. officials.
Construction of five large seawater pumps was completed in November about one mile north of the Al-Shati refugee camp. Each pump is capable of drawing water from the Mediterranean Sea and can move thousands of cubic meters of water per hour, which would flood the tunnels within weeks, the report said.
Israel has not yet committed to the plan, and it is unclear whether it would attempt to flood the tunnels while there are still hostages, including Americans, held by Hamas. The Palestinian terror group took some 240 people captive during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and brought them back to the Gaza Strip. 
According to the report, Israel has identified about 800 tunnels beneath Gaza that Hamas has used to move fighters, store weapons and plan terror attacks on Israel. However, Israeli officials believe the tunnel network is much larger.

By flooding the tunnels over several weeks, Israel would enable Hamas terrorists and potentially hostages to move out, the outlet reported, citing a source familiar with the plan. 
""We are not sure how successful pumping will be since nobody knows the details of the tunnels and the ground around them,"" the source said. ""It’s impossible to know if that will be effective because we don’t know how seawater will drain in tunnels no one has been in before.""

The Wall Street Journal said an Israel Defense Forces official declined to comment on the flooding plan, but said: ""The IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas’s terror capabilities in various ways, using different military and technological tools.""
U.S. officials were informed of the plan last month, the Wall Street Journal reported, but the U.S. does not know how close Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is to executing the plan.

Israel has committed to continuing its war effort until Hamas is eradicated in Gaza. The Israeli military said it launched its 10,000th airstrike against the terror group in the Gaza Strip late Sunday.
Israel has vowed to do everything it can to protect civilians as it targets Hamas and its network of tunnels. Many of the 10,000 airstrikes have been aimed at destroying Hamas' underground labyrinth.

The IDF says it has struck over 400 separate Hamas targets since the cease-fire agreement collapsed on Friday. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday that Hamas was to blame for the end of the cease-fire, because they did not release ""additional women and children that we know that they are holding, and they're refusing to let go.""
""Our policy is clear — we will forcefully strike any threat posed against our territory,"" IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a statement.

"More than a million Palestinians in Gaza are now displaced, why are Arab countries not opening their doors?",2023-11-19,Fox News,['Ruth Marks Eglash'],"Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of a Hamas founding leader, joined 'FOX & Friends' to discuss why it is necessary for the U.S. to pressure Egypt to open the border crossing and the latest on the Israel-Hamas war. 
JERUSALEM — At a summit of leaders from more than 50 Arab and Muslim states held last weekend in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Israel’s military response in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre was fiercely condemned. 
But what was missing from the gathering’s final statement was any immediate solution for the 2.3 million civilians of the Palestinian enclave, more than half of whom are now internally displaced after nearly six weeks of fighting.
While the final resolution called for an immediate end to ""the brutal Israeli aggression on Gaza"" and made offers of humanitarian and financial aid to the Palestinians, not one country came forward with a viable solution, even temporarily, for the 1.5 million civilians who, according to the latest U.N. figures, are now internally displaced in the southern section of the Strip. 
As the death toll in Gaza rises, thousands of civilians continue to flee the conflict and head southward, where the Israeli military has said it is safer and where truckloads of food, water, and medicine arrive daily via the Rafah Crossing with Egypt. The U.N. estimates 250,000 fled in the past week alone.

Some have questioned why nearby Arab countries, who have provided temporary shelter in the past to civilians from other regional conflicts, appear unwilling to even discuss sheltering the refugees from Gaza.
""Arab states have historically been divided with regard to their stance on the Palestinian people and numerous other significant issues,"" Ahed Al-Hindi, a senior fellow at the Center for Peace Communications, told Fox News Digital. ""Although these states project solidarity with the Palestinian people, they hold divergent views on the most effective course of action.""
""Certain countries, including those in the Arab Gulf, Jordan, Morocco and Egypt advocate for a two-state solution, which they believe can be accomplished through diplomacy. Conversely, the Iranian axis espouses the ideology of obliterating Israel and establishing a Palestinian state extending from the river to the sea.""
Al-Hindi said the primary reason why even the moderate states, most of which have diplomatic ties with Israel, have not taken practical steps to help the civilian population in Gaza is due to their aversion to Hamas and its goals.""
""As a result, many Arab countries are concerned that aiding the Gazans could inadvertently benefit Hamas, given that the organization has ruled in Gaza for nearly a generation,"" he said. ""Hamas is a network affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Muslim Brotherhood opposes every Arab monarch. This poses significant internal risks to the aforementioned states.""

GAZA RESIDENTS SPEAK OF HAMAS’ BRUTALITY AMID DESIRES FOR PEACE IN THE REGION
""Ideologies of the Muslim Brotherhood advocate for the overthrow of Arab monarchies and the formation of a Sunni revolutionary Islamic republic, which would resemble Iran but operate under the banner of Sunni jihadism,"" Al-Hindi added. ""Since Hamas serves as an agent for Iran, which in turn presents an additional danger to Arab monarchs, the majority of these nations are worried that their assistance to Gaza may fall into the clutches of Hamas.""
The two Arab countries bordering Israel on either side — Egypt and Jordan — have both pointedly refused to offer refuge to any number of Palestinians from Gaza, even though Jordan already has a large Palestinian population and Egypt’s expansive and sparsely populated Sinai Peninsula is just a few miles from where the thousands of Palestinians are now being cared for by international aid agencies.
Earlier this month, Egypt’s Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly dismissed calls for displaced Palestinians to resettle in the Sinai desert, saying his country would protect its land and sovereignty at any cost. His comments came following the revelation of an Israeli intelligence document proposing that residents of the Strip be evacuated to tent cities in Sinai as the Israeli military works to destroy Hamas.

""We are ready to sacrifice millions of lives to protect our territory from any encroachment,"" Madbouly said in a recent speech, advocating that a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians was the only comprehensive resolution that would guarantee regional peace.
Hussain Abdul-Hussain, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that such a solution should have been touted by the international community at the onset of the war.
""Washington should have made the humanitarian argument, helped fund a camp for Gaza refugees in Sinai and guaranteed their return after the end of the war,"" he said. ""This would have convinced Egyptians to take them.""

Still, said Abdul-Hussain, both Jordan and Egypt also have their own domestic concerns driving their refusal to offer refuge to Palestinians now displaced due to the fighting. 
""Jordan is not an option,"" he said, adding that it does not border Gaza, and logistically it is not feasible to move hundreds of thousands of Gazans there. 
Egypt’s resistance, Abdul-Hussain said, stems from President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi's view of Hamas, a Palestinian off-shoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Egyptian leader has been fighting since he came to power.

""Transplanting Gazans, with thousands of possible Hamas cadres or partisans, into his Sinai, where he battled ISIS, might scare the Egyptians a bit,"" he explained. Hussain also pointed out that even if Egypt did want to take in the Gazan refugees, the country’s financial instability made it impossible.
While the practical arguments presented by these two Arab countries are plausible, there is also a deeper, ideological and even emotional reason rooted in the region’s history, mostly dating back to Israel’s creation in 1948. In fact, many of the images coming out of Gaza in recent days, with columns of shabbily dressed and clearly shaken civilians trekking miles on foot to reach safety in the south, have been compared to what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or ""catastrophe,"" when an estimated 700,000 Palestinians chose to leave their homes or were forced to flee to neighboring countries during Israel’s war for independence. 
""The Arab world, particularly countries like Egypt and Jordan, have found themselves in a very uncomfortable situation,"" said Michael Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst and head of intelligence at Leo Beck International. ""They need to show support for Palestinians in Gaza because a large majority of the Arab public sympathizes with the Palestinian cause. But there is not much they can do beyond token statements of support and limited aid.""
Horowitz said the notion of Egypt or Jordan hosting Palestinian refugees was a ""non-starter.""
""Doing so would actually anger the pro-Palestinian segments of their population, who would feel that they are actively facilitating a ""second Nakba,"" he said, adding that such a move would be so unpopular among the public it could even destabilize some of those countries.

""Arab states feel they should not be held responsible for Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, which to them stands at the origin of much that ails the region,"" said Joost Hilterman, program director for the Middle East and North Africa at the International Crisis Group. ""To them, Israel, as the occupying power, has absolute responsibility for the welfare of the Palestinian population."" 
Hilterman also noted that the Palestinians ""do not want to leave Palestine and become refugees again, and both Egypt and the Palestinian population of Gaza fear that the temporary will become permanent, especially if Israel renders Gaza uninhabitable, which it is well on its way in doing.""

LeBron James gets backlash after speaking out on ‘tragic and unacceptable’ war in Israel,2023-10-12,Fox News,['Ryan Morik'],"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The war in Israel has grabbed the attention of everybody, including arguably the most popular athlete on planet Earth.
LeBron James posted a joint statement with Maverick Carter through SpringHill Company, their entertainment development and production company they founded in 2020.
In the statement that was posted on Instagram on Wednesday night, they described ""the devastation in Israel"" as ""tragic and unacceptable.""

""The murder and violence against innocent people by Hamas is terrorism,"" James and Carter said. ""The SpringHill Company family extends our deepest condolences to Israel and the Jewish community. We pray for peace in the region and reiterate our continued commitment to fight hate in all its forms. We all must work to ensure this tragedy does not spread even more hate, racism, and antisemitism.""
A number of people who commented on James' post, though, reacted negatively to the sentiment.
""What about the kids on the Gaza strip that wear your jersey, play ball because of you and look up to you?"" one use commented on the post. ""Aren't they not children being oppressed and murdered too?""
""Delete this pals,"" another said.
""come on man don’t be one eyed about the situation,go do your research brother,"" wrote one other.
A Los Angeles Lakers fan account, the team James plays for, even disagreed with the all-time points scorer.
""You may not be with Palestine but Allah will always be, we will not back down until we are finally free #FreePalestine,"" the account wrote.
Carter and James played both basketball and football together at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio, and Carter has served as James' business manager since 2006.

DeSantis touts Israel evacuation effort as Florida ‘fills the void’ with Americans landing in Tampa,2023-10-17,Fox News,['Charles Creitz'],"FOX News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on how 2024 Republican presidential candidates are responding to the war in Israel on ‘FOX News Live.’
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis touted an evacuation operation his administration supported that led to nearly 300 American citizens evacuated from Tel Aviv, Israel, who landed Monday at Tampa International Airport.
DeSantis, a 2024 presidential candidate, told FOX News he saw a lack of actionable leadership on the part of the Biden administration and decided to see what Tallahassee could do to execute what he claimed Washington could not.
""It was sad because the State Department and the embassy over in Israel were not helpful to these people. If you think about it, illegal aliens come across our southern border and the federal government will fly them all over the country for free,"" he said, noting how illegal immigrants also get taxpayer-funded hotel stays and other perks the average citizen could never attain.
DeSantis said he was instead seeing that Americans stuck in Israel were offered options like ""dump[ing] them in Cyprus"" – an island in the Mediterranean Sea.

""So we did an executive order at the end of last week, and said, 'we'll mobilize our emergency response folks – we'll get planes there to bring Floridians back home from Israel. And so we were able to land the first plane last night…"" DeSantis told ""Hannity.""
DeSantis said he and First Lady Casey DeSantis were on hand in Tampa to welcome the Americans home. A local FOX report said about one-third of those onboard were Floridians.
""I had a woman come up to me saying her six-year-old daughter was saying, 'I don't want to hear any more rockets. I want to go back to Florida,'"" he said.
REP. MILLS FLIES TO ISRAEL TO HELP RESCUE AMERICANS: DOING JOB ‘BIDEN FAILED AT TWICE’
""So we were able to fill the void. There was no leadership. And so we stepped up and we led.""
According to that FOX-13 report, the DeSantis administration supported a Hillsborough County nonprofit called Project Dynamo, the co-founder of which told the outlet his team headed to Israel shortly after Hamas attacked civilians there.

On the federal level, Secretary of State Tony Blinken traveled to Israel, where he announced late Monday that President Biden will visit in a show of solidarity. The secretary's announcement came from overseas at what would be about 3 a.m. Tuesday Jerusalem time.
Biden has warned Israel not to take over or occupy Gaza, but also appeared to cryptically warn Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah political-militant group, ""don't,"" in an interview with CBS News on Sunday.
For his part, DeSantis told FOX News that Biden has been a failure when it comes to confronting Iran, saying he has been playing diplomatic ""footsie"" with the Raisi regime.
""Stop doing that and understand that Iran wants to fund terrorism,"" he said, while further adding America's role should indeed be supporting Israel and its ""right to get the job done"" in ""eliminat[ing] Hamas.""

Republicans blast Biden for releasing $6 billion in frozen Iran funds ahead of Hamas attack on Israel,2023-10-07,Fox News,['Adam Shaw'],"Fox & Friends Weekend co-host Pete Hegseth discusses attacks on Israel by militants. 
Republicans in the House and Senate are tearing into the Biden administration for unfreezing $6 billion in Iranian assets months before Hamas terrorists launched a deadly and massive attack on Israel early Saturday – criticism that the Biden administration called ""false and misleading.""
""Just weeks ago, the Biden administration handed over $6 billion to Iran, and today, innocent Israelis were murdered by Iran-backed terrorists,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in a statement. ""We must continue to support our strongest ally in the Middle East and their right to defend themselves against these unprovoked, horrific attacks.""
Blackburn spoke after Hamas terrorists invaded areas of southern Israel. Thousands of rockets were fired into Israel and dozens of fighters infiltrated through the border. Local Israeli media reported that at least 100 people have been killed in the assault.
AT LEAST 100 DEAD AS HAMAS LAUNCHES UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON ISRAEL, NETANYAHU SAYS NATION IS ‘AT WAR’ 
WASHINGTON - APRIL 19: Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., questions Internal Revenue Service Commisioner Daniel Werfel during the Senate Finance Committee hearing on ""The Presidents Fiscal Year 2024 IRS Budget and the IRSs 2023 Filing Season"" on Wednesday, April 19, 2023. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel was ""at war"" and promised that the attackers would pay ""an unprecedented price."" The White House said that President Biden was briefed ""on the appalling Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel.""
But Republicans highlighted recent moves by the Biden administration to release $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds as part of a prisoner swap deal. The deal allows the transfer of the money held in a South Korean bank to accounts in Qatar. The administration says the money can only be used for humanitarian purposes and the U.S. will have oversight as to how and when the funds are used. There is no evidence that any of that $6 billion has left the Qatari account as of yet.
""Let's be clear: the deal to bring U.S. citizens home from Iran has nothing to do with the horrific attack on Israel. Not a penny has been spent, and when it is, it can only go for humanitarian needs like food and medicine. Anything to the contrary is false,"" State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter..
Separately, a State Dept. spokesperson said that the money in the accounts in Qatar ""remains in Doha.""
""Not a penny has been spent, and it will never go to Iran—it can only be used for future humanitarian-related purposes. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and misleading,"" they said.
But critics have argued that the money is fungible and could be diverted elsewhere. Iran is a known backer of Hamas and praised the Saturday attacks on Israel. The State Department has previously said that Iran provides some $100 million a year to Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

Republicans in both chambers highlighted the alleged link between the attacks and the funding being unfrozen by the Biden administration.
ISRAELI PM NETANYAHU DECLARES 'WAR AFTER HAMAS TERRORISTS LAUNCH MASSIVE ATTACK: LIVE UPDATES
""This is exactly why so many Americans & Israelis were DISGUSTED to see [President Biden] give the Iranian regime $6 billion last month,"" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said on X. ""Every dollar given to Iran funds terrorism in the Ayatollah’s quest to destroy Israel. Iran is behind today’s invasion & everyone must say that.""
In the House, Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., said that Biden ""just gave Hamas sponsor Iran $6 billion."" 
""Today, innocent Israeli citizens have paid with their lives for his and the Obama holdovers' venal incompetence,"" he said.
""This is a clear attack on Israel. We must fully #StandWithIsrael to defend itself & stand strong on the front lines of terrorism,"" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, posted. ""We must act quickly to help Israel & reverse the damage of Biden’s $6BB funding of an Iranian regime backing each of the groups likely involved.""
On the campaign trail, Sen. Tim Scott — who is running for the GOP 2024 White House nomination — said that the U.S. ""didn’t just invite this aggression, we paid for it.""
""Iran is the biggest funder of Hamas. This is the Biden $6 billion ransom payment at work,"" he said.

The White House also pushed back against the narrative by Republicans, with Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates calling it a ""shameful lie in every respect, at a time when both parties should be totally united in supporting Israel's defense.""
""Not a cent has been spent -They won't go to the Iranian govt -They can only be used for verifiable purchases of humanitarian needs like food & medicine,"" he posted on X.
National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson also rejected the connection between the unfrozen payments and the attacks. ""These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread disinformation,"" Watson posted on X.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Saturday that the U.S. ""unequivocally condemns the appalling attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israel, including civilians and civilian communities.""

""There is never any justification for terrorism. We stand in solidarity with the government and people of Israel, and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks. We will remain in close contact with our Israeli partners.

The Brooklyn demonstration marked three weeks since Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack against Israel on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, as 1,400 Israelis were murdered Oct. 7. Hamas's health ministry estimates that around 7,300 Palestinians have been killed since the war began.
Protestors were seen holding signs that read, ""By any means necessary"" and ""NYC stands with Gaza"" while waving Palestinian flags.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized Hamas supporters on Monday for overlooking the terrorist group's sex crimes against Israeli women.
Speaking at a United Nations meeting via remote video, Clinton called it ""outrageous"" to ignore the reports of sexual assaults.
""Organizations, governments and individuals who are committed to a better future for women and girls have a responsibility to condemn all violence against women,"" Clinton said. ""It is outrageous just that some who claim to stand for justice are closing their eyes and their hearts to the victims of Hamas.""
The former U.S. official noted that ""women on both sides of the current conflict in the Middle East have long worked for a just and lasting peace.""

""I have grieved with Israeli women who have lost loved ones to terrorist attacks, but refuse to believe that peace is impossible,"" Clinton continued. ""I have talked and listened to Palestinian women who have suffered greatly from the conflicts of the past decades, yet dream of a peaceful future and a state of their own.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused Monday to condemn comments from a top progressive lawmaker who called for ""balance"" when condemning Hamas' use of sexual violence against Israeli women.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said ""we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinian"" when asked specifically about mass rape committed by Palestinian militants, during an interview Sunday with CNN. When asked about Jayapal's comments, Jean-Pierre reiterated that using rape as a weapon of war was ""reprehensible,"" but stopped short of condemning the congresswoman.
""I can only speak for the president — that's who I can speak for,"" Jean-Pierre told Fox News correspondent Jacqui Heinrich
 during the daily White House press briefing Monday. ""We've been clear that what Hamas did is absolutely reprehensible, full stop. We're going to continue to be clear about that.""
""We think rape and the use of rape — being used as a weapon — that is also reprehensible and that's full stop and I'll just leave it there,"" she continued. ""That's speaking for the president of the United States and I think I've been very clear on that.""
After Jean-Pierre was pressed about Jayapal's comments in particular, she again declined to address the congresswoman's remarks directly.
""I just commented on it. I just laid out what we believe is unacceptable,"" she added.

A brand-new menorah stands high outside the Chabad House near San Diego State University, after the previous one had been vandalized three times in the last two years.
""This happened, and it was outside our control, but what we can control is showing that love always wins against hate,"" Chalom Boudjnah, Rabbi and Director of Chabad House at SDSU told Fox News Digital.

The latest act of vandalism against the menorah in March left the structure broken on the ground, and it was all caught on tape.
""It was done in a vicious act. You can see where one person, who covered himself up, went straight at the menorah, pushed it down to the breaking point. Really, really vile and hateful,"" Boudjnah described.
But despite the attack, Boudjnah said it ignited the passion in their spirit more and that's when they decided to rebuild the menorah — even with mounting hate crimes and acts of antisemitism happening across the country.
""It's been a burden on our community, but we are reminded that we have to stand strong. We didn't let this ruin anything. Instead, we came together and decided to build something beautiful and strong,"" Boudjnah said.

Pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian supporters clashed at a demonstration in New York City on Monday.

What appeared to be thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered to block the roadway of the Williamsburg Bridge to call for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.
One protestor wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh was seen shouting ""F--k the Jews!"" and waving a Palestinian flag.
A pro-Israel supporter was also heard chanting ""Israel lives!"" and waving a flag at a group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, prompting negative reactions.
Dozens of New York Police Department (NYPD) officers were observed at the scene.

EXCLUSIVE: Sheryl Sandberg told Fox News Digital that ""politics are blinding us to something that is completely obvious""—condemning Hamas for rape and other sexual violence committed against Jewish women on Oct. 7.

Sandberg, the founder of ""Lean In"" and former chief operating officer of Facebook, spoke to Fox News Digital on the sidelines of an event hosted by Israel at the United Nations headquarters on Monday.
The event, hosted by Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan, featured an address from Sandberg, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a video address by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and testimonials from Israeli police officers, and others about the brutality of Hamas’ attacks and to ""expose the horrors and shocking acts of sexual violence committed"" against women on Oct. 7.

A large gathering of pro-Palestinian protestors flooded the Williamsburg Bridge's roadways on Monday afternoon, as the Israel-Hamas war continues in the Middle East.
The demonstrators shouted phrases such as, ""New York did nada, long live the intifada,"" and, ""Five, six, seven, eight, Israel is a terror state,"" according to FOX 5 New York.
The group of protestors, which appeared to contain hundreds of people, began at 2:30 p.m., FOX 5 reported.
Protestors were also seen carrying a banner with the Arabic word intifada written, which means ""uprising.""


Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., responded to Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and other hard-left figures on Monday after she seemed unable to explain why there was a hesitation among some progressives to condemn Hamas' sexual violence against Israeli women. 
CNN's Dana Bash asked Torres why it was so difficult for progressives to ""unequivocally call out the barbaric sexual violence against Israeli women.""""Look, there’s often been a double standard against Israel when it comes to condemning the sheer butchery and barbarism of Hamas,"" Torres said.

""Public officials have a moral obligation to speak with clarity rather than caveats. And I found it deeply troubling, for example, that the UN Women, the so-called women’s rights arm of the United Nations, went 50 days without commenting on or condemning the sexual atrocities that Hamas perpetrated against Israeli women. For me, this is not about politics. This is about decency. It is indecent to deny or downplay or ‘both sides’ the rape and sexual violence against Israeli women on October 7.""

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that the U.S. believes Israel killed 'too many Palestinians' at the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war.

""I don't think it is a secret that we think that too many Palestinians were killed in the opening weeks of this conflict,"" Miller said at a briefing. ""We want to see Israel take additional steps to minimize civilian harm. We talked about them when we were in Israel last week.""
He added that the U.S. has been ""very transparent"" with Israel about its opinions on the fatalities, but that he does not believe Israel is purposefully targeting civilians.
""I have I have not seen evidence that they [Israel] are intentionally killing civilians,"" Miller explained. We believe that far too many civilians have been killed.""
""But again, this goes back to the underlying problem of this entire situation, which is that Hamas has embedded itself inside civilians, inside civilian homes, inside mosques, in schools, in churches,"" he continued. ""It is Hamas that is putting these civilians in harm's way.""

The U.S. State Department confirmed on Monday that 220 American citizens are still trapped in Gaza as the war between Israel and Hamas escalates.
Spokesperson Matthew Miller said that over 1,000 American citizens, legal permanent residents and family members of Americans have left Gaza since the war began.
""There are around 750 who are left,"" he explained. ""That includes 220 American citizens. The rest are family members or legal permanent residents.""
Miller also said that he could not confirm a report of an American dying in Gaza.

""Unfortunately, if the report is true, it's in northern Gaza where we have just [have] very limited information and very limited communications abilities and very limited ability to investigate or even reach people,"" he continued. ""So it's something that we're still trying to confirm at this point.""



An Israeli government spokesman, who went viral for his reaction to a question he was asked about the value of Palestinian versus Israeli lives in the hostage swap with Hamas, spoke with Fox News Digital about the uphill battle Israel has faced from much of the media following the October 7 terrorist attack. 
During an interview on Sky News, interviewer Kay Burley suggested to Eylon Levy that because Israel would get back 50 hostages taken by Hamas last month in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners in the agreed-upon temporary cease-fire deal, it placed less value on Palestinian lives. 
""I was speaking to a hostage negotiator this morning,"" Burley said. ""He made the comparison between the 50 hostages that Hamas promised to release, as opposed to the 150 prisoners that are Palestinians that Israel has said that it will release.""

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin reportedly told TF1 television on Sunday that the country was ""durably under threat from Islamist terrorism"" after a prosecutor identified the French 26-year-old born to Iranian parents accused of fatally stabbing a German tourist and injuring two others steps away from the Eiffel Tower in Paris over the weekend. 
At a news conference on Sunday, France's top anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said suspect Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab, a French national, recorded a video speaking in Arabic before the attack in which he swore allegiance to the Islamic State group, used a name to introduce himself that referred to the Islamic State in Afghanistan and expressed support for Islamic extremists and jihadists operating in various areas around the world, including in Africa, Iraq, Syria, Egypt's Sinai, Yemen, Iran and Pakistan. 

Ricard said Rajabpour-Miyandoab and three others, including family members and associates, were taken into police custody for questions after the attack.

As Israeli Defense Forces resumed military operations to eradicate the Hamas terrorist threat last Friday, the Biden administration is inserting itself into Israel’s war planning process, teaching the Israelis – who’ve been fighting for their survival for decades – how to properly prosecute the conflict. 
Washington warfare ""experts"" – who arguably haven’t secured a single clear military victory since 1945 – insist that Israeli military strategists alter their war plans to make their combat operations more targeted and their strikes more accurate, in order to minimize casualties, especially among civilians. 

The Biden administration’s demands, while noble-sounding, are misguided and unreasonable. Implementing these requirements, at the expense of achieving the main mission of eliminating Hamas and its entire supporting infrastructure, will likely prolong the conflict, ultimately resulting in many more Israeli and Palestinian deaths. Here’s why.

State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday that the Biden administration condemns reported sexual violence carried out by Hamas militants against Israeli women and girls and would support a United Nations investigation on the matter.
""We have been briefed extensively on a number of their findings. We don't, of course, have our own independent assessments to make right now,"" Miller said while describing the U.S. interactions with their Israeli counterparts.

""But we have seen Hamas commit atrocities both on October 7th and since October 7th. And we obviously condemn those atrocities and support Israel's actions to hold Hamas accountable for them,"" he continued.
The United Nations said last week that it would investigate sexual violence Israel claims Hamas terrorists committed against Israelis during their invasion on Oct. 7.
Miller said the U.S. would ""certainly support"" a U.N. investigation and ""The Israeli government is conducting one and they have our full backing in doing that.""

State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday during a briefing that if the Hamas terrorist group ""cared at all about civilian life"" in the Gaza Strip, they would lay down their weapons and move their operations out of civilian areas.
Miller made the remark during a heated exchange with a reporter over the civilian death toll that is mounting inside Gaza as Israel wages its military campaign to eliminate Hamas.

""Don't tell me that Hamas can't lay down their arms and take additional steps to protect civilians, let alone moving out of all the areas that are putting Palestinian civilians in harm's way,"" Miller said. ""They absolutely can. They could do it today if they cared at all about civilian life.""
Miller earlier said that the U.S. expects to see civilians casualties as a result of Israel's military campaign.
""That is sadly true in all wars. It is especially going to be true in a war in a crowded urban environment where the opponent, Hamas, is using civilians as human shields, in hiding themselves, hiding their fighters, hiding their infrastructure behind civilians,"" he said during the State Department press briefing.

""So what we have made clear to Israel is that we expect them to comply with international humanitarian law and do them do everything they can to minimize civilian harm. So we don't see a repeat in the south of what we saw in the north. And with respect to that. We're at the very early stage of the operation, and I think it's too soon to draw a definitive conclusion,"" Miller added.


The Israeli military said it launched its 10,000th airstrike against Hamas in the Gaza Strip late Sunday, as the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) ramps up its offensive in the south.

Israel has vowed to do everything it can to protect civilians as it targets Hamas and its network of tunnels. Many of the 10,000 airstrikes have been aimed at destroying Hamas' underground labyrinth.
Israel ordered evacuations from large sections of Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, on Monday. Critics say there are few places to evacuate to, as Southern Gaza is already crowded with Palestinians displaced during Israel's campaign against Hamas in the northern part of the strip.

The IDF says it has struck over 400 separate Hamas targets since the cease-fire agreement collapsed on Friday. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday that Hamas was to blame for the end of the cease-fire, because they did not release ""additional women and children that we know that they are holding, and they're refusing to let go.""

The Israeli Air Force
 wrote in a post on X Monday that it and the Israel Defense Forces ""continue to fight shoulder to shoulder throughout the Gaza Strip.
""In recent hours, the Air Force has eliminated terrorists of the terrorist organization Hamas, and rocket launchers, terrorist infrastructures, and weapons warehouses have also been attacked,"" it said.
The message came hours after the Air Force said its fighter jets and drones ""recently attacked an operational headquarters, terrorist infrastructures and military buildings of the terrorist organization Hezbollah in Lebanese territory.""

Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Fox News on Monday that he thinks Hamas might start releasing hostages again “when they start to feel the pain.” 
“And by applying military pressure and beefing up the strikes of the Israeli Defense Forces against Hamas' military machine, eliminating their commanders, when they start to feel the pain, maybe then we will have another opportunity to get our people out,” Regev added.


The top progressive lawmaker in the House is being criticized by fellow Democrats for downplaying Hamas terrorists’ reported sexual violence against Israeli women. 
Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was accused of trying to find a moral equivalence between Hamas and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) during a Sunday television interview.
""Hamas terrorists raped Israeli women and girls. The only ‘balanced’ approach is to condemn sexual violence loudly, forcefully and without exceptions. Outrageous for anyone to ‘both sides’ sexual violence,"" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., wrote on X Sunday evening.
Credible accounts of rape and brutal sexual assault are beginning to surface in the wake of Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which saw roughly 1,200 men, women and children killed in their homes and elsewhere. There are also concerns over whether sexual violence is still being carried out on the dozens of Israelis still held hostage by Hamas.
""I said it's horrific, and I think that rape is horrific. Sexual assault is horrific. I think that it happens in war situations. Terrorist organizations
 like Hamas, obviously are using these as tools,"" Jayapal said on CNN. ""However, I think we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians – 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, three-quarters of whom are women and children.""

An official from the Israeli army said Monday that at least 15,000 Palestinians have died in the war against Hamas, the Associated Press is reporting. 
The Israeli army said it considers more than 5,000 of the Gaza deaths to be Hamas militants. 
The Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health said Monday during a news conference in Khan Younis, a city in the southern Gaza Strip, that 15,899 people had been killed in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7. 

The Associated Press contributed to this report. 
Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Fox News on Monday that he thinks Hamas might start releasing hostages again “when they start to feel the pain.” 

""We believe very strongly that Hamas aren't suddenly going to change their behavior and become humanitarians. They will only release more hostages if they feel compelled to do so,” he said. 
“And by applying military pressure and beefing up the strikes of the Israeli Defense Forces against Hamas' military machine, eliminating their commanders, when they start to feel the pain, maybe then we will have another opportunity to get our people out,” Regev added. 
The adviser said there is “no alternative” to the Israeli military launching a ground invasion in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, saying Hamas has key infrastructure and commanders there. 

“We will get rid of them, they will no longer run the Gaza Strip when this is over,” Regev said, adding that “Hamas has been ruling there for 16 years and what have they brought the people of Gaza? Pain, suffering, bloodshed and poverty. It’s not a particularly impressive success level.” 


A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Fox News on Monday that “we have to fear” for the safety of Americans still being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, adding that ""I can't be confident that anyone is alive, unfortunately.” 
Mark Regev made the remark after White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on ‘Fox News Sunday’ that the U.S. believes around 9 Americans are still being held in the Gaza Strip. 
When asked on ‘America’s Newsroom’ where they might be, Regev told Fox News’ Bill Hemmer that they are “in some dungeon that Hamas is controlling.” 
Regev said the recent cease-fire and hostage-prisoner swap deal between Israel and Hamas – which expired last Friday – freed more than 100 hostages. 
""We have still got about 130 being held, including the Americans. And we have to fear for them because we have been interviewing the people who have come out and they went through a living hell,” he said. 
When asked if he still believes the Americans in Gaza are alive, Regev said ""I can't be confident that anyone is alive, unfortunately. We are dealing with a brutal terrorist group that has no qualms whatsoever about butchering people, we saw that on October 7th, when they entered Israel and they massacred our people."" 


Pro-Palestinian protesters have been captured on video targeting a restaurant co-owned by an Israeli chef in Philadelphia, drawing a rebuke from the state’s governor. 

The clip, shared on X, shows a crowd chanting ““Goldie, Goldie you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide!"" outside of a Goldie location in the city over the weekend. 
Goldie, which describes itself as an ""Israeli-style falafel shop,” is co-owned by Israeli chef Michael Solomonov. 
""Tonight in Philly, we saw a blatant act of antisemitism -- not a peaceful protest,"" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wrote on X in response to the video. 
""A restaurant was targeted and mobbed because its owner is Jewish and Israeli. This hate and bigotry is reminiscent of a dark time in history,"" Shapiro added.

EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., demanded an investigation into allegations that a controversial United Nations agency's employee detained one of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. 
""The United States will not be complicit in propping up Hamas' terrorism, and this report further proves why deep change is necessary within UNRWA before we even consider providing another dollar to the agency,"" Blackburn wrote in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital and addressed to U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield and United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. 

""It is deeply concerning that, despite the prevalence of these reports, the United Nations has seemingly done nothing to investigate or prevent the siphoning of UNRWA funding by terrorists, and UNRWA continues to double down on its claims that each subsequent, documented report is ‘unsubstantiated.’""
Blackburn has requested a response by Dec. 18 that addresses a report from Israeli reporter Almog Boker about a UNRWA employee who allegedly detained a hostage in their house for 50 days and details of any investigation into the report, as well as an explanation of UNRWA's ""process for ensuring its facilities are not used to support terrorist activities,"" among other points. 

Boker, a journalist with Israeli Channel 13, last week claimed on social media platform X that he had interviewed a recently released hostage who told him a UNRWA teacher held them hostage. He additionally claimed a Gazan doctor – allegedly a pediatrician – helped hold another hostage captive for Hamas. 
Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reported Monday that Israel and Hamas are not close to reaching another cease-fire deal. 
Yingst, citing regional sources that are directly familiar with the negotiations, said on “Fox & Friends” that a team from Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency was in Doha, Qatar on Saturday as the Qataris were trying to get another agreement together between the two sides. 
But that team was recalled back to Israel by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the director of Mossad after talks collapsed, Yingst said. 

He noted that one source stressed that just because Israeli are not in Doha doesn’t mean talks can’t continue, but Hamas over the weekend said it is unwilling to exchange further hostages until the war inside Gaza ends – something Israel’s military has been vowing to continue until Hamas is eliminated.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan claimed on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be tried as a ""war criminal"" after Israel's war against Hamas has concluded.
Erdogan does not recognize Hamas as a 
terrorist organization and has been deeply critical of Israel's campaign in Gaza. He compared Netanyahu to genocidal dictators of the past during a speech during a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul.
""Beyond being a war criminal, Netanyahu, who is the butcher of Gaza right now, will be tried as the butcher of Gaza, just as Milosevic was tried,"" Erdogan said, referencing a former Yugoslav president. ""Those who try to skip over the deaths of all those innocent people by using the excuse of Hamas have nothing left to say to humanity.""
Erdogan went on to criticize the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. He has long argued that the security council needs reforms.
Erdogan's comments come as Israel turns its focus toward southern Gaza following the collapse of a cease-fire with Hamas on Friday.
Israel's National Security Council has issued a new travel advisory Monday to citizens traveling and living abroad as it has ""identified increased efforts by Iran and its proxies, including Hamas and Global Jihad factions, to harm Israeli and Jewish targets around the world.""

The NSC said in a statement that ""Since the beginning of Operation Swords of Iron, the National Security Council has been conducting ongoing situation assessments together with the Israeli security organizations.""
""The threat level for many countries in Western Europe (including the UK, France and Germany), South America (including Brazil and Argentina), as well as Australia and Russia, has been raised to level 2, with the recommendation to exercise increased precaution,"" it noted.

""The threat level for countries in Africa (including South Africa and Eritrea) and Central Asia (including Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan) has been raised to level 3, with the recommendation to reconsider non-essential travel to these countries,"" the statement added.
The NSC also said ""Since the beginning of the war, we have identified increased efforts by Iran and its proxies, including Hamas and Global Jihad factions, to harm Israeli and Jewish targets around the world"" and ""At the same time, there is a constant and significant rise in incitement, attempted attacks and manifestations of antisemitism in many countries.""

The Israeli military said Monday that three soldiers have been injured along the Israel-Lebanon border following the targeting of an IDF post.
""During the night, a number of mortar bombs were detected from Lebanese territory towards an IDF post in the Shtula area,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari wrote on X. ""As a result, three IDF soldiers were slightly injured and evacuated for medical treatment, their families were informed.""
Hagari added that ""several mortar launches were detected a short time ago from Lebanese territory towards an IDF post in the Yiftach area"" and ""IDF forces attacked the sources of the shooting.""

He also said Monday that ""Fighter jets and remotely manned aircraft of the Air Force recently attacked an operational headquarters, terrorist infrastructures and military buildings of the terrorist organization Hezbollah in Lebanese territory.""


Israel’s military says it has killed Haitham Khojari, the commander of Hamas’ Shati Battalion who was involved in the execution of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel that launched the war. 

“The IDF, guided by the intelligence of the Shin Bet and the IDF, eliminated Haitham Khojari, the commander of the Shati Battalion of the terrorist organization Hamas, using an Air Force fighter jet,” Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a post on X on Sunday. “Under his command, they launched a raid into Israeli territory on October 7.” 
Hagari posted a video appearing to show the airstrike being carried out against Khojari. 
The IDF's Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee said Khojari also “led efforts to secure Hamas activities inside Al-Shifa Hospital and led the fight against IDF forces in the Al-Shati camp area” of the Gaza Strip. 
“Within the framework of his duties, he was responsible for numerous 
terrorist operations against Israeli citizens,” Adraee added.

The leader of Israel's domestic security agency, Shin Bet, has been heard on audio saying his organization is prepared to destroy Hamas “in every place.""
Ronen Bar's comments were aired late last night by Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11, according to the Associated Press.

“In every place, in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Turkey, in Qatar, everywhere,” Bar said in a recording. “It’ll take a few years but we will be there to do it.”
Bar compared the mission to Israel’s operation to assassinate militants behind the 1972 killings of members of its Olympic team in Munich, Germany.
It's not immediately clear when Bar's comments were recorded.
Most of Hamas’ top leadership lives in exile, primarily in the Gulf state of Qatar, a key player in bringing about the recently expired truce between Israel and Hamas, and the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.
A prominent Republican lawmaker is calling on a left-wing fundraising juggernaut to stop processing contributions for Hamas-sympathizing groups.

ActBlue, the leading fundraising platform for Democrat campaigns and groups nationwide, processes donations for a handful of organizations that have partaken in or amplified rallies celebrating Hamas' bloody Oct. 7 attack on innocent Israeli civilians that left more than 1,200 dead and hundreds taken hostage.
""It's shocking that Democrats' primary fundraising vehicle is helping bankroll antisemitic protests across the country where Hamas terrorists are honored as martyrs,"" Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told Fox News Digital.
""ActBlue should cut off access to these pro-Hamas groups or Democrats should leave the platform,"" Daines said.

ActBlue, which has helped raise more than $12 billion for Democrat politicians and causes, helps round up donations for several groups that have backed rallies in support of Hamas' bloody incursion or issued statements supporting it.
One such group for which ActBlue helped process donations is the U.S.-Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), the Daily Caller reported. The USPCN has hosted multiple protests to celebrate Hamas' deadly aggression on Israeli civilians.
In October, the USPCN organized an ""All Out for Palestine"" protest in Houston, where protesters praised Hamas as ""martyrs."" They also organized identical rallies in other areas, such as Detroit, where protesters chanted, ""When people are occupied, violence is justified.""
Fox News' Joe Schoffstall contributed to this report.


The Israeli Defense Forces said Monday morning that it has hit roughly 200 Hamas terrorist targets during operations in Gaza.
""Troops struck terrorist infrastructure located inside a school and found 2 tunnel shafts, including a booby-trapped one, explosives and additional weapons,"" the IDF wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

""An [Israeli Air Force] aircraft struck vehicles containing missiles, mortar shells and weapons—thwarting an imminent attack against IDF soldiers,"" the post continued.
The IDF added, ""The Israeli Navy struck the Hamas naval observation posts and terrorist infrastructure at the Gaza harbor.""

UNIVERSITY QUIETLY DROPS FACULTY DEI REQUIREMENTS IN FREE SPEECH 'VICTORY,' CIVIL RIGHTS ORG SAYS
As the Israel-Hamas war becomes a flashpoint on many college campuses, FIRE examined data from its 2024 College Free Speech Rankings.
Researchers found that colleges where students accept ""illiberal forms of protest"" — such as shouting down speakers or using violence to stop a campus speech event — were also places where students reported having a hard time talking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even before Oct. 7.
These schools were more likely to have had protests, walkouts, classroom disruptions, vandalism or other incidents in the month following Hamas' attack on Israel, according to FIRE's analysis.
FIRE's analysis of campus speech climates and post-Oct. 7 incidents used data from its most recent free speech rankings. (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression)
MOMS SUE STATE OVER 'CREEPY' BABY BLOOD DATABASE, PRIVACY CONCERNS
Campuses with shaky speech climates included George Washington University, where students held a vigil for Palestinian ""martyrs"" and, on a separate occasion, projected pro-Palestinian messages on the side of the school library. And at Tulane University, a pro-Palestinian rally devolved into a brawl that ended with three students being assaulted.
The report acknowledges that ""correlation is not causation,"" but calls the results ""not surprising.""
""Where campus tensions bubble below the surface, sudden flare-ups might become more likely in response to distressing events,"" the report states.
GROUPS FEAR FACULTY THAT DEFENDED HAMAS COULD SET CALIFORNIA STANDARDS: 'INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF ANTISEMITISM’
FIRE surveys tens of thousands of students across the nation each year to help determine which colleges are the most — and least — accepting of different viewpoints. The most recent survey of 254 colleges was fielded from January through June of this year, well before Hamas' attack.
FIRE president Greg Lukianoff told Fox News he has ""no doubt"" that what is happening on campuses after Oct. 7 will influence next year's College Free Speech Rankings.
""Those ratings were not good already, particularly on Israel-Palestine,"" he said. ""And I think they are going to absolutely crater this next year.""

The FIRE survey also found that just 1 in four 4 students believe a pro-Israeli student group should be allowed on campus, compared to 58% of Jewish students who believe a pro-Palestinian group should be allowed.
Students at private colleges were more accepting of ""illiberal protest"" than their peers at public universities but also found it more difficult to have an open and honest conversation about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the survey found.

Israel-Hamas war: Israeli military conducts strikes on southern Lebanon | Live Updates from Fox News Digital,2023-11-11,Fox News,[],"incoming update…
Coverage for this event has ended.


A pro-Palestinian protest organized to ""flood Manhattan for Gaza"" began Friday afternoon in Columbus Circle and ultimately ended hours later in the vicinity of the Grand Central Terminal in New York City.
During the protest, a pro-Palestinian demonstrator was arrested by NYPD officers after he climbed a street post to tear down flags representing the United States and the United Nations.
The Israel Defense Force's International spokesperson, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, and an Operations Officer in the Givati Brigade, Maj. (Res.) Shay, provided a briefing on the evacuation of the Rantisi Hospital.
The IDF said hundreds of Hamas terrorists were seen over and underground, and troops arrived at the hospital ""knowing that there were Hamas terrorists in it.""

""We called civilians to leave [the] hospital for three days,"" Shay said. ""We wanted to evacuate civilians and sick people. We realized civilians are held by Hamas there. We got close, surrounded hospital and opened a safe passage out of hospital. We saw terrorists in the crowds evacuating between the civilians. We had a dilemma – do we attack Hamas terrorists between the people? We decided not to use snipers and not shoot.""
Shay added: ""We did not want people to panic. We saw Hamas terrorists shooting at people to force them back into hospital. We decided not to act and we unfortunately let the terrorists leave with civilians – they used people as human shields. We let that happen in order not to hurt civilians. We identified in that spot at least 5 to 6 terrorists inside the crowds and others in the hospital, we saw them via the windows.""

Hecht said, ""We will continue to destroy all Hamas capabilities. We are doing our best to encourage civilians to evacuate these areas. Hospitals need to be evacuated in order for us to deal with Hamas. Shifa Hospital: we are seeing a presence of several thousands in the courtyard. We are pushing forward to increase the number of people leaving the hospital.""
According to Shay, people left the hospital by foot, in ambulances and on wheelchairs.

President Biden will travel to San Francisco for a high-stakes meeting
 with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 30th annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.
The showdown between the leaders of the world's two largest economies, who are on the opposite end of many issues, is likely to dominate the summit.
For Biden, it will be an opportunity to highlight some of the areas where cooperation is possible, while also issuing stern warnings on key U.S. national interests in the region. The Chinese president will likely assert China’s ability to influence global affairs and act as a mediator in some of the world's conflicts.
APEC is a coalition of nations with conflicting interests and values. It groups member economies and not nations and covers nearly 40% of the global population, about 62% of GDP and almost half of global trade, according to the State Department. Participants include Taiwan, an island territory that Beijing considers part of China, but the U.S. backs with military support.

This will be the first meeting between Biden and Xi since they met on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting in Bali in November 2022. Biden’s meeting with Xi comes after several high-level U.S. officials met with their Chinese counterparts to ease tensions after the spy balloon incident earlier this year.
The U.S. and China are fundamentally at odds on many issues, and there are low expectations the meeting will yield significant results.
""There is no need for President Biden to meet with Xi Jinping to talk about Ukraine and Israel next Wednesday,"" China expert Gordon Chang told Fox News Digital. ""If Biden wants Beijing to stop supporting Russia’s war against Ukraine and Iran’s war on Israel, he needs to impose severe costs on China.""

The Israel Defense Forces released a recap of its activity over the last 24 hours as its war against Hamas terrorists continues.

The IDF says it neutralized terrorist cells, took control of 11 Hamas terrorist posts, neutralized a vehicle rigged with explosives, located and destroyed an underground terrorist tunnel route, struck Hamas weapons storage facilities and struck military targets inside the Al-Shati Camp.
More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel since Hamas launched its largest attack against Israel in decades on Oct. 7, prompting military response from Israeli forces. Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.
Service at Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan was temporarily suspended on Friday after mobs of pro-Palestinian demonstrators flooded the streets of New York City to protest Israel's war in Gaza, creating chaos as some tried to break into the closed station.
The pro-Palestinian rally began at 5 p.m. Friday with over a thousand individuals marching through the streets. Some were seen tearing down posters of the hostages being held by Hamas terrorists and crumbling them up while other demonstrators burned an Israeli flag.

According to an Instagram post from pro-Palestinian organizations, Within Our Lifetime and the City University of New York for Palestine, the protest was to ""flood Manhattan for Gaza.""
""Gaza calls, we respond. Palestine will be free, because when we resist we win together. Cease genocide. Cease the siege. Cease the blockade. Cease occupation. Cease funding Israel. Cease settler colonization. Cease Zionism. Cease imperialism,"" the social media post read, in part.
In social media posts, the Palestinian Youth Movement and other groups called for people to walk out of their workplaces, schools and other activities to join the demonstration.
Video from the protest Friday night showed one protester climbing up a streetpost to tear down American flags and United Nations flags while hoards of protesters gathered and cheered at the base.

The nation's top universities are ramping up their efforts to combat antisemitism after facing intense backlash in the wake of the unfolding war between Israel and Hamas.
Columbia University announced Friday it would suspend Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace from campus through the end of the fall term over alleged violations of the school's policies.

A statement from Columbia senior vice president Gerald Rosberg said the two pro-Palestinian groups held an ""unauthorized event"" on Thursday ""that proceeded despite warnings"" and ""included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.""
Brandeis University similarly announced Monday it was banning its SJP organization from holding campus activities.
Harvard President Claudine Gay released a statement Thursday condemning antisemitism and described the pro-Palestinian ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" rally cry as crossing the line.
""Our community must understand that phrases such as ‘from the river to the sea’ bear specific historical meanings that to a great many people imply the eradication of Jews from Israel and engender both pain and existential fears within our Jewish community. I condemn this phrase and any similarly hurtful phrases,"" Gay wrote.

A pro-Palestinian rally at The University of Maryland is under investigation by the school and Maryland law enforcement after students claimed the demonstration turned ""antisemitic.""
Students spoke out against a Students for Justice in Palestine rally held on campus, Thursday, accusing it of antisemitic messages. Witnesses of the event told a local outlet that messages like ""Holocaust 2.0"" were written in chalk on campus walkways near where the rally was held.

The event led one student to fear for her safety. ""Now that I know what some people on this campus think, I don't feel as safe walking around. Especially alone and especially at night,"" the student told a CBS affiliate.
The pro-Palestinian group that put on the rally says its mission is to ""work in solidarity with the Palestinian people's struggle for human rights."" An Instagram post advertising the rally called on students to ""Walk out and sit in at Hornbake Plaza in calling for a ceasefire and reiterating our demands to the University of Maryland administration!!!""
""Bring flags, kuffiyahs, and chalk!!"" the post added.
It also implored students to ""Stand on the right side of history AGAINST GENOCIDE #ceasefirenow.""
University of Maryland staff acknowledged the ""hateful"" and ""antisemitic"" turn the rally took Thursday and declared that an investigation into the incident was underway. 

In a public statement, school officials said, ""We are aware of hateful, antisemitic sentiment expressed at today’s demonstration by Students for Justice in Palestine. We condemn it in no uncertain terms. The offensive actions of a few should not reflect on the vast majority of protesters who were there to peacefully express their views, but there is no place for any antisemitic message, behavior or action at the University of Maryland.""
The statement also noted that Maryland police are on the case as well, adding, ""The University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) has launched an immediate investigation and continues to conduct real-time threat assessments. Responsible parties will be held accountable.""
The Anti-Defamation League’s D.C. chapter and University of Maryland Jewish groups put out a joint statement Friday condemning the rally.
""We are deeply disturbed that students at University of Maryland were met yesterday with antisemitic graffiti that said, ‘Holocaust 2.0.’ This imagery is deeply troubling whether it was meant to trivialize the Holocaust or seen as a direct threat against Jewish students. Either way it is dangerous and unacceptable,"" they stated.
Students for Justice in Palestine is a far-left group which celebrated the Hamas terrorist attack as a ""historic"" victory for Palestinian resistance. Brandeis University said Monday it will no longer recognize Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) on its campus.

The school’s spokesperson Julie Jette told Fox News Digital, ""National SJP has called on its chapters to engage in conduct that supports Hamas in its call for the elimination of the only Jewish state in the world and its people. Such expression is not protected by Brandeis' principles of free speech.""
It was also suspended from campus on Friday by Columbia University.

Michael Ramirez, the political cartoonist whose work mocking Hamas was pulled by The Washington Post following internal and external backlash, is speaking out about the ""unfortunate"" episode restricting free speech. 
The cartoon titled ""Human shields"" depicted the terrorist group's spokesperson saying, ""How dare Israel attack civilians,"" while a frightened-looking woman and four small children remain bound with rope to his body.

""I think it's empirically true that Hamas uses civilians, both Palestinians and Israelis, as human shields,"" Ramirez told Fox News Digital in an interview Friday. ""I don't think it's a hidden knowledge that they operate their bases in densely populated areas and under civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, they fire rockets from densely residential areas, and by design, to sacrifice the lives of the innocent people.""
Ramirez, who is employed by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, has a collaborative agreement with the Washington Post so that his work simultaneously appears in both papers on Tuesdays and Saturdays. 
While the paper ultimately retracted the anti-Hamas cartoon, the Review-Journal is standing behind it.

He predicted his cartoon would spark some sort of visceral reaction among some based on the current political climate but suggested those who claim to be advocating for innocent Palestinians ""have a tendency to kind of erase the boundaries"" when it comes to Hamas. 
The conservative-leaning Ramirez shed light on his working relationship with Post opinions editor David Shipley, who handpicked the anti-Hamas cartoon after the cartoonist provided multiple options for him to choose from.
""In this case, we both thought that was a bold cartoon,"" Ramirez said. 
It didn't take long for outrage on social media to mount but also within The Washington Post newsroom as the paper's executive editor Sally Buzbee wrote in an email Wednesday to staff acknowledging the ""many deep concerns"" that were made. 

Left-wing critics accused the cartoon of being racist, pointing to the exaggerated features depicted in the cartoon of Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad. Ramirez rejected such claims, sending Fox News Digital examples of other political figures he has drawn including former President Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., all having similar features. 
But the pressure both internally and externally reached a boiling point as Shipley deleted the cartoon from the Post's website, replacing it with an apologetic editor's note and letters from readers condemning the illustration.

French President Emmanuel Macron called for a cease-fire in Gaza in an interview with the BBC.
During the interview, Macron said he recognizes Israel's right to protect itself, but said ""we do urge them to stop this bombing"" in Gaza.
He also called on leaders in the U.S. and U.K. to join his calls for a cease-fire, stating ""I hope they will.""
""De facto - today, civilians are bombed - de facto. These babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed. So there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop,"" Macron said.
During a speech at the France Peace Forum on Friday, Macron said, speaking about Israel, ""The challenges accumulate, often in these same countries who in the name of thinking of security because they have faced terrorism or regional instability. And, at the same time, the means aren't there.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by stating, ""The responsibility for harming civilians lies with Hamas-ISIS and not with Israel.""
""Let's recall that Israel entered the war because the terrorist organization brutally murdered hundreds of Israelis and kidnapped more than 200 Israelis. While Israel does everything to avoid harming civilians and calls on them to leave the combat zones - Hamas-ISIS does everything to prevent them from leaving safe areas and uses them as a human shield,"" Netanyahu said. ""Hamas-ISIS brutally holds our hostages - women, children and the elderly - in a crime against humanity.""

""World leaders must condemn Hamas-ISIS and not Israel,"" he said.

Conservative criticism is mounting against The Washington Post for pulling an anti-Hamas political cartoon after some staffers expressed ""deep concerns"" about the panel.
The cartoon by the Las Vegas Review-Journal's Michael Ramirez, who is also published in the Post twice a week, was titled ""Human shields"" and depicted a Hamas spokesperson saying, ""How dare Israel attack civilians,"" while a frightened-looking woman and four children are bound with rope to his body.
The cartoon was featured in the Nov. 8 print edition of the paper and online, which was later deleted after backlash, both internally and externally.

""There was both external criticism and internal criticism. I think a number of people inside and outside were offended by the caricature, both of the man and the woman. I’m not sure, however, if the message itself [criticizing Hamas] was the problem,"" one Washington Post insider told Fox News Digital.
The deletion and The Post's subsequent apology angered some conservative political commentators online, who bashed the outlet for refusing to stand by the cartoon.
""Let the word go forth, for the woke have spoken: terrorist groups using human shields is not problematic,"" political consultant Noah Pollak wrote in a post on X. ""But making fun of terrorist groups using human shields is deeply problematic.""
""Kind of surprised the Washington Post pulled this cartoon, given that it's a completely accurate depiction of Hamas's tactics,"" The Bulwark's Sonny Bunch wrote on X. 
Journalist Jeryl Bier wrote that he was not convinced of The Post's reasoning behind its apology. ""I am skeptical that retracting a cartoon because some people complain is the ‘spirit of opinion journalism.’""

A United Nations watchdog has criticized the organization for passing multiple resolutions this week condemning Israel for various alleged human rights violations, but making no condemnation of Hamas or other groups or nations, at a time when antisemitism is on the rise.

""The U.N.’s assault on Israel with a torrent of one-sided resolutions, just one month after the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and on the 85th anniversary of Kristallnacht, is surreal,"" Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, said in a press release. 
""The only purpose of these eight lopsided condemnations is to demonize the Jewish state,"" Neuer said. ""The world should not be deceived that these annual resolutions advance the cause of peace or human rights in any way.""
The U.N.’s Second Committee, which focuses on Economic and Financial issues, announced the passage of three such resolutions, including one demanding that Israel cease the ""exploitation, damage, cause of loss or depletion and endangerment"" in the Golan Heights region of Syria. 

Syria drafted and co-sponsored the resolutions, which passed with a vote of 151 in favor to six against — only Canada, Israel, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and the U.S. opposed the measure, and 11 members abstained from voting. 
""These are Arab lands,"" the representative of Syria said after the vote. ""They will return to their original legitimate owners sooner or later."" 


Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent medical supplies to Israel on Friday after Barzilai hospital in Ashkelon, Israel sustained damage from a Hamas attack, according to the Israeli consulate in Miami.

Columbia University announced it has suspended the school's Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace chapters.
Gerald Rosberg, senior vice president of Columbia University, said the student groups violated campus policy on Thursday afternoon when they held an unauthorized event that included threats.

""Columbia University is suspending Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) as official student groups through the end of the fall term. This decision was made after the two groups repeatedly violated University policies related to holding campus events, culminating in an unauthorized event Thursday afternoon that proceeded despite warnings and included threatening rhetoric and intimidation,"" Rosberg said.
SJP and JVP will not be able to hold events on campus or receive university funding through the fall semester.

Rosberg said their suspensions will be lifted when they demonstrate a commitment to following university policies and engage in ""consultations at a group leadership level with University officials.""
""Like all student groups, SJP and JVP are required to abide by University policies
 and procedures. This ensures both the safety of our community and that core University activities can be conducted without disruption. During this especially charged time on our campus, we are strongly committed to giving space to student groups to participate in debate, advocacy, and protest. This relies on community members abiding by the rules and cooperating with University administrators who have a duty to ensure the safety of everyone in our community,"" Rosberg said. 


The Israel Defense Forces said it conducted retaliatory air strikes against several Hezbollah targets on Friday.
IDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a post on X that fighter jets and aircraft launched the strikes in response to launches from Hezbollah on Thursday.
The IDF strikes were targeting buildings where Hezbollah terrorists were operating, Hagari said.

""In response to the launches in the last day, fighter jets and aircraft attacked a series of terrorist targets of the Hezbollah organization in Lebanese territory,"" Hagari said. ""Among the targets attacked were a number of buildings and military positions where the organization's terrorists operated, a weapons warehouse and an intelligence infrastructure from which terrorists directed terror against the State of Israel.""

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is condemning unrest in Montreal as ""unacceptable"" after police this week reported shots being fired at two Jewish schools and a fight between Israel and Palestinian supporters. 

A Montreal police spokesperson told the CBC that investigators received two 911 calls yesterday morning regarding shots being fired at the Talmud Torah Elementary School and Yeshiva Gedola of Montreal, both in Quebec city’s Côte-des-Neiges neighborhood. 
In both instances, police say the callers said the front doors of the buildings had been struck by bullets, but nobody was inside the facilities at the time and there were no injuries, according to the CBC. 
On Wednesday, a 22-year-old student was taken into custody for allegedly assaulting a 54-year-old security guard at Concordia University in Montreal during an altercation between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian supporters that left three injured, the news agency also reported. 
""I understand that people are so profoundly disturbed by what they see happening there,"" Trudeau said Thursday, according to Reuters. 

But he added that ""violence, hate, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and scenes such as the ones we saw in Concordia University or shots fired at Jewish schools overnight -- all of that is unacceptable.""

IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner on Friday confirmed a report that Israeli soldiers found a Hamas terror tunnel inside a child's bedroom in northern Gaza. 

""In more than once instance,"" Lerner said on ""Outnumbered."" 
The Israel Defense Force's Combat Engineering Corps discovered the opening to a tunnel belonging to the terrorist group Hamas inside a civilian residence, the Times of Israel reported. The tunnel was located in an ""upscale beachside neighborhood,"" at a house with an outdoor swimming pool, according to the report. 
""Inside a bedroom scattered with brightly colored clothes, underneath one of three child-sized beds, soldiers had found a portal to where monsters were hiding,"" the report said.
According to those who closely track the Iranian-backed terror group, as well as admissions by its own leaders, Hamas has built
 an approximately 300-mile subterranean system that snakes beneath civilian homes, schools and hospitals in urban areas of the Gaza Strip.
Israel has pummeled Gaza with airstrikes targeting places where Hamas' underground command centers are believed to exist, often near civilian infrastructure where innocent Palestinians become casualties of the war.

Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, elicited boos and verbal attacks from anti-Israel protesters when walking past them waving an Israeli flag.
Boos and shouts of ""Shame!"" were thrown at Fetterman as he exited the building, waving the Israeli flag while passing progressive protesters from the veterans group About Face calling for a cease-fire amid Israel's war against the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas.
Several protesters were in the process of being arrested outside the Russell Senate Office Building as Fetterman walked by, while others — including one wearing a keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian nationalism — shouted at the senator from behind police tape.
""What a joke!"" one protester yelled as Fetterman passed by them. Another accused Fetterman of supporting ""genocide.""

Fetterman, however, laughed off the criticism, continuing to wave the Israeli flag and walking off as the protesters chanted for a cease-fire.
One protester was heard at the end of the video shouting that Fetterman was ""doing a disservice to Pennsylvania.""
""Jacka-- [Fetterman] saw veterans getting arrested and laughed,"" tweeted About Face, the progressive, anti-war veterans group that called for the National Guard to ""stand down"" to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.
""We asked to see [Senator Kirsten Gillibrand],"" About Face continued. ""We were put in cuffs.""
""We need leaders who listen to veterans demanding a [cease-fire],"" the group added.
Fetterman's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Neither did Gillibrand's office or About Face.

More than half of the countries across the globe now pose heightened risks for Americans, the State Department says, as it issued another ""worldwide caution"" this week for travelers as the Israel-Hamas war rages on. 

The State Department’s travel advisory system rates countries on a level of 1 to 4 based on the risks Americans face while visiting them.  
As of Friday, 21 countries have earned the ""Level 4: Do Not Travel"" rating, while 20 are at ""Level 3: Reconsider Travel"" and more than 70 are at ""Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution."" 
Among the countries that pose the greatest threats to Americans’ safety is Lebanon, which borders Israel to the north. 
""Do Not travel to Lebanon due to the unpredictable security situation related to rocket, missile, and artillery exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah or other armed militant factions,"" the State Department warns. ""Reconsider travel to Lebanon due to terrorism, civil unrest, armed conflict, crime, kidnapping, and Embassy Beirut’s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens."" 

The State Department also is urging any Americans to reconsider travel to Israel due to ""terrorism and civil unrest.""

U.S. defense officials say there have been 47 attacks on U.S. military forces since Oct. 17. (Fox News)

A U.S. defense official confirms a one-way attack drone was launched at U.S. forces at al-Tanf Garrison, Syria on Friday morning. 
The drone was shot down before it reached its target. No injuries or damage to infrastructure, the official said. 

This is the fifth confirmed attack on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since Wednesday night's U.S. airstrikes in Syria (four in Syria, one in Iraq). 
This is the 23rd attack in Syria and there have been 24 attacks in Iraq. 
The Israel Defense Forces said three drones were launched from Lebanon at northern Israel on Friday after 4:30 p.m. local time. Israeli jets intercepted one aircraft, and two additional aircraft fell in the northern area, the military said. 
“The incident has ended and its details are under review,” the IDF added.
U.S. forces conducted a self-defense airstrike Wednesday on a Syrian weapons storage facility in response to a series of recent attacks targeting American personnel in Iraq and Syria, the Department of Defense said.

 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Wednesday launched a raid on the city of Jenin and its refugee camp - two strongholds of Palestinian terrorist activity - in the West Bank.

The IDF operation in the West Bank, known by Israelis by its biblical name Judea and Samaria, raises questions about the opening of a third front in Israel’s response to Hamas’ multipronged attack against the Jewish state on Oct. 7, resulting in the massacre of 1,400 people in southern Israel.
The IDF said in a statement that its counterterrorism forces ""exchanged fire with armed terrorists, over ten terrorists were killed, and over 20 wanted suspects were apprehended, among them Nur and Minur Salma, Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists."" The U.S. has designated the Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad a foreign terrorist organization.
The fighting comes at a time when the Biden administration is cautioning Israeli actions in the West Bank, especially when it comes to violence from a small group of extremist settlers who have been involved in armed confrontations with Palestinian villagers in the area.

Anti-Israel protesters invaded the lobby of The New York Times on Thursday, demanding a cease-fire in Gaza and insisting the liberal paper favors Israel in its coverage of the ongoing war.  

A group of protesters entered the atrium of the Times building in Midtown Manhattan carrying a banner calling for a cease-fire.

Police believe Iran may be linked to the attempted murder of the former head of Spain's People's Party in Catalonia. 
Alejo Vidal-Quadras was shot in the face while in the Salamanca region of Madrid on Thursday around 1:30 p.m. He was later taken to the hospital where he is still recovering.
A police source with inside information on the investigation told The Associated Press that 76-year-old Vidal-Quadras, while recovering in the hospital, theorized the gunmen could be linked to Iran. 
The Iranian foreign ministry previously placed sanctions on Vidal-Quadras due to his relationship with Iran's opposition-in-exile, the People’s Mujahedin of Iran.

Police say they have no evidence the Iranian government was involved in the assassination attempt, but they are looking into the theory as one of several possible motives.
Two men seen on a Yamaha motorcycle are believed to be connected to the assassination attempt.
The man who shot Vidal-Quadras dismounted the black motorbike and pulled the gun while his face was obscured by a helmet. Both men escaped on the vehicle following the attack. 
The single gunshot fractured Vidal-Quadras's jawbone but is not believed to be life-threatening. 
The scene of the shooting has been roped off by authorities, and no suspects have been arrested yet.

The IDF said Friday it has attacked more than 15,000 terrorist targets in the Gaza strip and destroyed or confiscated 6,000 weapons since the start of the war on Oct. 7.
The seized or destroyed weapons include firearms, rockets, anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, explosive devices and ammunition, according to the Israeli military.
The IDF said targets struck include Hamas operational headquarters, terrorist infrastructures, rocket array infrastructures, logistics warehouses, command and control targets, governmental targets, intelligence targets, launch sites, terrorist tunnels and individual Hamas terrorists. 

The Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza claims the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli strikes has risen to 11,078, including 4,506 children and 3,027 women. Those numbers cannot be independently verified and Hamas does not distinguish between its fighters and civilians. 
The ministry said in an online statement Friday that another 27,490 Palestinians in Gaza have been wounded, the Associated Press reported.
Israel has rejected calls for a cease-fire and vowed to continue the war until Hams is wiped out.

There was internal uproar at The Washington Post over a political cartoon that mocked the terrorist group Hamas, Fox News Digital confirmed. 
In an email to staffers on Wednesday, the paper's executive editor Sally Buzbee wrote, ""Given the many deep concerns and conversations today in our newsroom, I wanted to ensure everyone saw the notes sent out tonight by The Post's opinions editor, David Shipley, to Post readers and to his staff in opinions.""
The Post cartoon titled ""Human shields"" depicted a Hamas spokesperson saying, ""How dare Israel attack civilians,"" while a frightened-looking woman and four small children remain bound with rope to his body.

The cartoon was featured in the Nov. 8 print edition of the paper and online, which was later deleted upon viral backlash. 
Buzbee forwarded the editor's note penned by Shipley offering a somber message to readers expressing regret over the cartoon. 
""As editor of the opinion section, I am responsible for what appears in its pages and on its screens. The section depends on my judgment,"" Shipley began. ""A cartoon published by Michael Ramirez on the war in Gaza, a cartoon whose publication I approved, was seen by many readers as racist. This was not my intent. I saw the drawing as a caricature of a specific individual, the Hamas spokesperson, who celebrated the attacks on unarmed civilians in Israel.""

""However, the reaction to the image convinced me that I had missed something profound, and divisive, and I regret that. Our section is aimed at finding commonalities, understanding the bonds that hold us together, even in the darkest times,"" he continued. ""In this spirit, we have taken down the drawing. We are also pushing a selection of responses to the caricature. And we will continue to make the section home to a range of views and perspectives, including ones that challenge readers.

A Palestinian, who was heralded as a ""hero"" and compared to ""Rosa Parks"" by liberal media after she assaulted an Israel Defense Force (IDF) soldier in Nabi Selah, a village in the West Bank, was arrested Monday by the IDF for allegedly inciting terrorism and calling to drink the blood of Jews. 
""The IDF has carried out substantial numbers of counterterrorism activity since Oct. 7 and has apprehended hundreds of suspects. Overnight, the IDF carried out activity to apprehend individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity and incitement,"" the IDF said. ""During the activity, Ahed Tamimi, who is suspected of inciting violence and calling for terrorist activity to be carried out, was apprehended in the town of Nabi Saleh. Tamimi was transferred to Israeli security forces for further questioning."" 

Ahed Tamimi,'s arrest pertained to a social media post allegedly from her social media account, which called for Palestinians to drink Jewish blood and eat their skulls. 
""Our message to the herd of settlers, we are waiting for you in all the West Bank cities from Hebron to Jenin - we will slaughter you and you will say what Hitler did to you was a joke, we will drink your blood and eat your skulls, come on, we are waiting for you,"" the image, posted to IG stories, allegedly said. 
Tamimi's mother first denied that the posts were from her daughter's official account, and later said the account was hacked. 
Tamimi was an icon to the liberal media after an Israeli military court sentenced her to eight months in prison for slapping and kicking two soldiers in 2018. The assault featured glorified coverage in liberal media outlets.

The top United Nations human rights official is calling for an investigation into what he called Israel's ""indiscriminate bombardment and shelling"" of densely populated areas in the Gaza Strip.

Speaking in the Jordanian capital Friday, Volker Türk said Israel “must immediately end the use of such methods and means of warfare and the attacks must be investigated,"" the Associated Press reported.
Citing civilian casualty figures provided by the Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza, Türk said Israel's targeting of civilian infrastructure raises ""serious concerns that these amount to disproportionate attacks in breach of international humanitarian law.”
Israel has said Hamas terrorists hide military targets amongst civilian infrastructure and has released videos showing rocket launchers inside boy scout clubs and other places. The IDF alleges Hamas has placed its main military compound beneath Al-Shifa hospital, the largest hospital in Gaza.
Türk said strikes on and near hospitals have been ""particularly intense,"" adding that any use by Palestinian armed groups of civilians or civilian structures to shield themselves from attack contravenes the laws of war.

Even so, he said the actions of Palestinian terrorists ""does not absolve Israel of its obligation to ensure that civilians are spared.”

""The President has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today's action to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests,"" Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Wednesday. 

U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked at least 46 times since Oct. 17, many from drone strikes. Of these attacks, 24 occurred in Iraq and 22 took place in Syria. They included a mix of one-way attack drones and rockets.
Fox News Digital's Elizabeth Pritchett and Louis Casiano contributed to this update.



The Israel Defense Forces said it is conducting strikes in response to anti-tank missiles launched from Lebanon toward a northern Israel military post near the area of Manara.
""IDF artillery is currently striking the source of the fire,"" the force posted on its website just after noon local time.
Hezbollah has traded fire with Israeli troops along the border since the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack in southern Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip. Both sides have suffered casualties, but the fear is that the conflict will escalate and spiral into a regional fight.
The terrorist group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, gave a speech last week in which he said Hezbollah ""already entered the battle on Oct. 8."" 
For Hezbollah, fully entering the Israel-Hamas war would risk dragging Lebanon — beset by economic calamity and internal political tensions — into a conflict it can ill afford, fueling domestic opposition to the group.

For now, the terrorist group can show support for Hamas by harassing Israel's military on the northern border while threatening to launch a full-scale war unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire.

New Israeli airstrikes against northern Gaza. (Trey Yingst)

Israeli forces were conducting airstrikes in northern Gaza Friday morning as the Israel-Hamas war enters its 34th day, according to Fox News' Trey Yingst.
Yingst shared that three hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip are reportedly surrounded by Israel Defense Forces troops while an undisclosed number of civilians are inside being treated. The hospitals are believed to be where Hamas militants are hiding.
On Thursday, approximately 80,000 people left northern Gaza through the evacuation corridors as Israel works to limit civilian casualties, according to Yingst via the IDF.
Overnight, the IDF said it killed a handful of Hamas' Nukbha terrorists, including two commanders, who participated in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Ahmed Musa, company commander, and Omar Al-Hindi, platoon commander, were the two leaders killed in western Jabalya, based on IDF and Israel Securities Authority intelligence.

Musa was one of the commanders over Hamas' invasion into Zikim Base, Kibbutz Zikim and the Yiftach Post, the IDF said. He was also accused of leading attacks against IDF troops in western Jabalya within the past 24 hours.
Mohammed Kahlout, head of the Sniper Array of Hamas' Northern Brigade, was also killed overnight, based on IDF and ISA intelligence, in addition to approximately 19 Hamas operatives who planned to attack Israeli forces.
The IDF also reported that 37 of its soldiers have been killed since the ground portion of the fight against Hamas began, according to Yingst.

GOP senators introduce stand-alone bill to aid Israel without more funding to Ukraine,2023-10-26,Fox News,['Jamie Joseph'],"FOX News' Greg Palkot on fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters.
GOP Sens. Roger Marshall, Ted Cruz, JD Vance and Mike Lee introduced a stand-alone bill to funnel aid to Israel without tying it to Ukraine aid on Thursday.
The bill, called the Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act, is an alternative to President Biden’s $106 billion emergency supplemental bill he requested from Congress last week.
The Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act, if passed, would provide $14.3 billion to Israel, including $10.6 billion for assistance through the Department of Defense (DOD), $3.5 billion for foreign military financing and $200 million to help protect U.S. embassies and personnel.

BIDEN ADMIN URGES MAJOR FUNDING INCREASES FOR AID TO UKRAINE, ISRAEL AND GAZA CIVILIANS 
The legislation expedites funding for Israel by allocating resources to bolster Israel's defense capabilities, specifically focusing on enhancing systems like the Iron Dome and Iron Beam, as well as replacing weapons provided by the DOD.
The bill also grants the authority to supply Israel with equipment and services already available in U.S. stockpiles and permits an increase in the quantity of weapons stored in Israel. Additionally, it earmarks funds to safeguard U.S. embassies and personnel within Israel, as well as facilitate the return of American citizens from the region.

Notably, the legislation discontinues all aid directed toward Gaza, a measure designed to prevent potential diversion to Hamas terrorists. It also draws a line between sharing aid with Ukraine, prohibiting any of the funds to be used for aid to Ukraine.
""The brutal, savage attacks launched by Hamas against our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, have sent shock waves across the world,"" Marshall, leading author of the bill, said in a statement. ""My colleagues and I firmly believe that any aid to Israel should not be used as leverage to send tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine. Any package that does so would result in funds and resources being delayed in Israel's time of need.""

WHITE HOUSE NEGOTIATES COMBINED AID TO ISRAEL AND UKRAINE WITH SENATE
Cruz said ""this bill is about one thing and one thing only: getting our Israeli allies the aid they need, as fast as possible, for as long as it takes them to utterly eradicate Hamas.""
""The overwhelming majority of the Senate is ready to support an aid package for Israel. The House would readily pass this bill—they are frankly not ready to pass anything else, least of all more aid to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. We should pass Israel aid immediately and then move on to those,"" he said.

Vance, a vocal critic of more aid to Ukraine, said assistance to Israel ""should not depend on whether we continue to provide aid to Ukraine.""
""Despite what the president claims, they are unique conflicts that should be handled individually,"" he said.

Lee echoed Vance and added, ""If the Biden administration’s case for additional Ukraine aid is not strong enough to stand on its own, then packaging them is an insulting request to lay before Congress.""
Last week, the Biden administration's Office of Management and Budget sent Congress an emergency supplemental funding package request totaling $106 billion to aid Ukraine, Israel and to speed up asylum processing at the southern border.
The funding proposal includes $61.4 billion for Ukraine, $14.3 billion for Israel (with $10.6 billion allocated for military aid), $13.6 billion for border protection (including measures to combat the flow of fentanyl), and significant investments in Indo-Pacific security assistance, totaling around $7.4 billion. Additionally, there is $9 billion earmarked for humanitarian aid in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza.
Senators will have to agree on a package, with Republicans likely proposing several amendments before it is sent back to Biden’s office for signature.

White House refuses to condemn progressive lawmaker over comments on Hamas’ use of rape,2023-12-04,Fox News,['Thomas Catenacci'],"'The Five' co-hosts discuss 'Squad' member Pramila Jayapal downplaying Hamas' brutality against women on Oct. 7 and women’s groups remaining silent about rape allegations against Israelis.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused Monday to condemn comments from a top progressive lawmaker who called for ""balance"" when condemning Hamas' use of sexual violence against Israeli women.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said ""we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinian"" when asked specifically about mass rape committed by Palestinian militants, during an interview Sunday with CNN. When asked about Jayapal's comments, Jean-Pierre reiterated that using rape as a weapon of war was ""reprehensible,"" but stopped short of condemning the congresswoman.
""I can only speak for the president — that's who I can speak for,"" Jean-Pierre told Fox News correspondent Jacqui Heinrich during the daily White House press briefing Monday. ""We've been clear that what Hamas did is absolutely reprehensible, full stop. We're going to continue to be clear about that.""
""We think rape and the use of rape — being used as a weapon — that is also reprehensible and that's full stop and I'll just leave it there,"" she continued. ""That's speaking for the president of the United States and I think I've been very clear on that.""

While the White House declined to condemn Jayapal, several Democrats blasted her on Monday. For example, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., said it was ""outrageous"" for anyone to ""both sides"" of sexual violence and Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., added that it was ""indecent"" to downplay rape against Israeli women.

"Hamas branded Israeli child hostages in case they escaped, relative says",2023-12-01,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"FOX News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joined 'FOX & Friends' to discuss the disturbing new details as the cease-fire with Israel expires. 
A family member of two Israeli boys released from Hamas captivity this week said they were branded like cattle, among other abuses, in the weeks they were held in Gaza since Oct. 7, according to a report.
Brothers Yagil Yaakov, 12, and Or Yaakov, 16, were freed Wednesday during a temporary cease-fire that saw the release of approximately 110 hostages. Their uncle said the terrorists branded each boy by using the exhaust pipe of a motorcycle to identify them in case they escaped, the Times of Israel reported.
""They told us stories about what they went through inside Gaza. The stories are horrible,"" Yaniv Yaakov said in North Macedonia with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen. ""Each child that was taken by Hamas was taken on a motorbike, and they took every child, took his leg and put it on the exhaust of that motorbike, so they have a burn, so they will be marked if they run, if they escape, so [Hamas] can find them.""
He added, ""They were drugged, they were treated so badly, but at least they are with us.""

Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett confirmed the details of the branding on social media platform X, saying, ""We now know that Hamas terrorists who held hostage 13-year-old Yagel Yaacov and his brother Or, used a boiling hot motorcycle exhaust to ‘imprint’ a burn on their legs as a way to identify them if they try to escape.""
""Let me repeat: They took a boiling piece of metal and pinned it to the legs of a helpless 13-year-old captive child,"" he added.

The gruesome account out of Gaza is the latest in a growing list of stories of torture and torment revealed by Israeli children released during the temporary cease-fire and the Israeli hostage-for-Palestinian prisoner exchange.
Vivian Hadar, the aunt of Mia Schem, 21, who was freed Thursday, said her young niece was taken from the Nova music festival, where she was shot in the arm. She had to endure the pain of the gunshot wound while she was being held hostage, only receiving treatment from a Palestinian veterinarian, the Times of Israel reported.

Hamas militants released eight more Israeli hostages and three bodies Thursday as a cease-fire with Israel was expected to expire. 
The Israeli military said six Israeli hostages had been released from captivity in the Gaza Strip and transferred to Egypt by the Red Cross late Thursday. They arrived hours after two additional hostages were turned over to Israel separately.
From Egypt, the newly freed hostages were to be transferred to Israel to be reunited with their families after nearly eight weeks in captivity.

October 30 | Israel continues to expand its war against Hamas in Gaza | Live Updates from Fox News Digital,2023-10-31,Fox News,[],"incoming update…
Coverage for this event has ended.


The Israeli Defense Forces and Israeli Securities Authority said troops killed Nasim Abu Ajina, the Hamas commander who they say directed the part of the Oct. 7 massacre in the Kibbutz Erez and Moshav Netiv HaAsara.

""Yesterday, based on IDF and ISA intelligence, IDF fighter jets struck the Commander of the Beit Lahia Battalion of Hamas' Northern Brigade, Nasim Abu Ajina, who directed the massacre on October 7th in the Kibbutz Erez and Moshav Netiv HaAsara,"" the IDF and ISA said in a joint statement. ""In the past, Abu Ajina commanded Hamas' Aerial Array, and took part in the development of the UAVs and paragliders of the terrorist organization.""
""His elimination significantly harms the efforts of the Hamas terrorist organization to disrupt the IDF's ground activities,"" the statement added.
More than 9,400 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel since Hamas launched its largest attack against Israel in decades on Oct. 7, leading to retaliatory action from Israeli forces. Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.
U.S. forces in western Iraq were targeted in another drone attack early Tuesday morning, according to a report, marking the latest in a string of assaults on American troops in the Middle East as the Israel-Hamas war continues.

Two armed drones were used against Iraq’s Ain al-Asad airbase, Reuters reported, citing a security source and a government source. The base hosts international troops that assist Iraq in defeating a terror group called the Daesh, or the Islamic State. No casualties or damage were reported.
Tuesday's attack would be the 25th on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. The attacks have included a mix of one-way drones and rockets, resulting in the death of an American contractor and 24 injured troops, according to U.S. defense officials.
The attacks have increased in recent weeks as President Biden and other senior leaders continue to express support for Israel and its right to defend itself after one of the worst terror attacks in decades left more than 1,400 people dead, including 34 Americans.

According to Reuters, a group called the ""Islamic resistance in Iraq"" endorsed the attack, which took place less than 24 hours after another missile attack from the same base in Iraq.
On Monday, five rockets landed a mile away from the al-Asad Air Base.
No injuries to American soldiers or the base were reported. Coalition forces also were not injured.

A prominent Cornell University professor has called on the school’s board of trustees to take action after a series of antisemitic and anti-Israel incidents have left Jewish students feeling uncomfortable and unsafe on campus.
William A. Jacobson, a clinical professor at Cornell Law School who joined the faculty in 2007, called on the Cornell Board of Trustees to pause new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition of antisemitism and form a special independent commission to investigate antisemitism on campus and the negative effects of DEI.

""There has been a long problem at Cornell that the administration has just shut its eyes to. The faculty is extremely anti-Israel, not necessarily the majority of them, but there is a core group of faculty who agitate continuously for the destruction of Israel,"" Jacobson told Fox News Digital.
""They claim it's a colonialist state, even though the Jews are the indigenous people of the land of Israel. They claim that you need to liberate Israel, but who are you going to liberate from the people who have the historical claim to it? But it's nonstop. It's all the time, and that has a very pernicious effect on campus,"" he continued.

""I've heard from a lot of students, and I've seen a lot of chatter that Jewish students in particular are extremely upset. They were extremely upset with the vituperative hostility towards Israel expressed by numerous student groups, expressed by faculty, and they don't feel welcome at Cornell. They feel there's a problem here. And I think the administration needs to get a handle on that.""
On Sunday, it was revealed that Cornell University police are investigating a series of threats made against the school’s Jewish community. The threats were posted to a website not affiliated with the university and targeted ""104 West,"" where the Center of Jewish Living is located on campus. One of the threats called for people to follow a Jewish person home and ""slit their throats,"" adding, ""Rats need to be eliminated from Cornell.""

The head of a United Nations agency said during an emergency meeting Monday that ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions.""
Philippe Lazzarini, the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), warned against additional fighting in Gaza, where Israeli forces are launching a ground invasion to eliminate Hamas, which governs the territory.

Lazzarini warned Israel against the ""collective punishment"" of Palestinians and said a further breakdown of civil order following the looting of the agency’s warehouses by Palestinians searching for food and other aid ""will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the largest U.N. agency in Gaza to continue operating.""
Lazzarini, flanked by the head of the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF and a senior U.N. humanitarian official, provided briefings to the Security Council, where the officials painted a dire picture of the humanitarian situation in Gaza after more than a million people have been displaced. The meeting comes 23 days after Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attacks in Israel that killed over 1,400 people.
According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, which is run by Hamas, more than 8,300 civilians have been killed and tens of thousands have been injured since Israel launched retaliatory military action aimed at ""obliterating"" Hamas.

UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said the death toll includes more than 3,400 children, adding that over 6,300 have been injured.
""This means that more than 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza each day — a number which should shake each of us to our core,"" she said.

Josh Gottheimer, N.J., a ""coward,"" ""punk"" and ""gangster"" for his criticism against lawmakers who voted against a resolution to condemn Hamas and support Israel. Gottheimer, who is Jewish, used the word ""despicable"" to describe Democrats who opposed the resolution.
Fox News Digital reviewed Carson's previous positions on Israel and found several examples of the congressman advocating anti-Israel positions.
In 2015, Carson met with Louis Farrakhan and told media outlets in 2018 he would not rule out meeting with him again in the future.

Farrakhan has  called Jewish people ""termites"", praised Hitler, and been criticized for a litany of derogatory statements about Israel.
Carson has opposed recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as recently as 2017 and in 2019 Carson defended Rep. Ihan Omar when she was accused by House Republicans of antisemitism.



White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday refused to call anti-Israel protestors on college campuses across America ""extremists,"" despite antisemitic rhetoric, violence, and rising fear among Jewish students.
The exchange took place during the White House press briefing when Fox News' Peter Doocy asked Jean-Pierre over whether President Biden saw those protestors as ""extremists.""

""What I can say is — what we've been very clear about this when it comes to antisemitism, there is no place. We have to make sure that we speak against it very loud and be very clear about that,"" Jean-Pierre said, adding that Biden decided to run for president in 2017 as a result of the violent Charlottesville, Virginia protest clash that year.
""He saw neo-Nazis marching down the streets of Charlottesville with vile, anti-Semitic, just hatred. And he was very clear then, and he's very clear now. He's taken actions against this over the past two years. And he's continued to be clear: There is no place, no place for this type of vile — and this kind of rhetoric,"" she said.
Doocy pressed Jean-Pierre, saying, ""We hear you guys though talk about extremists all the time. It is usually about MAGA extremists. So what about these protesters who are making Jewish students feel unsafe on college campuses?""

""I have been very, very clear.  We are calling out any form of hate, any form of hate. It is not acceptable. It should not be acceptable here. And we are going to continue to call that out,"" she said, again refusing to say whether the protestors were ""extremists.""

During a White House meeting, President Biden reportedly blasted The New York Times’ controversial coverage of an explosion near a Gaza Strip hospital.  
A report from Semafor alleged that Biden met with Wall Street executives in the White House’s Roosevelt Room last week and discussed the paper along with its claim that Israel was behind the explosion. He was particularly disturbed such a headline appeared ""in an American newspaper.""
""Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians Say,"" the original New York Times headline read on Oct. 17.

According to Semafor, ""[Biden] thought the headline was irresponsible and could have triggered military escalation in the Middle East."" Within the same day of the headline’s publication and others like it blaming Israel for the blast, prominent Arab leaders canceled their meeting with Biden.
The Times received intense backlash for its headline on Oct. 17 as well as its coverage on the explosion. The story claimed, through information released by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, that Israeli airstrikes caused an explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds. Israel denied the claims and presented evidence that the Palestinian Islamic Jihad was behind the blast. U.S. intelligence confirmed that Israel was not behind the explosion.
The Times soon released a lengthy editor’s note apologizing for its reliance on unverified claims by Hamas.

Israeli ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan invoked the Holocaust during a bitter condemnation of the UN Security Council's response to the October 7 terrorist attacks on Monday.

Erdan delivered the critical remarks at an emergency meeting requested by the United Arab Emirates. He accused the council of being silent about Hamas' attacks against Israelis, likening it to the international ignorance of the Holocaust during World War II.
""Today, after innocent Jewish babies were burned alive, this Council is still silent. Some of you have learned nothing in the past 80 years,"" Erdan argued. ""Some of you have forgotten why this body was established.""
""Instead of shouting ‘Sieg Heil,’ these radical Nazi Islamists scream, ‘Death to Israel! Death to America! Death to England!’"" he added. ""We were attacked by the Hamas Nazis. We were shown that genocidal Jew-hatred did not die with Hitler, it bubbled and grew, until it invaded our homeland.""
The ambassador also announced that he will wear a yellow star until the council explicitly condemns Hamas.

""Just like my grandparents, and the grandparents of millions of Jews, from now on, my team and I will wear yellow stars. We will wear this star until you wake up and condemn the atrocities of Hamas,"" Erdan said. ""We will walk with a yellow star as a symbol of pride. A reminder that we swore to fight back to defend ourselves.""

Israeli citizens in the North Caucasus are urged by their country's government to leave the region after the Makhachkala airport riot took place on Sunday.
The Israeli government raised its travel warning to the area to the highest level, 4, on Monday. They ask citizens to avoid Dagestan, where the riot took place, and neighboring regions. Israelis currently in the regions are urged to leave.
The airport in Makhachkala, located in southwestern Russia, was stormed by hundreds of men on Sunday night. Many were carrying Palestinian flags, while others were yelling antisemitic slogans.

Russian news sources reported that the men were looking for a flight that was due to land from Tel Aviv. Police arrested over 60 men, and at least 20 people were injured.

Law enforcement officials arrested a Las Vegas man who allegedly threatened a Jewish U.S. senator, as antisemitism in the U.S. is on the rise amid the Israel-Hamas war.
In a criminal complaint, the Department of Justice accused John Anthony Miller, 43, of leaving several threatening voicemails on the office phone of Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev.
Rosen, who is Jewish, received the voicemails between October 11 and 19.

In one of the voicemails, Miller allegedly asked Rosen if she had any family members who were Israeli settlers.
""She lets her own family members kill these Pe-Palestinians in the West Bank. The Christians in the West Bank,"" Miller reportedly said in the voicemail.

The White House condemned the anti-Semitic riot in Makhachkala, Russia, in which a group of rioters flooded the city airport's runway on Sunday looking for an Israeli flight.
The riot forced officials to close the airport and divert flights that were headed to Makhachkala, which is in the Republic of Dagestan. Young men in the riot were heard yelling ""Allahu Akbar"" and making disparaging remarks about Jews.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby compared the chaos to the anti-Jewish pogroms of the 19th and 20th centuries. He made the statement on Monday, after press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre referenced anti-Semitism on U.S. college campuses in a briefing.
""I just want to add just one little thought here on top of Karine's excellent comments on anti-Semitism,"" the official began. ""I think you all saw what happened in Dagestan, Russia yesterday in what can only be described as a chilling demonstration of hate, bigotry, intimidation.""

""Some people have compared it to the pogroms of the late 19th and early 20th century, and I think that's probably an apt description given that video that we've seen out there,"" Kirby added.

U.S. forces in the Middle East have been attacked for the 24th time since October 17, amid the war between the Israeli military and Hamas terrorists.
The attack, which was announced on Monday afternoon, took place close to the Asad Air Base in Iraq. American defense officials say that five rockets landed roughly a mile away from the base.
No injuries to American soldiers or the base were reported. Coalition forces also were not injured.
A U.S. official emphasized that the rockets were not significant threats to the American military.
Iran-backed militias have been claiming the recent attacks against American forces. Last week, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq took responsibility for an attack at the al-Tanf garrison in Syria.
The U.S. military responded by launching airstrikes on facilities belonging to Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other militants in Syria in Thursday.

Shani Louk, the German-Israeli woman whose semi-naked body was seen paraded through the streets of Gaza, was beheaded, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officials believe.

Louk was believed to be one of the living hostages that Hamas terrorists captured during the Re'im musical festival massacre on October 7.
""We are devastated to share that the body of 23-year-old German-Israeli Shani Luk [sic] was found and identified,"" the Israeli government wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday morning. ""Shani, who was kidnapped from a music festival and tortured and paraded around Gaza by Hamas terrorists, experienced unfathomable horrors. Our hearts are broken. May her memory be a blessing.""
Israeli officials concluded that she was beheaded after they identified a skull with a DNA match.

Warning: This story contains graphic details that may be disturbing to some readers.
Israeli officials are still struggling to identify the remains of those killed by Hamas terrorists, as the country's war against the militant group continues into its fourth week.

Authorities say that the reason is not just because of the massive scope of the attacks that began on October 7, but the sheer brutality of how terrorists murdered civilians.
""During a war, each side tries to make a convincing argument that they are right but these kinds of atrocities we have not seen since the days of the Nazis,"" Col. Rabbi Haim Weisberg, head of the Shura Army Base's rabbinic division, said in an interview. 
""They went from house to house burning family after family,"" he explained. ""We are seeing trucks still arriving filled with body bags that contain whole families – grandparents, mothers, fathers, and even little children are being brought down from the trucks."" 
""Here we have identified hundreds of bodies and there are still many more waiting to be examined,"" the rabbi said.

Netanyahu rejects calls for ceasfire with Hamas: 'This is a time for war'


Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu flatly rejected calls for a cease-fire in comments to the press on Monday.
Netanyahu compared the October 7 massacre by Hamas to the Pearl Harbor and 9-11 attacks on the U.S., saying Israel is equally justified in retaliating against Hamas terrorists in Gaza. He went on to say that Israel will continue its war against Hamas ""until victory.""
""Calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen,"" Netanyahu said.

""Ladies and gentlement, the Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war. This is a time for war. A war for our common future,"" he continued. ""Today we draw a line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism. It is a time for everyone to decide where they stand. Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until victory. I hope and pray that civilized nations everywhere will back this fight.""
Israeli forces entered the second stage of their conflict with Hamas this week, greatly expanding ground operations within the Gaza strip. Military officials have warned that the war will be long and difficult.

Israel-Hamas war: Oil prices could see 'large increases' if conflict spreads, World Bank warns


The World Bank is warning Monday that the prices of oil and other commodities could see ""large increases"" if the Israel-Hamas war spreads through the Middle East.
The Washington-based institution said in its October 2023 Commodity Markets Outlook report that despite commodity markets responding ""calmly"" to the war, ""historical precedent"" suggests that escalating conflict in the region could substantially disrupt commodity supply.

""Although neither Israel nor Gaza is a major energy producer, an escalation of the conflict and its spread to the wider region could lead to large increases in the prices of oil and other commodities,"" the report says. ""Historical precedent also indicates this could have destabilizing implications for the global economy. Moreover, spillovers to food prices could exacerbate food insecurity in conflict-afflicted areas in the region and around the world.""
If that happens, depending on the level of impact to the global oil supply, the World Bank says prices per barrel could rise from the 2023 Q4 baseline forecast of $90 a barrel to around $102 in a ""small disruption scenario"" to as much as $157 a barrel in a ""large disruption scenario.""

California professors claim condemning Hamas terrorism makes Palestinian students 'unsafe'

Ethnic studies professors demanded the University of California stop referring to Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians as ""terrorism,"" arguing in a letter to administrators that such language endangers students.

""We call on the UC administrative leadership to retract its charges of terrorism, to uplift the Palestinian freedom struggle, and to stand against Israel’s war crimes against and ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Palestinian people,"" a statement from the University of California Ethnic Studies Faculty Council reads in part.
Hamas terrorists launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, firing thousands of rockets and slaying civilians in the streets. At least 1,400 Israeli citizens and 33 Americans were killed. Israel's retaliatory strikes have killed more than 7,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.
At least 10 Americans may be among the 239 people held hostage by Hamas.
UC leaders condemned the ""horrific attack"" in a statement on Oct. 9, calling it an ""act of terrorism"" and highlighting the ""loss of many innocent lives and the abduction of innocent hostages, including children and the elderly.""

But the UC Ethnic Studies Faculty Council said administrators' use of the terms ""terrorism"" and ""unprovoked"" have stoked anti-Muslim sentiments and ""made Palestinian students and community members unsafe."" The group cited the recent stabbing death of a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy in Illinois.

IDF strikes inside Lebanon after missiles hit Israeli territory

Israeli Defense Forces say they struck at a terrorist cell in Lebanon that had been firing mortars into Israel on Monday.

IDF Spokesman Daniel Hagari announced the attack Monday on social media, saying the terror cell fired three anti-tank missiles. The missiles caused no casualties, however, and the IDF responded with artillery fire of their own.
""IDF forces attacked a terrorist cell in Lebanese territory a short time ago, which tried to launch mortar bombs towards Israel in the area of ​​Rosh Hankara,"" Hagari wrote.
""Also, following the initial report of a warning in Moshav Elkosh, two missiles were identified that crossed into Israeli territory and fell in open areas,"" he added.

Biden admin announces effort to combat antisemitism on college campuses after GOP outcry

President Biden's administration is moving to combat the ""alarming rise"" of anti-semitism at U.S. college campuses this week.
The move comes after weeks of anti-Israeli and pro-Hamas protests at campuses across the U.S., leading to demands for action from Republicans.The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security has begun hosting calls with campus and local law enforcement across the country.
Later this week, the White House says Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden will attend a site visit at a University and hold a roundtable with Jewish students. The administration did not clarify which school, however.

Jewishs students across the country have faced a spike in threats since Hamas carried out its massacre in Israel on October 7.
Jewish students at New York City College were locked inside a school library last week during a pro-Palestinian protest. That same night, pro-Palestinian protesters projected the messages ""Glory to our Martyrs"" and ""Your Tuition is Funding Genocide in Gaza"" on George Washington University’s library in Washington, D.C.

The most extreme anti-Israel, Hamas-sympathizing moments on college campuses since the Oct. 7 attack

Since the Oct. 7 attacks committed by Hamas against Israel, protests have broken out across the world seemingly supporting the terror group and condemning the Jewish State, which is still reeling from the murder of over 1,400 Israelis.

But perhaps the most extreme displays from the Hamas-sympathizing supporters are coming from American college campuses.
Here are some examples of the jarring actions and rhetoric coming from both students and professors alike.
More than 30 student groups at Harvard co-signed a letter declaring they ""hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.""
New York University students were caught tearing down posters of Israeli hostages Oct. 16 outside the university's Tisch Hall.
University of California-Davis assistant professor Jemma Decristo had an ominous message appearing to threaten what she called ""Zionist journalists"" and their families.

US 'vigorously condemns' pro-Palestinian rioters who stormed Russian airport searching for Israelis

The White House said Sunday it ""vigorously condemns"" the group of pro-Palestinian rioters in Russia who flooded an airport as they were shouting antisemitic chants and reportedly searching for passengers from a flight that departed from Tel Aviv, Israel.
The airport, located in the city of Makhachkala in the Republic of Dagestan, closed after rioters began flooding the runway Sunday night, Russian aviation authority Rosaviatsia reported. All other flights headed toward Makhachkala were diverted.
In the first public comment made by the Biden administration since the incident, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the U.S. condemns the ""antisemitic protests"" at the airport in Russia.

""The United States vigorously condemns the antisemitic protests in Dagestan, Russia,"" Watson wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The U.S. unequivocally stands with the entire Jewish community as we witness a worldwide surge in antisemitism. There is never any excuse or justification for antisemitism.""
Many users on X blasted Watson's post for referring to the riot as a ""protest,"" with some people replying that the correct term would be ""pogrom,"" which means attacks on particular ethnic groups, particularly Jewish people.

Terrifying things we in East Palestine still don’t know since train derailment,2023-10-05,Fox News,['Susan Reynolds'],"Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on cleanup efforts seven months after the catastrophe on 'Special Report.'
Since a train derailment this past February that spewed a million pounds of toxic chemicals that were subsequently set ablaze, we the people living and working in East Palestine, Ohio, are caught in an eerily similar nightmare that happened to the residents of Times Beach, Missouri, roughly 50 years ago.
In 1972, town officials in Times Beach hired a contractor to spray oil on the dirt roads to suppress dust, a common practice at the time. However, no one was aware that the oil used was contaminated with dioxin from an Agent Orange manufacturer. 
Dioxin is a dangerous chemical that, once absorbed, can remain in the human body for more than 10 years and can cause cancer, reproductive and developmental problems, damage to the immune system, and hormone interference.
A black plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, as a result of a controlled detonation of a portion of the derailed Norfolk Southern trains, Feb. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, file)
In addition to the town, the contractor sprayed some 25 other locations with the dioxin-contaminated mixture. People at those sites soon became sick with headaches, nosebleeds, diarrhea, stomach pain and skin rashes. Some 75 horses died at two arenas that had been sprayed. In 1974, a CDC investigation of the arenas confirmed dioxin in the soil.
EAST PALESTINE RESIDENTS GRILL BIDEN FOR NOT YET VISITING SITE OF MAJOR TRAIN DERAILMENT: ‘WE’RE NOT OK'
Sadly, it took the federal government – pushed by determined townspeople – nearly 10 years to recognize that Times Beach was also dangerously contaminated. In 1982, the Times Beach city clerk reportedly was alerted by a journalist who had uncovered official documents suspecting the town was contaminated. 
Taken by surprise, town officials asked the EPA to test, but were told it might be a year before that could happen. Residents joined together and raised money to have the testing done themselves. When the EPA learned this, it suddenly announced it would test immediately, too.
Imagine being a resident or business owner in Times Beach during this decade-long period. You know something is just not right. People have mysterious symptoms. Animals are dying. No one has any answers as to why, nor is there seemingly any sense of urgency to find out.
Shortly after testing was completed in early December 1982, a nearby river flooded the town. A few days later, the test paid for by residents came back positive for dioxin. On Dec. 23, the EPA’s own results confirmed dioxin levels were 300 times higher than what’s considered safe. Fearing the flood had spread the dioxin further, the federal government bought out the residents and the town abandoned.
In East Palestine, it’s now eight months since the train derailment and chemical spill that was set ablaze, resulting in a mile-high, toxic plume that poisoned the air, water and soil in communities within a 30-mile radius, and many people report the same mysterious symptoms that the people of Times Beach experienced. Most worrisome, we are coping with anxiety over potential long-term exposure to toxic chemicals.
OFFICIALS REVEAL BEHIND-THE-SCENES DECISION TO VENT TOXIC CHEMICALS AFTER EAST PALESTINE TRAIN DERAILMENT
One would think the EPA learned a valuable lesson since 1972. Yet, the agency refuses to test the air inside of our homes and businesses. I am also not aware of any ongoing EPA testing being done on private well water, which is a concern because it takes time for contaminated surface water to leech into underground aquifers.
Testing is expensive, nevertheless some independent groups have started conducting their own. One such soil test in May showed toxic chemical levels near the derailment site up to 900 times higher than in outlying areas. Urine tests came back positive for vinyl chloride and benzene. 
Last month, a local doctor took video of chemicals in a creek that runs through town. He also took creek samples to a lab and the test results showed elevated levels of isopropyl benzene and methylcyclohexane – both incredibly dangerous chemicals.
Meanwhile, there are thousands of homes and businesses within the affected area. We need air purifiers, now, to remove the toxins that have no doubt made their way inside. A grassroots group led by a local church has created a fundraising campaign to get the air purifiers. 
Similarly, residents with private wells need bottled water, since the mayor advised that no one should drink the water anytime soon because of contamination concerns.
EAST PALESTINE RESIDENT EXPERIENCING LESIONS, STOMACH PAIN, SHORTNESS OF BREATH SINCE TRAIN DERAILMENT
We are all anxious, but what’s truly terrifying is not knowing what’s lurking in the air, water and soil around our homes and businesses. 
As we have learned, contaminated water outside can easily leach chemicals inside. Contaminated dust outside is constantly moved around by wind and trucks and easily makes its way inside. We don’t know what tomorrow will bring. Are we going to get cancer?
The EPA must test the air inside homes and places of work, as well as regular water testing. President Biden’s executive order last week confirmed that he is not planning on declaring a federal disaster here anytime soon, as our governor, Mike DeWine, had asked.

The order did set an extended timeline for further investigation, but this just means a lot more waiting with no direct relief for the people affected by this disaster.
In the meantime, we need interim help in the form of air purifiers and bottled water. We can’t wait a decade, like Times Beach, Missouri, to find out we are living and working in the next Superfund site and must abandon our town.

Hamas militants were told by their commanders to behead and step on the heads of civilians, the Israeli Military said, citing an interrogation of a Hamas militant reviewed by Fox News.
The Hamas militant said they became animals during the Oct. 7 attack, doing things that humans don't do.
According to the Israeli military
, the Hamas militant said that videos of the attack were shared in a Telegram group during the Oct. 7 attack while people were still being killed.
Some of the details shared by the Hamas militant are too graphic to describe.

An Israeli soldier celebrated his wedding Tuesday, a little over a week after he was wounded battling Hamas terrorists and his younger brother was declared missing in action.
Amid grief and uncertainty, Yonatan and Galya Tzvi, both 24, tied the knot in a scaled-down ceremony that had been planned months before Hamas terrorists stormed into Israel Oct. 7 and slaughtered more than 1,400 people.
""It was obviously a very bittersweet wedding and there were tears,"" the groom's father, Rabbi Doron Perez, told Fox News Digital. ""But somehow we were able to celebrate, and it was also very happy.""
When fighting broke out, Yonatan, a soldier in a paratrooper brigade, was dispatched to Sderot then to an army base in Nahal Oz, less than two miles from the border with Gaza.

Hamas terrorists had breached the security fence and taken over the army base.
Yonatan's 22-year-old brother Daniel, a tank commander, happened to be stationed there when fighting broke out.
""When [Yonatan] went into the base, some of the tanks were missing. He knew where Daniel’s tank was parked, and it wasn't there,"" Doron said.

Two astronauts aboard the International Space Station told Fox News their view of Earth without borders and living alongside people from other nations has helped them feel a sense of unity, even as the Israel-Hamas war rages.
""One of the things we experience up here is a different perspective of the world of our planet,"" European Space Agency astronaut Andreas Mogensen told Fox News. ""A lot of people call it the overview effect.""
""We see the Earth as a single planet that we all share together,"" he continued. ""You don't see borders between countries, and so you get an idea that perhaps borders are something artificial.""

Though astronauts may not be able to differentiate between different countries from space, territorial border disputes over the Gaza Strip between Palestinians and Israelis have been ongoing for decades. After Hamas — the ruling party in Gaza — invaded Israel and murdered over 1,400 Israelis on Oct. 7, the Jewish nation declared war on the Islamic terrorist group and launched retaliatory strikes.
""There's much more that unifies us,"" NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbel told Fox News. ""In addition to seeing our Earth from the very unique vantage point that we have, we also have a very international crew up here.""

Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he would rescind student visas of foreign nationals in the U.S. and send them back to their home countries if they expressed support for Hamas terrorists' attack against Israel.

Speaking at a campaign event in Iowa on Friday, the White House hopeful discussed his plans to remove Hamas-supporting foreign nationals attending U.S. colleges and universities from the country as many pro-Palestinian student groups at various institutions across the nation release statements and organize demonstrations endorsing Hamas' largest attack against Israel in decades.
""You see students demonstrating in our country in favor of Hamas,"" DeSantis said. ""Remember, some of them are foreigners.""
DeSantis said he will be ""canceling your visa, and I’m sending you home"" if he wins the presidency in 2024.
More than 5,700 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel since Hamas' attack against Israel on October 7, leading to retaliatory action from Israeli forces. Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.

Former Israel-based NBC News correspondent Martin Fletcher reacted to the news Friday that two of his wife's relatives who had been taken hostage by Hamas were released.
""My wife has been in touch with her family directly in Israel,"" Fletcher said Friday on MSNBC. ""And she's been told that the hostages are now with the Red Cross in Israel. And that's as much as we know.""

""Obviously a huge sigh of relief,"" Fletcher later said, ""and at the same time concerned that there's so many more hostages. And the question being, is this the beginning of a prisoner swap of some kind?""
Fletcher explained that the American mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan of Evanston, Ill., are distant cousins of his wife but that they are part of a ""tight-knit family.""
""I can tell you one thing, the family's rallied around them in an extraordinary manner hoping that this would happen. And the fact that it actually happened as a miracle,"" Fletcher said.
The veteran journalist, who previously served as NBC News' Tel Aviv bureau chief, speculated that Hamas ""suddenly"" releasing two American hostages could indicate a ""calculated"" decision about a potential prisoner swap. 
However, Fletcher also revealed he still has a relative among the remaining hostages as his family buried another relative who was murdered in the Oct. 7 attacks.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced steps to increase the posture of the armed forces after recent escalations by Iran in the Middle East and Hamas terrorists' attack on Israel.

""Following detailed discussions with President Biden on recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces across the Middle East Region, today I directed a series of additional steps to further strengthen the Department of Defense posture in the region,"" Austin wrote in a statement. ""These steps will bolster regional deterrence efforts, increase force protection for U.S. forces in the region, and assist in the defense of Israel.""
This comes after more than 5,700 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel since Hamas terrorists launched their largest attack against Israel in decades on October 7, leading to retaliatory action from Israeli forces. Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.

""First, I redirected the movement of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group to the Central Command area of responsibility,"" Austin wrote. ""This carrier strike group is in addition to the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, which is currently operating in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. It will further increase our force posture and strengthen our capabilities and ability to respond to a range of contingencies.""
""I have also activated the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery as well as additional Patriot battalions to locations throughout the region to increase force protection for U.S. forces,"" he continued. ""Finally, I have placed an additional number of forces on prepare to deploy orders as part of prudent contingency planning, to increase their readiness and ability to quickly respond as required.""

The secretary concluded, ""I will continue to assess our force posture requirements in the region and consider deploying additional capabilities as necessary.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani on Saturday and thanked them for their efforts in securing the release of two American hostages by Hamas.
""Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke today with Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Secretary Blinken thanked Prime Minister Al Thani for Qatar’s important assistance in securing the release of two Americans held hostage by Hamas. They discussed efforts to secure the immediate and safe return of all hostages and reaffirmed the strategic partnership between the United States and Qatar,"" a readout of the call states.


The United States drafted a United Nations Security Council resolution stating that Israel has the right to defend itself and also calls for Iran to stop exporting arms to ""militias and terrorist groups threatening peace and security across the region.""
According to Reuters, the draft text calls for protecting civilians and states that nations must comply with international law when responding to terrorist attacks. It also urges the  ""continuous, sufficient and unhindered"" aid delivery to the Gaza Strip.
It's unknown when or if the United States will put the resolution up for a vote.

The draft resolution comes after the U.S. vetoed a Brazilian resolution on Wednesday that called for humanitarian pauses in the Israel-Hamas war to allow aid into Gaza.
Reuters contributed to this report.
Arab and Western representatives failed to agree on a statement condemning Hamas for the terrorist attack on Oct 7, according to the Times of Israel.
Lior Haiat, spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign affairs, blasted the summit in a post on X.



""Saturday, October 7th, was a wakeup call to the world to fight terrorism together. The Islamist terror threat does not only endanger Israel, it endangers the states of the region and the whole world,"" Haiat said. ""It is unfortunate that even when faced with those horrific atrocities, there were some who had difficulty condemning terrorism or acknowledging the danger. Israel will do what it has to do and expects the international community to recognize the righteous battle.""
According to Reuters, Arab leaders at the summit condemned Israel's response to the attack.


President Biden was briefed on developments in Israel and Gaza on Saturday, according to the White House.

""President Biden was briefed this afternoon by his national security team via phone on the latest developments in Israel and Gaza. Participants in the briefing include Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer,"" a White House spokesperson said.

Dozens of Hollywood A-listers composed an open letter addressed to President Biden this week urging him and other world leaders to push for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.
Celebrities including Academy Award winner Joaquin Phoenix, actress Cate Blanchett, comedian Jon Stewart, and 52 others signed the letter calling for peace between the Israeli and Palestinian people. 

As noted in Variety, their letter stated, ""We ask that, as President of the United States, you call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the last week and a half – a number any person of conscience knows is catastrophic. We believe all life is sacred, no matter faith or ethnicity and we condemn the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians.""
The letter continued, ""We urge your administration, and all world leaders, to honor all of the lives in the Holy Land and call for and facilitate a ceasefire without delay – an end to the bombing of Gaza, and the safe release of hostages.""
As of Friday, there are 203 Israelis still held hostage by Hamas militants since the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel. Eleven Americans are still unaccounted for since the attack, most likely captured by the terror group.

Other celebrities who signed the letter to the Biden administration include actors Kristen Stewart, Susan Sarandon, Riz Ahmed, and Mahershala Ali.
They added, ""As of this writing more than 6,000 bombs have been dropped on Gaza in the last 12 days — resulting in one child being killed every 15 minutes.""
The non-profit organization ""Artist 4 Ceasefire"" put together the message and asked UNICEF spokesperson James Elder to add a comment, which stressed the humanitarian crisis that Israel is inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza as the nation builds it war effort against Hamas.
Elder wrote, ""Children and families in Gaza have practically run out of food, water, electricity, medicine and safe access to hospitals, following days of air strikes and cuts to all supply routes. Gaza’s sole power plant ran out of fuel Wednesday afternoon, shutting down electricity, water and wastewater treatment.""

""The humanitarian situation has reached lethal lows, and yet all reports point to further attacks. Compassion — and international law — must prevail,"" he added. 
Other prominent U.K. actors have called out Israel for exacerbating the current crisis. Actress Tilda Swinton and others – under the banner ""Artists for Palestine UK"" – signed a letter accusing world governments allied with Israel of ""aiding and abetting"" the Jewish state’s ""war crimes"" in Israel. 
Recently actress Juliana Margulies took a strong stance of support for Israel following the deadly attack earlier this month, blasting those in Hollywood who are not speaking out against the current wave of antisemitism.

Commenting on this alleged silence, Margulies told Variety, ""I don’t understand. It is shocking.""
Fox News Digital reached out to Artists 4 Ceasefire for comment on the letter, though the organization has yet to respond.

President Biden said that the first convoy of humanitarian assistance was delivered to the Gaza Strip.

""Today, the first convoy of humanitarian assistance since Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attack on Israel crossed the border into Gaza and reached Palestinians in need.  The opening of this essential supply route was the result of days of diplomatic engagement at the highest levels. I made it clear from the outset of this crisis--in both my public statements and private conversations--that humanitarian assistance was a critical and urgent need that had to get moving, and I express my deep personal appreciation for the leadership of President Al-Sisi of Egypt, Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, and the United Nations to allow the resumption of this assistance,"" Biden said in a statement.
""The United States
 remains committed to ensuring that civilians in Gaza will continue to have access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance, without diversion by Hamas. We will continue to work with all parties to keep the Rafah crossing in operation to enable the continued movement of aid that is imperative to the welfare of the people of Gaza, and to continue working to protect civilians, consistent with obligations under international humanitarian law,"" he added. ""We also continue to work around the clock, in partnership with Egypt and Israel, to facilitate the ability of U.S. citizens and their immediate family members to exit Gaza safely and travel via Egypt to their final destinations.""


A spokesperson for Israel's military says it will increase attacks on the Gaza Strip beginning Saturday to prepare for the next stage of the war with Hamas.
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters that its trying to create optimal conditions for a possible ground invasion
“We will deepen our attacks to minimize the dangers to our forces in the next stages of the war. We are going to increase the attacks, from today,” Hagari said.
Hagari also repeated calls for Gaza City residents to move south for their safety.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is calling for an international peace summit to end the violence between Israel and Hamas. 
Speaking at a conference in Cairo on Saturday, Abbas reiterated his “complete rejection of the killing of civilians on both sides.” He also urged the “release of all civilians, prisoners, and detainees,” likely alluding to some 210 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and the Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Abbas leads the Palestinian Authority, a government exercising semi-autonomous control in the West Bank. The government is deeply loathed among Palestinians, who view it as corrupt and collaborationist with Israel.
Hamas, which the State Department designates a terrorist group, seized control of the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip in 2007 and is widely supported in the West Bank.

Other Arab leaders spoke at the Cairo conference, calling for more humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza and condemning Israel's bombardment of the Palestinian territory.
Jordan's King Abdullah accused Israel of committing war crimes by targeting civilian infrastructure. Israel has said Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields and that anywhere where rockets are being launched is a legitimate military target. 
The office of Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sissi said the international response to Israel's ""killing of innocent people"" has fallen short.
“While we see one place officials rushing and competing to promptly condemn the killing of innocent people, we find incomprehensible hesitation in denouncing the same act in another place,” it said in reference to fierce Western condemnation of Hamas’ attack on Israel and a weaker reaction to Palestinian suffering.
The Associated Press contributed to this update.


HBO host Bill Maher skewered America’s Ivy League universities Friday night, accusing them of being hotbeds of ""indoctrination"" after many student groups have been hammering Israel in the wake of Hamas’ deadly attack against that country.

Citing antisemitic rallies and statements cropping up in academia following the attack, the ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" host advised that young people should avoid attending these schools.
At the outset of the segment, Maher stated, ""As an Ivy League graduate who knows the value of a liberal education, I have one piece of advice for the youth of America: Don’t go to college.""
Showing images of Pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel demonstrations at Harvard University, the comedian continued, ""And if you absolutely have to go, don’t go to an elite college, because as recent events have shown, it just makes you stupid.""
Maher stated that the tragedy in Israel revealed ""how higher education has become indoctrination into a stew of bad ideas, among them the simplistic notion that the world is a binary place where everyone is either an oppressor or oppressed, in the case of Israel, oppressors being babies and bubbes.""

The Philadelphia Inquirer recently apologized for publishing an editorial cartoon pushing ""antisemitic tropes.""

The Philadelphia Inquirer apologized for publishing an editorial cartoon that pushed ""antisemitic tropes"" this week.
The editorial board for the big city paper put out a piece expressing regret for posting cartoonist Monte Wolverton’s illustration on Tuesday. The cartoon criticized Israel’s response to Hamas’ murder of around 1300 people in the Jewish state.

""It is clear this cartoon was highly insensitive, particularly at the current moment when antisemitism is on the rise. We hear the outcry and apologize for the pain it caused,"" the editorial declared.
The image created by the Cagle Cartoons-syndicated artist depicted a massive black military boot emblazoned with a Star of David about to step on a crowd of Palestinians that contained multiple Hamas militants scattered throughout. 
A speech bubble attributed to the boot wearer – a representation of the Jewish state about to crush its enemy – stated, ""Distance yourselves!"" The crowd of Palestinians and Hamas militants was drawn scattering under the approaching boot, which appeared poised to crush most of the people depicted.

Wolverton had shared the drawing to social media platform X, where many users rebuked the image. One posted, ""This cartoon is shameful,"" another claimed, ""Monte supports baby killers,"" and someone else stated, ""Nice moral relativism, you antisemitic piece of trash.""
The Wednesday editorial stated, ""The Inquirer Editorial Board regrets the publication of an editorial cartoon by Monte Wolverton of the Cagle Cartoons syndicate that appeared in Tuesday’s editions.""
The board admitted, ""In hindsight, the cartoon depicting an oversized Israeli military boot stepping on Hamas terrorists hiding among civilians in response to the Oct. 7 attack should not have been published.""
It also claimed, ""Regardless of the interpretation, the illustration reinforces pernicious antisemitic tropes about Israeli aggression.""

A senior Israel Defense Forces official says the military will try not to target areas in Gaza where humanitarian aid is being delivered, unless Hamas fires rockets from them.

“It’s a safe zone. We have a system which every time we decide that an area … is a safe zone, we declare no attack in this area. We won’t attack them,” the official told reporters, according to the Associated Press.
He added that the definition of what constitutes a “legitimate target” has changed, because the use of civilian infrastructure by Hamas “turns a private home into a legitimate target. And anyone who supports that home is a legitimate target.”
The official acknowledged that IDF has struck houses where civilians were living among terrorists.
Earlier, at least 12 Palestinians were killed by an Israeli airstrike that hit a house in central Gaza, according to witnesses at the scene.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday welcomed the first delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip since the Israel-Hamas war started on October 7. 

“With this convoy, the international community is beginning to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that has left residents of Gaza without access to sufficient food, water, medical care, and safe shelter,” Blinken said in a statement.
“We urge all parties to keep the Rafah crossing open to enable the continued movement of aid that is imperative to the welfare of the people of Gaza” he added, emphasizing that Hamas ""must not interfere with the provision of this life-saving assistance."" 
Blinken said the U.S, was still working with Israel and Egypt to arrange for dual U.S. citizens to be able to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing. Many Palestinians with foreign passports are gathered at the crossing, but have not yet been allowed to cross.

Some Jewish students at Georgetown Law School say they're facing threatening anti-Israeli rhetoric from classmates and from outside groups that are being promoted on the Washington, D.C. campus. 

The hostile rhetoric includes what appears to be a globally orchestrated antisemitic campaign that the students fear will incite physical violence on campus as war escalates between Israelis and Palestinians. 
""Knowing you're sitting in class next to someone who advocates the destruction of Israel is frightening,"" Julia Wax, a first-year Georgetown Law student from San Diego, California, told Fox News Digital.
She and other law school students recently formed the Georgetown Law Zionists as a show of resolve in response to the threats. 
""Because it's law school, people here are nuanced with their hate,"" Wax said.

The group is concerned that administrators have failed to publicly condemn violent, antisemitic and anti-Zionist language that is being shared by other students or shouted at events and protests promoted on campus.
Last weekend at Franklin Park, about a mile from campus, protesters chanted, ""We don’t want no Jewish state. We want '48.""
The demonstration was promoted by law school students and attended by classmates, too, the Georgetown Law Zionists claim.
""When we hear that, we hear that they want the extermination of Jews,"" said Wax. ""They don't want peace in Israel at all. They want to eliminate or displace 6 million Jewish people.""

The father of two American hostages who were released by Hamas on Friday spoke out after their safe return. 
Uri Ranaan, of Illinois, told reporters he had ""no idea"" why Hamas decided to release his wife, Judith, and their 17-year-old daughter, Natalie. 
""I think it's a matter of luck, I have no idea,"" he said.  

The 71-year-old told the Associated Press he was overjoyed at their freedom and that both were doing well. Judith and Natalie are currently in the care of the Israelis and Raanan said they should both be back in the United States early next week. 
An Israeli army spokesperson told the AP the two Americans were out of the Gaza Strip and with the Israeli military. Hamas said Friday it released them for humanitarian reasons in an agreement with the Qatari government.
They were the first hostages to be released since Hamas militants, according to Israel, abducted roughly 200 people during their Oct. 7 rampage.
Asked if he had a message for other families of hostages, Ranaan said, ""Keep praying and hope for the best.""

A group of Ukrainian orphans who arrived in Israel last year after the invasion of Ukraine were safely evacuated from their home in southern Israel less than 24 hours after Hamas began its attacks on October 7. 

The children all lived at the Federation of the Jewish Communities (FJC) of the CIS ""Alumim"" Children's Home and Orphanage in Zhytomyr, Ukraine.
It was evident in the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine that the children would have to leave Zhytomyr, said the group. Several organizations, including the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ), worked together to arrange for the safe transportation of the 60 children to safety in Israel. The IFCJ partners with FJC. 
In September 2022, the children moved to what they thought would be their permanent home in the city of Ashkelon, in southern Israel. 
That changed on October 7, the day of the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. 
""We woke up to the sound of a siren, then another and another,"" according to a press release from IFCJ.

Within minutes, said the release, those in the orphanage realized that ""this time something serious was happening, and that the Hamas had cooked us up an unconventional holiday."" 
The staff and children of the orphanage ran to a shelter, where they stayed for about six hours. 
""Then the stories of what was really happening around us started to arrive, about terrorists infiltrating and people wounded or killed,"" said the release. 
""At some point, we received an alert about the infiltration of terrorists close to us, and we were told to stay in our homes. Shocked and terrified, we locked ourselves into the house, staying close to the shelter, and prayed for this frightening situation to end quickly,"" they said.
""We decided that we had to leave the city, despite the fear of the trauma that a sudden departure could cause, despite the uncertainty about where would we go."" 

The group quickly found a place to live at a school in Kfar Chabad, a village in central Israel. 
But while they found a place that would take them in, the feat of actually getting there would be another challenge. 
""We then received an order from the IDF Home Front Command that there was great danger on the roads, and no one could leave the city or their home, and everyone must stay next to a safe room or shelter,"" said IFCJ. 
On the afternoon of October 8, however, the group was given permission to evacuate Ashkelon, Fox News Digital is told.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres says the ""reprehensible assault"" on Israel ""can never justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people."" 

Speaking at a summit Egypt is hosting on the Israel-Gaza war, Guterres called for Israel to spare civilians and hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure from its relentless airstrike campaign against Hamas. 
The secretary-general said a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is ""the only realistic foundation for a true peace and stability."" 
“Israelis must see their legitimate needs for security materialized, and Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for an independent state realized,” he said.
He said the U.N. is working around the clock with all parties to ensure a sustainable delivery of aid to Gaza, following the crossing of a first 20-truck convoy on Saturday.
“But the people of Gaza need a commitment for much, much more — a continuous delivery of aid to Gaza at the scale that is needed,” he said.

The Washington Post stealth edited
 the caption of a photo Thursday that initially described Israeli children as having been ""detained"" by Hamas terrorists. The caption was subsequently changed to say they were ""taken hostage.""
The terror group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, with hundreds of terrorists pouring into the country, killing over 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping many others. The Israeli military said Thursday there are still 203 hostages in Gaza.
The Post published a piece Thursday about the families of hostages, but it was the caption of a photo of a mother saying, ""Two of her children have been detained by Hamas,"" that drew the most attention. 
The Post was called out for the mild language in a series of viral social media posts.
Conservative author Bethany Mandel pointed out the initial caption in The Post story in a screenshot timestamped 7:45 p.m., writing, ""Interesting choice of words from Washington Post. ‘detained,’"" along with a thinking emoji.

At some point soon after, The Post stealth edited the sentence with no explanation. 
Mandel followed up with another screenshot timestamped at 9:18 p.m. showing the caption had been changed to ""have been taken hostage"" and commented, ""Well that was fast.""

A large barrage of rocket fire was detected headed towards south and central Israel on Saturday morning. 
Rocket alerts blared in Tel Aviv, Bat Yam, Ashdod and Yavne, according to data from Israeli Home Front Command.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths.


Hamas terrorists have fired thousands of rockets towards residential areas in Israel since the October 7 surprise attack, in which more than 1,400 Israeli civilians were slaughtered. 
Israel Defense Forces said Saturday more than 550 rockets launched by Hamas and the terror group Islamic Jihad have misfired and killed innocent civilians in Gaza. A fiery blast
 at the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday that caused international outcry is now believed to have been the result of a misfired rocket. 
Palestinian terrorists have continued to rain down rocket fire on Israel even as the Israeli military has returned fire with artillery and airstrikes targeting Hamas infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. 


Israel Defense Forces traded fire with Hezbollah terrorists on Israel's northern border with Lebanon on Saturday, after terrorists fired anti-tank missiles into Israeli territory overnight. An Israeli-American dual citizen serving as a reservist was killed in one of the attacks, IDF said. 
The soldier was identified as Staff Sgt. (res.) Omer Balva, 22, a commander in the 9203rd Battalion of the Alexandroni Brigade, the Times of Israel reported. A child of Israeli parents, Balva grew up in Rockville, Maryland. He was in the U.S. last week when called into reserve service, and he promptly returned to Israel to report for duty. 

The Israeli military said an anti-tank guided missile was fired from Lebanon into the Margaliot area in northern Israel. IDF responded with a drone strike against the terrorist squad. 
Additionally, another missile was launched from Lebanon targeting the Hanita area, IDF said. Israeli troops responded with artillery fire that struck missile launchers on the Lebanese side of the border, IDF said. 
“The IDF is ready for all scenarios in the various sectors and will continue to act for the security of Israeli citizens,” a military spokesperson said. 
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Saturday that Hezbollah terrorists
 have been paying a ""heavy price"" for their attacks on Israeli military outposts since the war with Hamas began on Oct. 7.


The first convoy of humanitarian aid for Palestinians
 arrived in southern Gaza on Saturday, crossing into the besieged territory over the border with Egypt.
President Biden said earlier this week an agreement with the Israelis had been reached to allow 20 aid trucks to cross the border at Rafah and added Friday that the first of those trucks would pass through within 48 hours.
Witnesses told Reuters aid trucks exited the crossing after checks and proceeded into Gaza's southern area including the major towns of Rafah and Khan Younis where hundreds of thousands of people displaced by Israel's unrelenting air war are sheltering.
However, Palestinian officials expressed displeasure that fuel supplies were not included in the delivery and said the relief was only three percent of what normally arrives for Gaza before the war broke out.

""Excluding the fuel from the humanitarian aid means the lives of patients and injured will remain at risk. Gaza hospitals are running out of the basic requirements to pursue medical interventions,"" the Gaza health ministry said.
Israel's ""total siege"" of Gaza after the Oct. 7 cross-border attack on southern Israel by Islamic terrorists with Hamas has left its 2.3 million people running out of food, water, medicines and fuel. 
The United Nations said the convoy included life-saving supplies that would be received and distributed by the Palestinian Red Crescent, with Hamas' consent. Israel has warned that no aid should end up in Hamas hands.
United Nations officials have said at least 100 trucks daily are needed to meet the urgent needs of the Palestinian people, a difficult task to accomplish in a warzone.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., is concerned President Joe Biden's supplemental request to Congress, which includes humanitarian aid for Gaza, will further fund terrorism in the region. 

""Even last week, we got a report that Hamas was intersecting aid that was going and whether it is money, food, fuel even first aid kits and medical supplies — they're taking it all and it is not even Gazans,"" Blackburn told Fox News Digital in an interview Friday. ""So, we've got to move to a position where humanitarian aid is going to make it to people that are suffering, and not terrorists.""
Last week, the United Nations agency that delivers aid to Palestinians, announced Hamas leaders in Gaza had stolen medical supplies and fuel that was meant for civilians. They later deleted the post on X and claimed nothing had been stolen.

In Biden's $105 billion emergency supplemental request, he outlined $9 billion for Ukraine, Gaza and Israel.
""The majority of the American people support Israel, and they want to make certain that aid is going to make it to people who need that aid,"" Blackburn said. ""You now have this progressive group that conducts themselves as if they are Hamas sympathizers, and that is incredibly disappointing to see.""
Blackburn's jab was aimed at progressive ""Squad"" members like Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ilhan Omar who have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and oppose more funding for Israel's military.

Leftist commentator Hasan Piker raised more than $1 million for Palestinian medical relief in a matter of days through a Twitch campaign.
""I'm incredibly proud of you guys,"" Piker told his fans as the donations poured in. ""It's incredible, it's unimaginable, it is ridiculous. This is where this community thrives."" 
More than 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers have died since Hamas launched a surprise attack on Oct. 7. Retaliatory strikes from Israel have killed more than 4,000 Palestinians and injured thousands more, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Piker launched the fundraiser about a week ago. Fans raised $180,000 in the first 40 minutes and surpassed $1 million as of Wednesday afternoon. Piker kicked in at least $50,000, according to the Tiltify page.

The funds will be split between ANERA, Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, Palestine Red Crescent Society and Medical Aid for Palestinians, according to Piker.
Piker did not respond to an interview request from Fox News about the fundraiser.
A self-described socialist, Piker is one of the most-watched streamers on Twitch. The live-streaming service is often used by gamers, but Piker has amassed millions of followers for his political commentary. He previously contributed to the left-leaning news and commentary outlet The Young Turks, which his uncle co-founded.
He has been a vocal critic of the ""colonial apartheid"" and accuses Israel of imposing on Palestinians. In a recent stream, he unleashed a profanity-laden tirade justifying Hamas' invasion.

At least 4,385 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel began its airstrike campaign to eradicate Hamas, including 1,756 children, the Hamas-led health ministry claims.

The Palestinian health authority said more than 14,000 people have been wounded since the start of the war on Oct. 7, when Hamas infiltrated Israel and massacred as many as 1,400 Israeli civilians, taking more than 200 captives back to Gaza. 
In the West Bank, Hamas claims Israeli forces have killed 84 Palestinians and wounded more than 1,400. 
The numbers reported by Hamas, which cannot be verified, make no distinction between civilians caught in the crossfire — including by Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets that misfire — and terrorists targeted by the Israeli military. 

Israel has said the bodies of some 1,500 Hamas terrorists were recovered inside its territory since the start of the war. Israel has continually bombarded the Gaza Strip with airstrikes on a mission to eradicate Hamas after the surprise attack two weeks ago.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has doubled down on his government's rejection of Palestinian refugees from Gaza.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have in Gaza have moved southward towards the border crossing into Egypt at Rafah as Israel has warned civilians to evacuate airstrikes at Hamas targets to the north. However, Egypt has not permitted Palestinians to flee the territory and resettle in the Sinai Peninsula. 
El-Sisi said the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people will not be resolved if Palestinians are forced to leave their homes and ""end the statehood dream."" 
“The whole Egyptian people won’t accept the liquidation of the Palestinian cause ... and will never happen on the expanse of Egypt,” el-Sisi said.

Speaking at a summit his government is hosting on the war Saturday, the Egyptian leader set out a roadmap to end the ongoing war which included ensuring the flow of aid to Gaza, negotiating a cease-fire, and embarking on peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians to establish a Palestinian state based on the borders before the 1967 Mideast war.
“We are facing an unprecedented crisis that requires full attention to avert expanding the conflict,” he said.

Save Our Allies co-founder Tim Kennedy is detailing the ""incredibly difficult"" challenges his rescue organization is facing trying to evacuate Americans trapped in Israel.
The former Army sniper joined ""FOX & Friends"" Friday from near the Gaza border in hard-hit Ashkelon to discuss the logistical hurdles as Israeli forces prepare a ground invasion to root out Hamas.

""We were in Egypt earlier this morning trying to figure out how they're going to be getting these people out… there's tons, tens of thousands of refugees that are going to be coming out of there. We have American hostages, American refugees. It's just an absolute mess,"" Kennedy began. 
""But one of the scariest things is the temperament around Israel by their neighbors. Being in Egypt, it was incredibly difficult, one, to move through the border and to obviously be an American moving into Egypt related to an Israel crisis. It's difficult here.""
A trio of House Republicans Thursday put forward a resolution
 ""[c]ondemning the Biden Administration for failing to fulfill the United States Government’s duty to American citizens left stranded in Israel"" as violence rips through the country.
Kennedy however applauded the State Department for doing ""amazing work"" by arriving quickly and providing ""constant"" flights. He described the first days in Israel as the most difficult following Hamas' attacks.

""There are people that were hiding in bunkers. There were people that were too scared to leave the positions that they were at after seeing the videos that were coming out. We had to physically go and find those people and then escort those people from where they were to where they could be flown out,"" he said, describing flights out on a ""one-propeller airplane from Haifa to Cyprus.""
""It's been hard. We were in Be'er Sheva yesterday talking to a police unit,"" he continued. ""They had to respond to this area. And all along the east side of Gaza, they lost one-quarter of everyone that is in their department, was injured, was missing, is missing still, or was killed in the fighting. You can see just the despair and brokenness inside of them and the things that they saw on the ground.""

The New York Times is defending its rehiring of a Gaza journalist who was previously exposed for praising Hitler.
The Times rehired freelance videographer Soliman Hijjy as part of its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. In August 2022, the pro-Israel media watchdog HonestReporting shed light on Hijjy, whose work had been featured by the Times between 2018 and 2021.
HonestReporting found that Hijjy praised Adolf Hitler in a 2012 Facebook post, writing, ""How great you are, Hitler"" in Arabic. 
In a 2018 post, Hijjy shared a photo of himself with a caption that translated to either ""I'm in tune like Hitler during the holocaust"" or ""in a state of harmony as Hitler was during the Holocaust.""
In a separate post, he referred to the terrorist group Hamas' rocket fire toward Israel as ""the resistance.""
At the time, a spokesperson for The Times told HonestReporting that it was looking into Hiijy's social media posts and declined to comment further in response to FOX News' inquiry. 

However, in the wake of Hamas' horrific Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, Hijjy's name has reemerged in the Times' coverage of the brewing war, as first pointed out by the Jewish newspaper Algemeiner. 
The Times is now standing by Hijjy. 
""We reviewed problematic social media posts by Mr. Hijjy when they first came to light in 2022 and took a variety of actions to ensure he understood our concerns and could adhere to our standards if he wished to do freelance work for us in the future,"" a spokesperson for the Times told FOX News Digital. ""Mr. Hijjy followed those steps and has maintained high journalistic standards. He has delivered important and impartial work at great personal risk in Gaza during this conflict.""

FOX News Digital asked multiple follow-up questions, including what were the Times' specific standards Hijjy was adhering to and how can he cover the Israel-Gaza conflict impartially when he has praised Hitler in the past. The Times spokesperson declined to comment further.

Israel's ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan, Nobel Prize laureate Professor Daniel Kahneman and family members of Israeli hostages hold petition for release of children held in Gaza. (Israel mission to U.N.)

Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan and the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza are calling for the United Nations to demand the immediate release of children held captive by Hamas.

A petition signed by 86 Nobel Prize winners demands the release of children held hostage by Hamas terrorists to Untied States Ambassador Robert Wood. The U.S. will deliver the petition to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, according to a news release. 
“Since the barbaric Hamas massacre of children, women and the elderly, the UN has betrayed its mission to prevent and fight against atrocities and war crimes. The UN has almost completely ignored the blood of Israeli citizens and even the kidnapping of children and babies. This is the last moment in which the UN can justify its existence,"" said Ambassador Erdan. 

""I call on the UN Secretary-General to wake up and prove that the blood and lives of the kidnapped children are really important to him, and that he does not prioritize aid to Gazan supporters of the massacre in Israel over innocent children kidnapped by terrorists. The Nobel Prize winners placed before the Secretary-General the proper scale of moral values — I urge him to listen to them!”


An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said Saturday the families of 210 kidnapped civilians have been informed that their relatives are held hostage by Hamas. 
The update comes as Israel enters the 15th day of its war since Hamas terrorists infiltrated the country on October 7 and savagely killed as many as 1,400 Israelis, taking some captives back to Gaza. Israel has responded with a relentless campaign of airstrikes on the Gaza Strip — where some 2 million Palestinians live — and has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the border with Gaza in anticipation of a ground operation to eradicate Hamas.

""We continue to attack governmental and military targets, eliminate terrorists that took part in the attack on Saturday October 7th, and terrorists who may be a threat in the next stages,"" the IDF spokesperson said. 
On Friday, two American nationals held captive by Hamas were released. A source with knowledge of the release confirmed to Fox News that the two American hostages, a mother and her daughter, were released ""on humanitarian grounds"" following Qatari mediation efforts.
IDF also said that more than 550 rockets launched by the terror groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have misfired and killed innocent civilians in Gaza. 
Israel has urged Palestinian civilians to move south, away from military targets in the northern Gaza Strip. ""We will increase the attacks over Hamas' strongholds in the northern Strip towards the next stages in the war,"" IDF said.
A limited supply of humanitarian aid is moving into the Gaza Strip from the southern border crossing with Egypt in Rafah after Israel agreed to let food, water and medicine be delivered to the Palestinian people.
Meanwhile, in the country's north, Israeli troops have continued to clash with Hezbollah terrorists
 on the border with Lebanon.
""Our message is clear,"" IDF said. ""Whoever tries to infiltrate the territory of Israel will get killed, and whoever shoots towards us will get hurt.""


On a tour of southern Israel
 Thursday aimed at boosting morale among troops preparing for a likely ground operation inside Gaza, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant promised to lead Israel to a decisive victory against Hamas.   
""We will be precise and forceful, and we will keep going until we fulfill our mission,"" Gallant stated.  
What exactly that mission is has been clearly echoed throughout Israel’s military ranks up to its political leadership over the last two weeks since an elite unit of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel.  
After the murder of 1,400 people, civilians and soldiers and the kidnapping of 210 people, Israel has said it will not stop this war until Hamas, its people and its infrastructure are wiped out. 
Voices around the world have begun questioning whether Israel’s response is ""proportionate,"" calling for restraint as the civilian death toll in Gaza rises and demanding a cease-fire before this conflict drags in other, more nefarious, regional players 
But Israelis remain steadfast, believing there is no choice — ""It’s either them or us."" There is no room in the region for both.  
Speaking to Fox News Digital, Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, reiterated Israel’s goal to destroy Hamas.
""Demanding a ceasefire from Israel is saying that Hamas should get away with what it did — and should keep its ability to do it again,"" Levy said. 

""Until we complete our mission of dismantling Hamas, urging a ceasefire is the pro-Hamas position. 
""We’re talking about whole families cremated alive, burned until there was nothing left of the children but fragments of bone and ash,"" Levy said, describing the sprawling attack on multiple communities and towns throughout southern Israel. ""These images reminded us not only of ISIS but of the worst horrors of the Holocaust. Israel cannot allow this satanic terror organization to threaten its citizens any longer.""

Former Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, a Libertarian, said Friday that several of his relatives were killed in a Greek Orthodox church in Gaza that was damaged by an Israeli airstrike amid the war between Israel forces and Hamas terrorists.

Amash is a Palestinian-American who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2021. The former congressman left the GOP in 2019 before later joining the Libertarian Party.
""With great sadness, I have now confirmed that several of my relatives (including Viola and Yara pictured here) were killed at Saint Porphyrius Orthodox Church in Gaza, where they had been sheltering, when part of the complex was destroyed as the result of an Israeli airstrike,"" Amash wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. ""Give rest, O Lord, to their souls, and may their memories be eternal.""
""The Palestinian Christian community has endured so much. Our family is hurting badly. May God watch over all Christians in Gaza—and all Israelis and Palestinians who are suffering, whatever their religion or creed,"" he continued.


The explosion struck St. Porphyrius Thursday evening and knocked down a wall of the church. At least 500 displaced Muslims and Christians had taken shelter in the church, where the Hamas-run government's health ministry said at least 16 were killed.
The Israeli military said a strike on a nearby command center damaged part of the church, and that the incident is under investigation. The military said the church was not the target of the strike.
More than 5,600 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel since Hamas launched its largest attack against Israel in decades on October 7, leading to retaliatory action from Israeli forces. Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.

The Rafah border crossing connecting Gaza to Egypt will open Saturday morning to allow passage for civilians fleeing Gaza amid continued violence between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists.
The U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs said the crossing is expected to open at 10 a.m. local time, although the time period it will remain open is unclear.
""We have received information that the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will open on Saturday, 21 October at 10:00 AM local time,"" the U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs said in a statement. ""If the border is opened, we do not know how long it will remain open for foreign citizens to depart Gaza.""
""We anticipate that many people would attempt to cross should the border open, and U.S. citizens attempting to enter Egypt should expect a potentially chaotic and disorderly environment on both sides of the crossing ... The situation remains dynamic and fluid and the security environment is unpredictable. You should assess your personal safety and security before choosing to move toward the border or trying to cross,"" the statement added.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for Hamas to release all hostages and said that 10 Americans are still unaccounted for.
""First, it's very simple. Hostages should be released immediately and unconditionally. That's been our position from day one. It remains our position,"" Blinken said. ""I would not take anything that Hamas says at face value.""
His comments come after two hostages were released from Hamas captivity on Friday.

""We welcome their release. We share in the relief that their families, friends and loved ones are feeling. But there are still ten additional Americans who remain unaccounted for in this conflict,"" Blinken said.
Blinken said some of the 10 American citizens unaccounted for are being held hostage by Hamas.

As tensions heighten in the Middle East, U.S. forces in the region are facing hostile threats and an array of attacks as the Biden administration increases its support for Israel. 
A U.S. naval warship
 shot down 15 drones and four cruise missiles Thursday during a nine-hour span near the Yemeni coast, a larger barrage than was previously thought.
The USS Carney, a guided missile destroyer, was heading south through the Suez Canal in Egypt on Wednesday and was in the northern Red Sea when incidents occurred on Thursday.
Since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, there have been a handful of attacks on U.S. positions in the Middle East. The Pentagon has moved warships and aircraft to the region to be ready to provide Israel with assistance.
In addition, 2,000 U.S. troops were put on heightened alert and are ready to be deployed if needed. The troops are likely Army and Air Force personnel and would be able to respond quickly, particularly to provide intelligence and surveillance, transportation and medical assistance.

The aggression against American military personnel coincides with protests and riots near U.S. embassies in the Middle East. Below is a rundown of attacks on U.S. forces in recent days. 
U.S. forces intercepted two one-way attack drones targeting Iraq's al-Asad air base just west of Baghdad where American troops are located. One drone was destroyed, and the other was damaged, U.S. Central Command said. 
Coalition forces sustained minor injuries and there was some damage to the base. 
In another part of Iraq, U.S. forces at the al-Harir air base destroyed a drone. No injuries were reported. 

""Our missiles, drones, and special forces are ready to direct qualitative strikes at the American enemy in its bases and disrupt its interests if it intervenes in this battle,"" Ahmad ""Abu Hussein"" al-Hamidawi, head of the Iraqi Kataib Hezbollah militia, said in a statement. 
Thursday, Oct. 19
The USS Carney was in the Northern Red Sea when it shot down the four cruise missiles and 15 drones launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. No injuries or damage were reported. 
The Defense Department initially said the warship shot down three land attack cruise missiles and ""several"" drones before the full scale of the attack was known. 
A defense official said the cruise missiles and drones were shot down with the SM-2 surface-to-air missiles and that the rockets were clearly headed for Israel. A U.S. official said they don't believe the missiles — which were shot down over the water — were aimed at the U.S. warship.
Syria
On the same day, the Al Tanf Garrison military base in southern Syria where American troops are present was targeted by two drones. U.S. and coalition forces engaged and destroyed one drone while the other impacted the base. 
U.S. troops have maintained a presence at the base for a number of years to train Syrian allies and monitor Islamic State militant activity.
Friday, Oct. 20
Two rockets were fired toward the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center in Iraq, near the Baghdad International Airport around 2:50 a.m. 

One rocket was intercepted by a counter-rocket system and the other impacted an empty storage facility. No casualties were reported.

The visit coincides with Biden's pledge to support Israel. The administration has already promised military support, sending U.S. carriers and aid to the region.
On Monday, Biden spoke with several world leaders and his own national security team about the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the besieged Gaza over fears the conflict could expand.
Biden spoke by phone with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about the fallout from Hamas terrorist fighters' surprise attacks on Israel that left 1,400 dead and retaliatory strikes that have killed at least 2,778 Palestinians. Biden scrapped a planned trip to Colorado on Monday where he was expected to tout his economic agenda.

"Biden’s suspended Iran special envoy once pushed engagement with Hamas, Hezbollah terror groups",2023-10-12,Fox News,['Benjamin Weinthal'],"GOP Reps. Max Miller and Brian Mast discuss the war in Israel and the latest about suspended Iran special envoy Robert Malley.
President Biden’s embattled former U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley has been catapulted into the spotlight again for his previous efforts to normalize relations with the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hamas, which has massacred more than 1,200 Israelis, including at least 27 Americans.
Biden said Monday that American citizens were likely taken hostage by Hamas. When Malley was suspended for reportedly mishandling classified information in June, his contacts with Hamas were scarcely addressed.
At the time, Malley confirmed that his clearance was being investigated but said he was confident about a positive outcome.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MIDDLE EAST'S HEZBOLLAH AND HAMAS GROUPS?
""I have been informed that my security clearance is under review. I have not been provided any further information, but I expect the investigation to be resolved favorably and soon. In the meantime, I am on leave,"" Malley told Fox News.
Speaking on ""Fox and Friends"" Tuesday, Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., said the ""State Department gives no information on Malley, why his departure, why his security clearance has been revoked. We do know that there has been staff that has been accused of working on Iranian information campaigns.""
Asked about the status of the investigation, a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement that ""Rob Malley remains on leave, and we have no further comment. The Department does not comment on individual security clearances.""

After working in the Clinton administration, and prior to his service with Biden, Malley spoke with officials from Hamas and also penned a 2006 Time magazine piece, ""The U.S.'s policy in the Middle East is flawed. Here's how to fix it,"" in which he wrote, ""Today the U.S. does not talk to Iran, Syria, Hamas, the elected Palestinian government or Hezbollah. … The result has been a policy with all the appeal of a moral principle and all the effectiveness of a tired harangue.""
The U.S. government has classified Iran’s regime as the world’s worst international state sponsor of terrorism and designated Hamas and the Lebanese-based Hezbollah movement as terrorist organizations. Iran’s regime aided Hamas, according to Israel’s government, in its slaughter of Israelis and Americans on Saturday.
In a 2009 documentary interview, Malley said it was ""a mistake to only think of them in terms of their terrorist violence dimension,"" referring to Hamas, Hezbollah and the Sadrist Movement in Iraq, noting that they ""are social and political movements, probably the most rooted movements in their respective societies.""
""There's so much misinformation about them. … I speak to them and my colleagues speak to them [Hamas], and now we may disagree with them, but they have their own rationality … none of them are crazies,"" Malley said in the film titled ""Cultures of Resistance."" Malley was the program director for the Middle East and North Africa division of the International Crisis Group.
He also said about Hamas that ""It has a charity organization, a social branch; it’s not something you can defeat militarily either, and people need to understand that.""

When Fox News Digital asked the State Department spokesperson if Malley had defended or promoted Hamas, they responded, ""The United States government designated Hamas as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997.""
Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., noted on X, formerly Twitter, that after the envoy's suspension, ""Malley’s contacts with Hamas & other extremist groups raised concerns in the past. Knowing his background & views, why did @Potus and & @SecBlinken select Malley for this sensitive position in the first place?""
The foreign espionage allegations against Malley and his Iran team have elevated concern about his contacts with Hamas due to its coordination with Iran to launch a scorched earth war against the Jewish state.

An Israeli woman who was taken hostage by Hamas recently told Israeli outlet Ynet that her fellow captives are still alive.

Kibbutz Nir Oz resident Nurit Cooper, 79, was released last week after being kidnapped on October 7. According to an English translation of the Ynet piece, she is ""slowly recovering"" from the traumatic experience. Cooper's husband is still in custody of Hamas.
""The abductees are alive,"" Cooper is quoted as saying. ""Everything must be done to bring them back. I want all the families to be as happy as my family is.""
Cooper's son told the outlet that her recovery is ""not easy at all.""
""She remembers details, but doesn't always share,"" he explained. ""She prefers to focus on the future. Father is still kidnapped and she worries about him very much. They were kidnapped together and held together in the same underground room, along with five other kibbutz members.""
""Father must have realized that mother and Yochaved were released,"" he added. ""The event is very traumatic for her, because the kidnapping was very violent.""

The Massachusetts family stranded in Gaza amid the ongoing war between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists said they continue to struggle to access drinking water, fuel and other resources and are hoping for safety as they await updates from the U.S. government about a possible exit plan.

Abood Okal, Wafa Abuzayda and their 1-year-old son, Yousef, were visiting family in Gaza when Hamas launched its largest attack against Israel on Oct. 7. The family has been in the region since late September, and had intended to return home to Medway, Massachusetts, on Oct. 13 before the violence delayed their plans.
In an audio recording obtained by Fox News Digital, Okal explained that the family ran out of drinking water on Sunday and that a nearby desalination station had run out of fuel needed to power generators. He said they have been roaming the main roads and streets in Rafah City, where they are staying in a single-family home with 40 other people including his sister Haneen and her three kids, in search of trucks or carriages carrying tanks of 1,000 or 2,000 liters of drinking water. Haneen and her children are also Americans.

""We stood in line, I think it was for maybe about two hours, to fill one gallon. They tried to limit the portions, so ours was a gallon. And we're hoping that would last us for the rest of the day today and for most of tomorrow until we could find another place to get drinking water from,"" Okal said in the recording created on Monday.
""Near the eastern side of the city where we're staying, every once in a while we would hear heavy caliber gunfire that we believe is fired from tanks,"" he continued. ""And our biggest fear now is that the ground invasion is imminent near the neighborhoods where we are because we've heard of the reports of both intense artillery shelling, as well as gunfire exchanges, as an invasion is happening or right preceding an invasion. And that's basically what's been happening in northern Gaza.""

Okal added, ""We're staying hopeful that tonight will be another safe night for us. At this point, we don't care much about how intense the bombing is as long as we come out alive in the morning.""

Foreign passport holders were seen entering the Rafah Crossing from Gaza to Egypt Wednesday morning.
These individuals are the first travelers to enter the crossing since the war between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists began on Oct. 7.
This, after Qatar mediated an agreement between Egypt, Hamas and Israel in coordination with the U.S. to open the Rafah Crossing on Wednesday. The agreement allows foreign passport holders and some critically injured civilians out of Gaza.
It is unclear how long the crossing will remain open.

More than 9,700 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel since Hamas launched its largest attack against Israel in decades on Oct. 7, leading to retaliatory action from Israeli forces. Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.

The Israeli military reported additional casualties inside the Gaza Strip, the day after it said its first two soldiers were killed during its ground invasion against Hamas Tuesday morning, the first such casualties in Gaza since Israel began its ground operations there.
According to Fox News’ Trey Yingst, who is in Israel, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) were hit by an anti-tank guided missile while operating in the northern part of the strip, leaving 10 dead.

Israeli forces entered the second stage of their war with Hamas in what is expected to be a lengthy military operation. Until this week, Israel had largely relied on airstrikes and artillery to retaliate against Hamas' massacre in Israel on Oct. 7.
Military officials have warned that the war will be long and difficult, potentially spanning months or longer.
The IDF began expanded ground operations this week and ground troops are now tasked with clearing out a complex network of Hamas tunnels and other fortified strongholds. IDF says it has attacked 11,000 targets in Gaza Strip since Oct. 7.
""Combined forces of the IDF attacked many terrorist targets throughout the Gaza Strip during the night, including operational headquarters and squads of Hamas terrorists,"" a translated statement from the IDF Wednesday read.
Fox News' Lawrence Richard and Trey Yingst contributed to this report.


At campuses across the U.S., anti-Israel protesters have organized massive demonstrations since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. The surge in incidents has been paired with antisemitic rhetoric and violence against Jews, leaving many students feeling unsafe and fearful of attending class.
""So we've had a plethora of incidents happen at UC Berkeley, everything from two physical assaults of students getting physically hurt on campus. We've had professors offering bonus and extra credit to students for attending pro-Hamas rallies. But the most concerning is Jewish student leaders getting an email from administration telling us to avoid certain parts of campus, to avoid showing our faces, to avoid filming these incidents and at these events, due to a fear of our safety,"" UC Berkeley student Danielle Sobkin said on ""FOX & Friends First"" Tuesday.
""So what does it mean when administrators are telling me to not be a target, which is leading me to believe that in order to be safe on campus at UC Berkeley, I need to hide my Jewish identity.""

Campuses including UC Berkeley have become an increasingly hostile environment and home to some of the most aggressive anti-Israel demonstrations.
Most recently, student groups supporting Palestinians held a national walkout on Wednesday in support of Gaza and to protest U.S. funding of Israel, according to posts by pro-Palestinian student groups on social media.

Nearly three dozen U.S. citizens were killed when Hamas terrorists executed a sneak attack on Israel on Oct. 7, according to the U.S. State Department.
A spokesperson for the State Department confirmed to Fox News Digital
 that 35 Americans were killed in the attacks.
""At this time, we can confirm the deaths of 35 U.S. citizens who were killed in the October 7 attacks,"" the spokesperson said, adding that an additional U.S. citizen died as a result of continued violence after the attacks.
As far as the number of Americans who have died in Gaza, the State Department spokesperson said they are not aware of any, but information about U.S. fatalities in Gaza is ""extremely limited"" because of the situation.
""We extend our deepest condolences to the victims and to the families of all those affected,"" the spokesperson said on behalf of the department.
Of the 35 U.S. citizens the State Department said have died, 26 have been confirmed.
Fox News' Lawrence Richard and Greg Wehner contributed to this report.


The Ivy League student who allegedly made threats of a mass shooting and antisemitic violence at Cornell University has been criminally charged.
Court documents show that 21-year-old Patrick Dai, a junior at Cornell has been federally charged in connection with the threats following an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

""It is concerning, of course, that the threats came from within the campus. It must be particularly frightening for students to think that someone they sat in class with or socialized with could make such threats,"" said William A. Jacobson, a Clinical Professor of Law and Director of the Securities Law Clinic at Cornell Law School. ""I hope that there will be a full and transparent investigation of his connections, if any, to any groups or others who may have known of the threats.""

An Emerati official said on Tuesday that the Abraham Accords will be adhered to, despite the escalating conflict between the Israeli military and Hamas terrorists.

Ali Rashid al-Nuaimi, who serves as Chairman of the Defense, Interior and Foreign Affairs Committee of the United Arab Emirates Federal National Council, made the remarks during an online briefing, according to the European Free Press.
“This is the third war in Gaza. Whenever there is something happening in Gaza, people come to us and ask: ‘What do you think of the Abraham Accords. Are you going to change?’” Nuaimi said.
""The Accords are our future,"" he explained. ""It is not an agreement between two governments but a platform that we believe should transform the region where everyone will enjoy security, stability and prosperity.""
""They are part of our history and they should be part of our future,"" the official added.

A Pentagon official announced that U.S. troops in the Middle East have been attacked at least 27 times since the Israel-Hamas war began.
Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed the new number at a briefing on Tuesday afternoon. An official told Fox News that the two latest attacks were at Mission Support Site Green Village in Syria. They took place on October 23 and 27.
It was reported on Monday that forces had been attacked 24 times. A 25th incident took place on Tuesday morning, in which drones were launched against Iraq’s Ain al-Asad airbase.
Militants, likely backed by Iran, have been attacking American forces with one-way drones and rockets. One American contractor has died, and at least 24 troops have been injured.

16 of the incidents took place in Iraq, while 11 happened in Syria. Officials say that most of the weapons ""failed to reach their targets, thanks to our robust defenses.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken will fly to Israel later this week, as the country's war against Hamas terrorists continues.
Spokesperson Matt Miller confirmed the news to Fox News on Tuesday.
“Secretary Blinken will travel to Israel on Friday for meetings with members of the Israeli government, and then will make other stops in the region,"" he said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Blinken told lawmakers that the U.S. ""anticipate[s]"" that some humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip will inevitably go to Hamas terrorists.
""Can I promise you in this committee that there'll be 100% delivery to the designated recipients? No, there will inevitably be some spillage,"" Blinken explained. ""We haven't seen it to date, but I think we have to anticipate that. But the overwhelming, overwhelming majority of the assistance thus far is getting to people who need it. And we need more.""

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Doron Spielman joined ""The Story"" on Tuesday afternoon after Hamas commander Ibrahim Biari was killed in a Gaza refugee camp.
Spielman told host Martha MacCallum that Biari was ""one of the major architects and executioners of that horrific massacre that took place on October 7th.""

""My heart goes out to the civilians [who were killed]. But we have to ask the question, why was this Hamas battalion commander literally operating underneath a civilian area?"" Spielman asked. ""It goes to show exactly what we're trying to face. They have no concern for the civilians and we're trying to defend our own civilians and eliminate them while trying to minimize when possible damage to their own civilians.""
""Unfortunately, the death of any civilian is a reality of war. And we mourn that,"" he added.
Spielman also disputed claims that there was no fuel in Gaza, which has been under a blockade by the IDF. Hamas has launched 8,000 rockets against Israel's civilian population since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks.
""This whole time that they're saying there's no fuel in Gaza and there's no aid in Gaza,"" the spokesperson said. ""There's never been a lack of fuel, apparently, for the rockets that they've been sending our direction.""


The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have killed a Hamas leader who was hiding in a refugee camp in Gaza, according to Israeli officials.
Trey Yingst reported the news live from southern Israel on Tuesday night.

""We are learning more about the strike that took place earlier today on the Jabalia refugee camp,"" Yingst explained. ""The Israelis say that fighter jets targeted the commander of Hamas's central Jabalia battalion. His name [was] Ibrahim Biari, and he was responsible, according to the Israelis, for a number of attacks.""
The reporter discussed the news as the Israeli military continued launching airstrikes in the Gaza Strip.
""You can see this area and an explosion there in the distance as I'm giving you this information here...There is some sort of firefight taking place in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, just beneath where those flares are being fired,"" he added. ""We've heard heavy machine gun fire and targeted airstrikes. The Israelis appear to be calling in some air support.""
The Israelis have repeatedly warned Palestinians to evacuate the camp in recent days, due to the presence of Hamas operatives there.

A high-ranking United Nations official has retired after calling for a one-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. In his letter, the official wrote on what he called ""essential points"" regarding the war between Israel and Hamas terrorists.

In what was described as his ""last official communication"" as the director of the New York Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Craig Mokhiber sent an Oct. 28 letter to Volker Türk of Austria, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, detailing what he believes a ""U.N.-norm-based position"" on the war would look like.
In what critics are calling comments devoid of historic fact, Mokhiber called for a one-state solution, which could mean the end of the Jewish state.

The Senate moved to confirm President Biden's nominee pick for ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, Tuesday after weeks of Republican opposition.
In a 53 to 43 vote, senators confirmed Lew, who faced mounting Republican opposition to his nomination over his past work on Iran sanctions while he worked as treasurer under the Obama administration in the weeks leading up to the vote.

Every Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — except Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., — voted against Lew's advancement in the committee earlier this month.

Former Israeli diplomat Shahar Azani appeared on ""Outnumbered"" on Tuesday afternoon to give his reaction to the United Nations Security Council's highly-criticized response to Hamas terrorists.
The security council is accused of remaining silent towards atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists in its latest war against Israel, which began on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah on October 7.

""When I look at those images from the United Nations, the very organization that came to be to stand up against that evil and now looks the other way, it's clear to me that that moral compass that it was supposed to be has completely lost its sense of direction,"" Azani began.
""Why do I feel a special affinity to be on this program with you, Kayleigh?"" the former diplomat said to ""Outnumbered"" co-host Kayleigh McEnany. ""Because when I look at the resolution at the UN, 120 states voted not for a cease fire, but to disregard Hamas as evils. We know that the forces of good are outnumbered out there, and it was only the United States and other 13 countries were the one that stood up for moral clarity and against moral hate.""
""And even though we are outnumbered, because we have the upper moral hand, I have no doubt that we will win this,"" he added.

During a White House press briefing on Wednesday, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby accused Hamas terrorists of 'putting up obstacles' to prevent Americans from leaving Gaza.

""Why have Americans and foreign nationals still been unable to get out of Gaza, even though aid trucks have been going in?"" a reporter asked during the briefing. ""Beyond putting blame on Hamas, what more can you say about what's going on here and what the progress is?""
""How about if I just put the blame on Hamas?"" the White House official shot back. ""I mean, Secretary Blinken talked about this in his hearing this morning.""
""I mean, they are they are putting obstacles up to allow us to get folks out,"" he continued. ""It's not Israel. It's not Egypt. It's not places like Jordan...Hamas has been making it difficult to do this.""

White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby denied claims that Israel has genocidal intentions in its war against Hamas during a briefing on Tuesday.
Kirby was answering a question by a journalist who referenced recent remarks by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu recently alluded a biblical story between the Amalekites and Israelites, which some have viewed as genocidal.
""I'm not qualified to speak much on biblical history here, but obviously, I think we've been crystal clear not only there but around the world on our concerns about genocidal behavior by any leader,"" Kirby began. ""And that is not what we're seeing, is real desire to do that.""

""They are going after Hamas terrorists, going after leadership that attacked their country October 7th in a gross and in barbaric fashion,"" he added. ""They are not interested in genocidal activity to the people of Gaza.""
Kirby acknowledged civilian losses in Gaza, but maintains that it was not the Israeli military's intention to kill innocents.
""We recognize there have been many thousands of casualties...way too many, should be zero. We understand that,"" he concluded. ""But their war aim, as I said earlier, is not to target the innocent civilians of Gaza. Their war aim is to go after Hamas.""

Israel said a senior Hamas commander was killed Tuesday in an airstrike that damaged a refugee camp in northern Gaza. 
The IDF said fighter jets, acting on Israeli intelligence, killed Ibrahim Biari, the Commander of Hamas' Central Jabaliya Battalion, a terrorist involved in plotting the Oct. 7 attacks that killed as many as 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers. 

""Biari oversaw all military operations in the northern Gaza Strip since the IDF entered,"" IDF said in a statement. ""He was also responsible for sending the terrorists who carried out the 2004 terrorist attack in the Ashdod Port in which 13 Israelis were murdered, and was responsible for directing rocket fire at Israel, and advancing numerous attacks against the IDF, over the last two decades.""
The strike hit a densely populated area of the Jabalia refugee camp, where Israel said terrorists built underground infrastructure to plan and execute terror attacks, using civilians as human shields. 
The IDF said a ""large number of terrorists"" were killed in the ""wide-scale strike,"" which collapsed ""underground terror infrastructure"" allegedly belonging to Hamas.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Tuesday that a person of interest in relation to threats of a mass shooting and antisemitic violence at Cornell University had been identified by law enforcement. 
""This individual is currently in New York State Police custody for questioning,"" Hochul wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""When I met with Cornell students yesterday, I promised them we would do everything possible to find the perpetrator. Public safety is my top priority and I'm committed to combating hate and bias wherever it rears its ugly head,"" the governor added. 
Earlier Tuesday, Hochul had delivered a message of ""solidarity"" to New Yorkers a day after she visited Jewish students at Cornell University's Center for Jewish Living who have received online death threats amid the Israel-Hamas war, insisting there is ""zero tolerance"" for antisemitism, Islamophobia or ""hate or any kind."" 
In a video, the Democrat announced that she tapped Judge Jonathan Lippman, the former chief judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, to conduct an independent third party review of CUNY [City University of New York] policies and procedures related to antisemitism and discrimination. 

""We will take on the antisemitism we have seen on college campuses. The problem didn't begin with the weeks following October 7th attacks. It's been growing on a number of campuses,"" she said. ""While his assessment will be focused on CUNY, his recommendations will be a roadmap for institutions across the state and the country. My commitment to your safety is unwavering, but we can't do it alone.""

Yale Daily News (YDN), the independent student newspaper and oldest college daily in the country, issued an editor's note on a pro-Israel column over claims it made ""unsubstantiated claims that Hamas raped women.""
An Oct. 12 column by Yale student Sahar Tarak titled, ""Is Yalies4Palestine a hage group?"" was hit with an editor's note on Oct. 25, reading, ""This column has been edited to remove unsubstantiated claims that Hamas raped women and beheaded men."" 
Yalies4Palestine is a student group that describes itself as ""organizing Yale's campus community to support the human rights and freedom of the Palestinian people"" on its Instagram page.

The piece by Tartak still contains lines about beheadings by Hamas and condemning the ""barbarism"" that was carried out by ""terrorists from Gaza who seemed intent on killing as many Jews as possible.""
""Yes, they kidnapped children,"" she wrote. ""Yes, they cheered the whole time. It’s all on video. Over 1,200 are dead, not to mention those kidnapped and maimed. This is terror, and Hamas is a designated terrorist group — as described by the United States, European Union and dozens of other countries.""
There have been multiple reports that Hamas terrorists committed rape during their rampage. Israel released footage of one captured attacker who said they were given permission to rape the corpse of a girl, according to The Times of Israel. NBC News reported on ""signs of rape"" in videos of the attack presented to journalists last week. Military forensic teams in Israel also said they found signs of torture and rape among the victims, according to Reuters.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken has admitted to lawmakers Tuesday that ""we have to anticipate"" some of the humanitarian aid flowing into the Gaza Strip will end up in the hands of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. 

Blinken made the remark in front of the Senate Appropriations Committee as he said the U.S. is trying to coordinate 100 trucks of aid per day into the conflict zone this week, arguing that it is the ""bare minimum of what is needed."" 
""Can I promise you in this committee that there'll be 100% delivery to the designated recipients? No, there will inevitably be some spillage,"" he said. ""We haven't seen it to date, but I think we have to anticipate that. But the overwhelming, overwhelming majority of the assistance thus far is getting to people who need it. And we need more."" 
Blinken said so far, the U.S. has gotten up to 50 trucks of aid per day into the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. 

""Before the conflict in Gaza, before Hamas' aggression against Israel and its response, the U.N. and other agencies and other organizations providing relief were sending in between 500 and 800 hundred trucks a day,"" he said. ""Right now, we're up to almost 60. We're trying to get to 100 this week."" 
Fox News Digital's Greg Norman contributed to this update.


House Speaker Mike Johnson told ""Outnumbered"" co-host Kayleigh McEnany in a recent interview that he was intending to divert some IRS funding for aid to Israel. 

""My intention and my desire in the first draft of this bill is to take some of the money that has been set aside for building and bulking up the IRS right now,"" he said, and repurpose it for aid to Israel. 
""They have about $67 billion in that fund and we'll try to take the $14.5 [billion] necessary for this immediate and urgent need,"" Johnson said of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas that started on Oct. 7 after terrorists killed, kidnapped and assaulted Israeli, American and other citizens at a festival.  
When asked how ""united"" the Republican Conference was on the providing funding to Israel in its war efforts, Johnson said the GOP was ""100 percent united."" 
""I hope the Democrats will be as well,"" Johnson added. 
House Republicans have rolled out a bill giving $14.3 billion in aid to Israel, while cutting into cash President Joe Biden allocated toward the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) last year.

The 13-page bill released on Monday would completely offset the foreign aid by rescinding those funds from the Inflation Reduction Act passed last year. Specifically, it targets some of the $80 billion the package gave to the IRS.
The new Speaker is expected to hold a vote on the Israel aid bill on Thursday.

Chinese companies have removed the name of ""Israel"" from their online maps, Fox News has confirmed. 
Maps from the companies like Baidu and Alibaba list all the countries around Israel, but no longer name of Israel.

The Wall Street Journal first reported that internet users in China were confused by the missing Jewish state. 
""Baidu’s Chinese language online maps demarcate the internationally recognized borders of Israel, as well as the Palestinian territories, plus key cities, but don’t clearly identify the country by name,"" the outlet reported. ""The same is true with online maps produced by Alibaba’s Amap, where even small nations like Luxembourg are clearly marked. Neither company responded to questions on Monday. It is unclear whether the development is new, though it has been discussed by Chinese internet users since war broke out.""
China has a close relationship with Iran, and Iran is a known backer of Hamas. China remains Iran largest trading partner. Over the past several months, the Chinese have bought a record amount of Iranian oil.

Nearly 2,500 Holocaust survivors and their families wrote a letter to President Biden
 thanking him for his support of Israel after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. 
""We are Holocaust survivors, children of Holocaust survivors, grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, and great grandchildren of Holocaust survivors living in the United States, and we write to thank you for strongly supporting Israel in its time of need,"" the letter dated Monday states. 
""Holocaust survivors lived through the worst of human capability,"" the letter continues. ""We witnessed the murder of our families, our communities, and the near annihilation of the Jewish people. We chose the United States as our home, rebuilt our lives, and worked tirelessly to share our most painful experiences so the Holocaust would never occur again. We fought for the rights of all people to live in peace.""

""Yet, the Jewish people have been massacred again. We are mourning and grieving the loss from the attacks of October 7, 2023, in which Hamas terrorists killed more than 1,400 people and abducted more than 200 innocent civilians in Israel. The trauma runs deep. The terrorists went home to home, family to family, killing and torturing with no regard for human life, just as the Nazis did. 

""But today is different,"" it concludes. ""Today we have Israel. Today we have the United States of America and a President willing to support the State of Israel and denounce antisemitism at home and abroad.Your unwavering affirmation of Israel’s right to defend itself is meaningful to us. President Biden, we thank you, and we need your continued support to ensure that Israel recovers from this tragedy and emerges stronger than before. The United States and Israel have a shared destiny, united in our love for humanity and our belief in a brighter future. Thank you for standing with us and with the people of Israel."" 
The letter was signed by 870 holocaust survivors. 


The Israel Defense Forces said that two soldiers were killed and two others were seriously wounded during fighting with Hamas terrorists inside the Gaza Strip on Tuesday.

The slain soldiers were identified as Staff Sgt. Roei Wolf, 20, of Ramat Gan, and Staff Sgt. Lavi Lipshitz, 20, from Modiin, who both served in the Givati Infantry Brigade's reconnaissance unit, Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reported. 
The names of the soldiers were released after their families were notified, IDF said. 
These were the first Israeli casualties reported since the second phase of the war started with expanded ground incursions into Gaza on Saturday.
IDF said earlier Israeli troops were engaged in fierce combat with Hamas terrorists in what is now the 25th day of the Israel-Hamas war. The military said they were engaged in a firefight with Hamas overnight and into Tuesday. Tanks and bulldozers have joined soldiers on the ground inside the Gaza Strip.

A Florida Republican congresswoman
 is introducing a bipartisan bill to strip the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) of taxpayer funding until the international body condemns the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas.
Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., on Monday introduced the Stand With Israel Act to withhold U.S. funding to the UNHRC until a resolution is passed condemning Hamas after the group's deadly surprise terrorist attack on Israel on October 7.
""It should not be a heavy lift for the UN, which claims to promote global human rights, to pass a resolution condemning what will go down in history as one of the deadliest attacks against the Jewish people,"" Luna said in a press release exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital.

""The United States should not fund the UN Human Rights Council until it stops targeting our closest ally,"" Luna said. ""The UN must unequivocally condemn Hamas’s utter disregard for human life and the terror they are inflicting on Israelis and the innocent Palestinians they use as human shields.""
Luna said that until ""this institution can defend objective human rights, not subjective ideological bias, it is a scourge to the values it claims to champion.""
""The hypocrisy in all of this is while the UNHRC lectures Israel on defense, China (one of their HRC members) is actively putting Muslims in concentration camps,"" Luna said. ""It’s time they save the world their virtue-signaling and we defund them.""
The Stand With Israel Act prohibits taxpayer funds from going toward the UNHRC until both the U.N. Security Council and U.N. General Assembly adopt a clear resolution condemning the Palestinian terrorist organization.

The World Bank is warning Monday that the prices of oil and other commodities could see ""large increases"" if the Israel-Hamas war spreads through the Middle East. 

The Washington-based institution said in its October 2023 Commodity Markets Outlook report that despite commodity markets responding ""calmly"" to the war, ""historical precedent"" suggests that escalating conflict in the region could substantially disrupt commodity supply. 
""Although neither Israel nor Gaza is a major energy producer, an escalation of the conflict and its spread to the wider region could lead to large increases in the prices of oil and other commodities,"" the report says. ""Historical precedent also indicates this could have destabilizing implications for the global economy. Moreover, spillovers to food prices could exacerbate food insecurity in conflict-afflicted areas in the region and around the world."" 

If that happens, depending on the level of impact to the global oil supply, the World Bank says prices per barrel could rise from the 2023 Q4 baseline forecast of $90 a barrel to around $102 in a ""small disruption scenario"" to as much as $157 a barrel in a ""large disruption scenario."" 
""These types of disruptions in oil supplies can have a cascading impact on the prices of other commodities – especially natural gas prices, which are even more susceptible to transportation disruptions than oil,"" the World Bank also says.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday warned Iran-backed terrorist groups including Hezbollah against taking advantage of the Israel-Hamas war to start a larger conflict in the Middle East.
“It is also important that this war does not escalate into a major regional conflict,” Stoltenberg said in Oslo, where he attended the annual meeting of the Nordic Council.
“The suffering we have seen in recent weeks reminds us once again that we must not give up the work for a lasting, peaceful political solution to the conflict.”

The eight-member regional grouping includes Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, as well as the autonomous areas of the Aland islands, the Faeroe Islands and Greenland.
U.S. forces conducted airstrikes on facilities in eastern Syria last week in response to continued attacks on U.S. troops by Iranian proxies in recent weeks, striking a weapons depot and an ammo storage area believed to be used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News' chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin.

The strikes come as Pentagon officials have warned of the possible fallout of Israeli's war with Hamas leading to increased danger for U.S. forces, with one senior defense official telling reporters that they ""see a prospect for much more significant escalation against U.S. forces and personnel in the near term and, let's be clear about it, the road leads back to Iran,"" according to a report from Military.com.
The warning came as Israel began its second phase, which saw a number of troops enter Gaza in response to the Hamas terror group's attack on communities in the country's south on Oct. 7 that saw some 1,400 Israelis killed and hundreds taken hostage. While U.S. troops are not directly involved in the conflict, forces carrying out counter-terrorism operations in Iraq and Syria have been put at increased risk, particularly from attacks by Iranian-backed proxies looking to influence U.S. support for Israel.

FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday, where he said the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israel may inspire attacks against America. 
""The reality is that the terrorism threat has been elevated throughout 2023, but the ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United States to a whole another level since the horrific terrorist attacks committed by Hamas against innocent people in Israel a few weeks ago,"" Wray told lawmakers.  

""We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration, the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago. In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West. Al Qaida issued its most specific call to attack the United States in the last five years. ISIS urged its followers to target Jewish communities in the United States and Europe. Hezbollah has publicly expressed its support for Hamas and threatened to attack US interests in the Middle East. And we've seen an increase in attacks on U.S. military bases overseas carried out by militia groups backed by Iran.""

A Senate hearing on a supplemental funding package to assist Israel in its war against Hamas descended into chaos Tuesday morning as more than a dozen hecklers have been detained after yelling at Secretary of State Antony Blinken for a “ceasefire now!”

The unrest boiled over immediately after Blinken began speaking at the Senate Appropriations Committee meeting, with the first heckler screaming at Blinken to “stop supporting the genocide and ethnic cleansing of the people of Gaza.”
“Ceasefire now! Save the children of Gaza, save the children of Gaza!” the man shouted as his voice was cracking.
“Where is your pride America?” he asked the hearing room while being dragged out by security.
Blinken struggled to complete his opening statement as several more hecklers ground the proceedings to a halt with outbursts. At one point, a group of people stood up and raised their hands, which were painted red, and chanted, ""from Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go!""

Kamala Harris and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak are reportedly to meet and discuss the wars in Ukraine and Israel during the vice president's trip to London this week to attend an artificial intelligence summit. 

Harris is expected to talk about the Israel-Hamas war and ""consult on next steps in our support for Ukraine"" with Sunak during a visit to London later this week, Reuters reported Monday, citing an unnamed White House official. 
The meeting comes days after a ""60 Minutes"" interview with Harris aired, in which the vice president addressed whether American forces might get involved on the ground in the Gaza Strip, where American hostages were taken during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.
""We have absolutely no intention, nor do we have any plans to send combat troops into Israel or Gaza, period,"" Harris said.
The vice president is scheduled to depart for the United Kingdom Tuesday and return on Nov. 2, and she will be accompanied by her husband, Douglas Emhoff, according to her office.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for missile and drone attacks fired at Israel on Tuesday.

In a video statement, the militants said it was the third such attack and threatened to carry out more strikes ""until the Israeli aggression stops,"" the Associated Press reported.
Earlier this month, a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by the Houthis, who control much of northern Yemen, including its capital, Sanaa. Mysterious projectiles have also struck inside Egypt, near the Israeli border.
Iran has long denied arming the Houthis even as it has been transferring rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, missiles and other weaponry to the Yemeni militia using sea routes. Independent experts, Western nations and United Nations experts have traced components seized aboard other detained vessels back to Iran.
Critics have urged the United States to consider reclassifying the Houthis as a terrorist organization as the Iran-backed group has mounted attacks against Israel and U.S. military assets. 

""In word and in deed, the Houthi’s in Yemen are proving to the world their connectivity to Iran’s axis of resistance and why they should have remained on the U.S. terror list,"" Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital. 
""Pulling punches and failing to hold Iran and it’s proxies to account, even diplomatically, shows you how far things have devolved,"" he added.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pushed back on activists demanding a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, saying such an agreement would be a ""gift"" for the terrorist government.
The former presidential candidate made the remarks during the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy's 30th anniversary event on Thursday. 
""People who are calling for a ceasefire now, don’t understand Hamas,"" Clinton said, according to The Jerusalem Post. ""That is not possible.""

She continued, ""It would be such a gift to Hamas because they would spend whatever time there was a ceasefire in effect rebuilding their armaments, creating stronger positions to be able to fend off an eventual assault by the Israelis.""
Israel has entered its fourth week of war against Hamas after the terrorist group infiltrated the country on Oct. 7, firing thousands of rockets at residential areas and butchering civilians.
As many as 9,900 people have been killed in the war on both sides, including at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 32 Americans. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claims more than 8,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and 111 in the West Bank. At least 10 Americans are feared to be among the 239 people held captive by Hamas.

Rocket sirens are sounding in Tel Aviv and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday as IDF forces intensify ground operations inside the Gaza Strip.
Hezbollah terrorists also fired missiles at two IDF posts on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, IDF said. The army reported a separate strike against a terror cell in southern Lebanon it said was planning to shoot anti-tank guided missiles at northern Israel. 
The military said earlier IDF troops are engaged in ""fierce battles against Hamas terrorists deep in the Gaza Strip."" 


IDF forces attacked a Hamas outpost in the northern Gaza Strip and killed dozens of terrorists, also seizing weapons, the military said.
The Israeli attacks targeted anti-tank missile launching squads, missile launching positions, observation posts and seized explosives and weapons, according to IDF.
IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari posted photos and video of the Israeli ground operations, showing soldiers moving through Gaza ruins and tanks firing. 


A Columbia University professor condemned an open letter penned and signed by Columbia and Barnard College professors in support of students who have made anti-Israel statements in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack.
Jennifer La'O, who teaches macroeconomics, took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to condemn the letter. 

""As a @Columbia faculty member, I absolutely do NOT endorse this open letter,"" she posted. ""This letter is a disgrace. I am disheartened and disappointed in my colleagues who have signed this.""
Universities across the country, most notably Ivy Leagues colleges, have been ground zero for pro-Palestinian support in the U.S. following the surprise Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel that left at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers, including 33 Americans, dead. In addition, 239 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza. 
The faculty members published the letter Monday under the title: ""An Open Letter from Columbia University and Barnard College Faculty in Defense of Robust Debate About the History and Meaning of the War in Israel/Gaza.""

""The most recent devastating violence in Israel and Gaza that began on October 7, 2023 has had very disturbing reverberations on our campus – for all of us, students, faculty, staff, and the larger Columbia community,"" the letter began. ""We write now to express grave concerns about how some of our students are being viciously targeted with doxing, public shaming, surveillance by members of our community, including other students, and reprisals from employers.""
The letter calls on every person in the Columbia University community to do more to protect all students in response to ""those who label our students anti-Semitic if they express empathy for the lives and dignity of Palestinians, and/or if they signed on to a student-written statement that situated the military action begun on October 7th within the larger context of the occupation of Palestine by Israel.""

The Canadian government has reportedly attempted to clarify its stance on a ""humanitarian truce"" in the Israel-Hamas war, just days after the country abstained from a United Nations resolution on the matter. 

Delivering a speech Monday before the Economic Club of Canada in Toronto, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly called for ""humanitarian pauses"" and a ""humanitarian truce"" in Gaza, as at least seven Canadian nationals have died, at least two others remain unaccounted for and ""could be held hostage,"" and ""400 Canadians are trapped in Gaza."" 
""At this point, we need an agreement from all parties to get our foreign nationals out,"" Joly said Monday, telling a business audience she had been in contact with Israel, Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. nearly every day for the past three weeks. ""All hostages must be released, and it is important to allow food, fuel and water in Gaza. And Canada will be reaching out to more countries to join in that call."" 
Joly spoke out against the Hamas terrorist attacks, while also recognizing the situation that Palestinian civilians find themselves in.

""We have seen horrific scenes of unspeakable violence as Hamas launched its terrorist attacks against the people of Israel, which Canada unequivocally condemns,"" Joly said. ""What is unfolding in Gaza is also a human tragedy. The humanitarian situation facing the Palestinian people – Palestinian women and children in particular – is dire. 
""And extremist settler attacks continue in the West Bank and must stop,"" Joly added. ""Like all states, of course Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist attacks. It has an obligation to do so in accordance with international law. For even in crisis, there are principles and even in war, there are rules.""

A Massachusetts family has been stuck in Gaza for weeks amid the ongoing war between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists, and they are now without adequate resources – including food, water, fuel and connectivity – as they continue to look for a way home.

Abood Okal, Wafa Abuzayda and their 1-year-old son, Yousef, were visiting family in Gaza when Hamas launched its surprise attack against Israel on Oct. 7. The family, which had been in the region since late September, was initially planning to return to their home in Medway, Massachusetts, on Oct. 13.
Sammy Nabulsi, friend and attorney for the family, spoke with Fox News Digital about their situation on the ground in Gaza, which he described as ""extremely dangerous and dire,"" adding that their circumstances continue to worsen each day they remain in the region.
""Currently, the family is staying in a single-family home with 40 other people taking shelter,"" Nabulsi said. ""They're having to sleep on the floor, as they've been doing for a little over two weeks. Their chief concern has been access to water. A couple of times over the last week, they've run out of clean drinking water. They've had to resort to drinking salt water from a well that they have access to.""

""Another concern now on top of that is there hasn't been any access to fuel,"" he continued. ""They rely on diesel fuel to pull and pump the well water, which is just the running water that they have at this home, and also to filter it, which they've been unable to do because they've run out of fuel and have no access to any fuel. So there have been days when they've just had to drink salt water, unfiltered salt water, to stay hydrated.""

The University of California-Davis still has not completed its investigation into a faculty member allegedly tied to a social media account that violently threatened ""Zionist journalists"" and their children earlier this month.
A university spokesman told Fox News Digital on Monday it would provide updates once there was news to announce.

An account affiliated with a University of California-Davis faculty member named Jemma Decristo posted on Oct. 10 on X, ""One group of ppl we have easy access to in the US is all these Zionist journalists who spread propaganda & misinformation… they have houses w addresses, kids in school… they can fear their bosses, but they should fear us more."" The post ended with emojis depicting a knife, axe and drops of blood. 
The account has since gone private, and Decristo's biography on the UC-Davis page is inactive. Decristo has been an assistant professor in American studies and African American studies at the school, according to the Forward. 
Chancellor Gary S. May released a statement on Oct. 19 saying he disagreed wholeheartedly with the remarks and explained how the university was proceeding.

""I absolutely condemn the posts attributed to a UC Davis faculty member that recently appeared on the social media platform X,"" he wrote. ""I find the comments revolting in every way, and I disagree wholeheartedly with them. UC Davis rejects all forms of violence and discrimination, as they are antithetical to the values of our university. We strive to foster a climate of equity and justice built on mutual understanding and respect for all members of the community.""
He went on to say that when the university receives a complaint that a faculty member has engaged in misconduct, the matter is reviewed internally as a confidential personnel issue.

""Some have asked why this faculty member continues to be employed at UC Davis,"" May added at the time. ""The University of California system has specific procedures for the review of complaints of faculty misconduct consistent with university-wide policies and bylaws. The status of complaints lodged against faculty members are confidential personnel matters, so we are unable to publicly comment on the steps we are taking.""

Mosab Hassan Yousef, whose father is a founding Hamas leader, joined ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday and called on the United States to urge Egypt to open its borders to Palestinian refugees.
""We need to somehow put pressure on the Egyptian government so they can open the border for the Gazans to just depart,"" Yousef said. 

""Instead of the United Nations blaming everybody and saying 'humanitarian crisis,' they should allow civilians to evacuate. Egypt has to open the borders. The United States must put pressure, apply tremendous pressure on the Egyptian government to open the freaking border."" 
Limited humanitarian aid has passed through the border crossing at Rafah into Gaza, but Egypt has so far refused to take in Palestinian refugees. 
Egypt has long feared that Israel wants to force a permanent expulsion of Palestinians into its territory, as happened during the war surrounding Israel’s independence. Egypt ruled Gaza between 1948 and 1967, when Israel captured the territory, along with the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The vast majority of Gaza’s population are the descendants of Palestinian refugees uprooted from what is now Israel.

Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah El-Sissi, has said a mass influx of refugees from Gaza would eliminate the Palestinian nationalist cause. It would also risk bringing militants into Sinai, where they might launch attacks on Israel, he said. That would endanger the countries’ 1979 peace treaty. He proposed that Israel instead house Palestinians in its Negev Desert, which neighbors the Gaza Strip, until it ends its military operations.

American troops operating in the Middle East have been faced with an uptick in attacks in recent weeks, a trend that could continue as the U.S. supports Israel's war effort against Hamas.

""Calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen,"" Netanyahu said.

""Ladies and gentlemen, the Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war. This is a time for war. A war for our common future,"" he continued.

The head of a United Nations agency said during an emergency meeting Monday that ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions.""

Philippe Lazzarini, the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), warned against additional fighting in Gaza, where Israeli forces are launching a ground invasion to eliminate Hamas, which governs the territory.
Lazzarini warned Israel against the ""collective punishment"" of Palestinians and said a further breakdown of civil order following the looting of the agency’s warehouses by Palestinians searching for food and other aid ""will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the largest U.N. agency in Gaza to continue operating.""

Lazzarini, flanked by the head of the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF and a senior U.N. humanitarian official, provided briefings to the Security Council, where the officials painted a dire picture of the humanitarian situation in Gaza after more than a million people have been displaced. The meeting comes 23 days after Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attacks in Israel that killed over 1,400 people.
According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, which is run by Hamas, more than 8,300 civilians have been killed and tens of thousands have been injured since Israel launched retaliatory military action aimed at ""obliterating"" Hamas.
UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said the death toll includes more than 3,400 children, adding that over 6,300 have been injured.
""This means that more than 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza each day — a number which should shake each of us to our core,"" she said.


U.S. forces in western Iraq were targeted in another drone attack early Tuesday morning, according to a report, marking the latest in a string of assaults on American troops in the Middle East as the Israel-Hamas war continues.

Two armed drones were used against Iraq’s Ain al-Asad airbase, Reuters reported, citing a security source and a government source. The base hosts international troops that assist Iraq in defeating a terror group called the Daesh, or the Islamic State. No casualties or damage were reported.
Tuesday's attack would be the 25th on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. The attacks have included a mix of one-way drones and rockets, resulting in the death of an American contractor and 24 injured troops, according to U.S. defense officials.
The attacks have increased in recent weeks as President Biden and other senior leaders continue to express support for Israel and its right to defend itself after one of the worst terror attacks in decades left more than 1,400 people dead, including 34 Americans.

According to Reuters, a group called the ""Islamic resistance in Iraq"" endorsed the attack, which took place less than 24 hours after another missile attack from the same base in Iraq.
On Monday, five rockets landed a mile away from the al-Asad Air Base.
No injuries to American soldiers or the base were reported. Coalition forces also were not injured.

The Israeli Defense Forces
 and Israeli Securities Authority said troops killed Nasim Abu Ajina, the Hamas commander who they say directed the part of the Oct. 7 massacre in the Kibbutz Erez and Moshav Netiv HaAsara.
""Yesterday, based on IDF and ISA intelligence, IDF fighter jets struck the Commander of the Beit Lahia Battalion of Hamas' Northern Brigade, Nasim Abu Ajina, who directed the massacre on October 7th in the Kibbutz Erez and Moshav Netiv HaAsara,"" the IDF and ISA said in a joint statement. ""In the past, Abu Ajina commanded Hamas' Aerial Array, and took part in the development of the UAVs and paragliders of the terrorist organization.""
""His elimination significantly harms the efforts of the Hamas terrorist organization to disrupt the IDF's ground activities,"" the statement added.



More than 9,400 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel since Hamas launched its largest attack against Israel in decades on Oct. 7, leading to retaliatory action from Israeli forces. Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.

""We've had to sort through our anguish, our outrage, our fears and our differences on the issues,"" he said. ""I had a conversation with a group of you around this issue, and you were passionate and pushed me around some of the public statements I'd made.""
""And the issue is not a wish for different outcomes – an end to the killing, peaceful coexistence between two sovereign and free peoples – but rather different assessments of the path that we need to take in order to get there,"" the former president continued.

DeSantis refuses to back off demand that US refuse refugees from Gaza,2023-10-15,Fox News,['Michael Lee'],"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, in a Fox News interview at the New Hampshire Statehouse, says if some of his rivals for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination ‘don’t have a path, I think they should try to coalesce.’
Florida Gov. and GOP presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis Sunday stuck to his stance that the U.S. should not accept refugees from Gaza amid the ongoing conflict with Israel.
""Palestinian Arabs should go to Arab countries, the U.S. should not be absorbing any of those,"" DeSantis said during an appearance on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" Sunday.
The Florida governor's remarks come after he sparked controversy with comments made on the campaign trail in Iowa Saturday, arguing to those in the audience that the refugees would be ""antisemitic.""

""I don’t know what Biden’s going to do, but we cannot accept people from Gaza into this country as refugees,"" DeSantis said during the event. ""If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they are all antisemitic. None of them believe in Israel’s right to exist.""
The comments came on the heels of Israel warning civilians in the Gaza Strip to evacuate ahead of a planned ground invasion of the region by the country's defense forces in response to surprise attacks launched by Hamas on Israel last week.
The DeSantis comments elicited pushback from former Arkansas Gov. and fellow GOP hopeful Asa Hutchinson, who told reporters in New Hampshire that ""it’s a danger any time that you categorize a group of people as being simply antisemitic,"" according to a report from NBC News.
But Desantis later fired back at critics, arguing they had their ""head in the sand"" when it came to the realities in Gaza.

CASUALTIES, KIDNAPPED AND MORE NUMBERS SINCE HAMAS' ATTACK ON ISRAEL
""I will challenge anyone to say that in some of these countries that virulent antisemitism is not the norm,"" DeSantis said, according to the NBC News report, adding that ""if you’re not willing to acknowledge that, then you’ve got your head in the sand.""
DeSantis continued to defend his remarks during his Sunday interview, telling ""Face the Nation"" Hamas has helped form a ""toxic culture"" in the Gaza Strip.

""They elected Hamas, let's just be clear about that. Not everyone's a member of Hamas, most probably aren't, but they did elect Hamas in 2006,"" DeSantis said. ""This has been an issue for a long time. They teach kids to hate Jews, the textbooks do not have Israel even on the map. They prepare very young kids to commit terrorist attacks. So I think it's a toxic culture and I think if we were to import large numbers of those to the United States… it would increase antisemitism in this country and I think it would increase anti-Americanism.""

Foreign officials raise alarm over lack of humanitarian aid in Gaza as Israel prepares for ground operation,2023-10-14,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"Marine veteran Chad Robichaux weighs in as Israel prepares for an imminent full-scale ground invasion of Gaza.
Several countries have started to raise concerns about the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza as Israel prepares for a ground invasion of the territory following a terrorist attack last week. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesperson Stephan Dujarric on Saturday told Fox News Digital that ""discussions are ongoing at various levels involving all parties concerned"" about humanitarian access to Gaza. On the topic of potential human rights abuses on both sides, Dujarric said, ""We are always concerned about potential human rights abuses."" 
He added that the Secretary-General has been in ""intense"" phone contact with U.S., Israeli, Egyptian and European officials, among others, to move forward as ""quickly as possible on the critical issue of humanitarian access in Gaza.""
At least 3,200 people have been killed since Hamas launched thousands of missiles into Israel last week, including at least 1,300 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 27 Americans. Palestinian health authorities say at least 2,215 Palestinians have been killed, and more than 8,700 wounded.

""This is a time for the international community to come together around protecting civilians and finding a lasting solution to this unending cycle of death and destruction,"" he said. ""Even wars have rules."" 
""International humanitarian law and human rights law must be respected and upheld, civilians must be protected, and also, never used as shields,"" he added, calling for all hostages in Gaza to be released immediately.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday and stressed the need for international agencies to have clear access to Gaza and support for their duties, including humanitarian corridors for medical and relief aid.

""His Majesty warned of any attempt to forcibly displace the Palestinians from all the Palestinian Territories or to cause their internal displacement, calling for preventing a spillover of the crisis into neighboring countries and the exacerbation of the refugee issue,"" the Royal Hashemite Court wrote on social media platform X. 
Both Blinken and the king underscored the need for de-escalation in the region and an end to the hostilities while also addressing the humanitarian needs for civilians in Gaza, the U.S. State Department wrote of the meeting.

Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip, stopping the entry of food, water, medicine and fuel to the roughly 2.3 million residents while it continued to bombard the territory and demanding Hamas release the roughly 150 hostages its soldiers took during last Saturday’s unprecedented attack. 
Hamas on Saturday claimed that 13 of the reported 150 hostages they took had died during Israel’s bombing of the territory, but no agency has yet been able to verify those claims.

On Friday, Israel issued a warning for residents in northern Gaza to evacuate the area within 24 hours as a ""humanitarian step"" that aims to ""minimize civilian casualties"" during its planned ground offensive into the territory. 
The United Nation’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that the cumulative figure of displaced individuals has exceeded 338,000, ""of whom over two-thirds are taking shelter in schools run by the UNRWA,"" referring to the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Relief in the Near East. 
IDF SAYS IT CONTINUED TO ATTACK HAMAS MILITARY TARGETS, HEADQUARTERS IN GAZA STRIP; HAMAS OFFICIAL KILLED
The U.S. urged Israel to delay the start of the operation to allow the 1.1 million people living in the north to relocate. President Biden and Blinken have both repeatedly stressed the need for Israel to adhere to the ""rules of war."" 
The U.S. has reiterated that Hamas is responsible for the current atrocities and do not reflect the Palestinian people, who must be protected.

The Rafah crossing to Egypt had been the sole point of exit for the Palestinian people in Gaza, but Israel’s bombardment has made it impossible to continue operating the pass, Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said Friday. 
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi called for access through Rafah in a speech Thursday, but he also warned against letting in large numbers of Palestinians.

""The threat there is significant because it means the liquidation of this (Palestinian) cause,"" el-Sissi said at a military college graduation ceremony in Cairo. ""It’s important for its people to stay steadfast and exist on its land.""
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry later called the evacuation order a ""grave violation"" of international law.

Egyptian officials have long feared that Israel seeks to make their country responsible for Palestinians in Gaza, which Egypt ruled between the 1948 and 1967 Mideast wars. Egypt has joined Israel in its blockade of the Gaza Strip since the Hamas takeover, tightly controlling entry of supplies and the exit of people.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday said that Israel's blockade and bombing of Gaza in response to Palestinian militant group Hamas' attack was a disproportionate response amounting to a ""massacre,"" even as he offered to mediate a deal between Israel and Hamas. Israel's envoy to Ankara on Sunday said it was too early to discuss mediation.

A senior State Department official traveling with Blinken from Jordan to Qatar told The Associated Press that the U.S. is talking to Israel, U.N. agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross on creating safe zones within Gaza, where civilians can receive humanitarian aid. It was not clear whether the aid would enter from Israel or Egypt.

New York City mayor says ‘we are not all right’ after Hamas massacred Israelis,2023-10-14,Fox News,['Chris Pandolfo'],"New York City Mayor Eric Adams called out both celebrities and professional athletes for hateful rhetoric against Jews in the wake of Hamas' attack on Israel.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams delivered heartfelt remarks showing strong support for the city's Jewish community and Israel after the deadly terror attacks on October 7, the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. 
Speaking at a ""New York Stands with Israel"" rally on Tuesday, Adams said, ""We are not all right"" after the world witnessed the atrocities committed by Hamas in southern Israel, where terrorists committed murder, rape, torture and kidnappings and boastfully posted their crimes on social media. 
""We are not all right when we see young girls pulled from their home and dragged through the streets,"" Adams said to a crowd of thousands who had gathered to express solidarity with Israel. 
""We are not all right when we see grandmothers being pulled away from their homes, and children shot in front of their families. We are not all right when right here in the City of New York you have those who celebrate at the same time when the devastation is taking place in our city,"" he continued. 
ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR: LIVE UPDATES

""We are not all right when Hamas believes that they are fighting on behalf of something and their destructive, despicable action that carried out. We are not all right when we still have hostages who have not come home to their family. We are not all right, and we're not going to say we have a stiff upper lip and act like everything is fine. Everything is not fine. Israel has a right to defend itself, and that's the right that we know."" 
Adams remarks came after Israel declared war on Hamas in a conflict that has now claimed more than 3,200 Israeli and Palestinian lives, including at least 27 Americans. Adams, President Biden and other world leaders have acknowledged Israel's right to self-defense, but the civilian casualties from Israel's retaliatory strikes — made worse because Hamas terrorists hide behind human shields — have stoked anti-Israel sentiment and antisemitism at home and abroad.

Hamas called for Friday to be a ""Day of Rage"" and capped off a week of protests nationwide against Israel's response to the Gaza attacks. 
One New York City rally last week promoted by the local Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) chapter included pro-Hamas demonstrators ridiculing Israel supporters with images of a swastika.

According to a report released by Tel Aviv University's Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry and the Anti-Defamation League earlier this year, antisemitism continued to rise throughout the U.S. and the world in 2022. The report came after the 2021 version set new highs for antisemitic incidents, with he authors noting that ""2022 did not mark a reversal of the trend, and in some countries, most alarmingly the United States, it intensified.""
During his speech, Adams acknowledged that New York City has the largest Jewish population outside of Israel and condemned those who have voiced support for Jew hatred spread by Hamas. 
""We will not be all right until every person responsible for this act is held accountable. And we don't have to pretend,"" Adams said, thanking the city's religious leaders who ""denounce the hatred and the antisemitism that was displayed on one of the holiest days of the year.""

""This was intentional. This was bitter. This was nasty. This was something that shows Hamas must be disbanded and destroyed immediately,"" he continued. 
""Your fight is my fight. That swastika not only displays the pain of antisemitism, it displays the pain of racism among African Americans. You marched with us with Dr. King. You stood with us with all the fights we have. And I'm saying we're going to stand with you and stand united together. And we don't have to be all right. We should be angry at what we saw.""

Israel warns civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate from area within 24 hours: ‘For your safety’,2023-10-13,Fox News,['Elizabeth Pritchett'],"'FOX News @ Night' panelists James Carafano and Dov Waxman discuss an expected Israeli ground invasion of Gaza and reports the IDF has given Palestinians 24 hours to evacuate. 
Israel has warned the 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza to evacuate the area within 24 hours as a ""humanitarian step in order to minimize civilian casualties"" ahead of the military's response to Hamas' terrorist attacks.
Israel Defense Forces spokesman Jonathan Conricus shared the message he said was sent to citizens in Gaza on X, formerly Twitter, Friday morning.
""The IDF calls for the evacuation of all civilians from Gaza City from their homes southwards for their own safety and protection and to move to the area south of the Wadi Gaza, the river Gaza, as shown on the map,"" Conricus said.
He explained that telling people to move south of the river makes the directions clear and understandable for everybody, regardless of if they have a map or not.

Conricus said the evacuation order is for safety purposes, adding that civilians will not be able to return to Gaza City until another announcement clearing the area is made. He also said to not approach the area of the security fence with Israel.
Images later emerged of Palestinians within the Gaza Strip heading south. In one photo, two men could be seen riding on the hood of a car to flee the area.

The United Nations told The Associated Press it received a notice from Israel issuing the 24-hour evacuation warning, and Conricus confirmed communications with the UN.
A diplomatic source told Fox News' Trey Yingst that Hamas is preventing Palestinians from evacuating areas targeted for Israeli airstrikes. During a live report Friday morning, Yingst said a senior official with the terrorist group told him evacuation is ""technically impossible.""

""Civilians of Gaza City, evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields,"" the IDF said in a news release.
The IDF said it will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City and will make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians.
""There are civilians here who are not our enemy and we do not want to target them. We are asking them to evacuate so we will be able to continue to strike military targets belonging to Hamas in the Gaza Strip,"" Conricus said.

As of Thursday night, more than 2,800 Israelis and Palestinians have been killed and at least 9,800 have been wounded since Hamas launched its attack on Israel on Saturday. The death toll is expected to rise as Israeli forces reportedly prepare for a ground invasion of Gaza.

"Arkansas man sues US government in effort to save wife, children trapped in Gaza",2023-11-02,Fox News,['Danielle Wallace'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest from southern Israel. 
An Arkansas man of Palestinian descent is suing the U.S. government in an effort to have his wife and their two young children, both American citizens, evacuated from Gaza amid Israel’s war against Hamas. 
The lawsuit filed on behalf of American citizen Ramiz Younis of Little Rock in the Eastern District of Arkansas on Monday says that his wife, Folla Saqer, a U.S. legal resident, their two-year-old son, Zain Ramiz Younis, and their eight-month-old daughter, Zaina Ramiz Younis, attempted to flee Gaza through the Egyptian boarder at the Rafah border crossing as recently as Sunday, ""only to be turned away by the Egyptian authorities."" 
""In fact, Falla had her passport stamped literally at the border just as the bombing from the Israel Government began,"" the complaint says. ""Because Israel threatened to bomb the area, despite her passport being stamped and being with her children, she was denied exit from Gaza. She abandoned multiple items such as luggage and a baby stroller at the border."" 
The lawsuit implores defendants Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to ""use all resources at their disposal that are necessary and available, including but not limited to deployment of military ships, vessel and airplanes and/or contracting with private commercial ship liners and airline carriers to evacuate U.S. citizens from Gaza and return them safely to the United States or another nation outside of the warzone in the most expeditious manner available.""

As of Thursday, Fox News obtained a list of exactly 400 Americans cleared to leave Gaza ""as soon as today."" Younis' son and daughter, both U.S. citizens, are on the list, but the status of his wife was not immediately known. 
The DoD declined to comment on the ongoing litigation Thursday. Younis' attorney, Justin Eisele, confirmed to Fox News Digital that the children have been cleared to leave Gaza, ""but not their permanent resident mother."" 
""As you can imagine, a two-year-old and 8-month-old cannot cross the border alone,"" he wrote by email. 
In a post on X, Eisele added Thursday, ""Ramiz wife was REFUSED exit at the border with her children."" 
""My client's wife and two children made it to the border in Rafah today, only to be denied. They were told the kids could cross, but she could not. Which made the crossing impossible. How are two tiny children supposed to cross the border? Crawl?"" the attorney said.

In an email to Fox News Digital, a State Department spokesperson also declined to comment on the federal lawsuit but said, ""The Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.""""It has been a top priority for us to get Rafah open not just for trucks coming in, but for U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals coming out,"" the statement continued. ""An initial group of foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, departed Gaza through Rafah on November 1, and these departures continue.""""We expect exits to continue over the next several days,"" the spokesperson added. ""We will not stop working to get U.S. citizens and their family members out as safely as possible.As State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday, ""for operational security reasons we will not be giving rolling updates on the number of U.S. citizens and family members who have crossed as this process unfolds over the next several days,"" the emailed statement said. ""This remains a complex situation with serious implications for the safety and security of U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens in Gaza in need of assistance should complete the crisis intake form on travel.state.gov."" 
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also told reporters Wednesday, ""We do expect to be able to get all our Americans out"" of Gaza but admitted ""it’ll take some time."" 
""They are trapped abroad in the Gaza Strip in an active war zone under imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury,"" the filing says of Younis' family. ""On information and belief, they are not alone among U.S. Citizens also in grave danger. However, they have lost any effective communication with the outside world."" 
ISRAELI SOLDIER RESCUED IN GAZA AFTER BEING CAPTURED BY HAMAS IS NOW PROVIDING INTEL FOR ‘FUTURE OPERATIONS’
The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the U.S. government’s efforts to evacuate Palestinian-Americans from the active war zone in Gaza, alleging that the United States is carrying out ""disparate treatment"" by ""currently evacuating"" Americans ""of different ethnic and religious backgrounds from the same region"" and, therefore, has ""impermissibly infringed upon the exercise of their fundamental rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""

Tlaib faces calls to be barred from Israel briefings after ‘misinformation’ about Gaza hospital explosion,2023-10-19,Fox News,"['Brandon Gillespie', 'Houston Keene']","Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., a member of the far-left ""Squad,"" repeated during a Wednesday protest the debunked claim that Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) were responsible for the bomb that struck a Gaza hospital, reportedly killing hundreds.
EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is facing a demand for her removal from future classified briefings on military operations in Israel after she sided with Hamas over the Biden administration concerning the explosion at a Gaza hospital earlier this week.
In a Thursday letter obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital, Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, accused the far-left ""Squad"" member of spreading ""misinformation"" when she repeated Hamas' claim Israel was behind the hospital explosion. U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials have repeatedly said it was caused by a rocket fired from Gaza.
Jackson also accused her of being a Hamas sympathizer.

""I demand that Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib be prevented from participating in any classified briefing about Israel's ongoing military operations, Israel's self-defense efforts, or any American military movements in and around the region,"" Jackson wrote to Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.
""We must not allow Hamas sympathizers in this body to serve as the mouthpiece for Palestinian terrorists. Rather than condemn the attacks by Hamas, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has chosen to side with Hamas by spreading misinformation,"" he wrote.
Jackson went on to write it had ""become clear that Congresswoman Tlaib's allegiance lies with Hamas,"" and that she couldn't be trusted with sensitive information that could ""put American and Israeli lives at risk.""

In a statement to Fox, Jackson vowed to do everything in his power as a member of the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees. He said Tlaib and her fellow ""Squad"" members should not view American intelligence on the situation in Israel.
""I don't know what's more concerning, that we have Members of Congress who are antisemites and support Hamas, or that we let those Members of Congress attend classified briefings on the war in Israel,"" he said.

Biden admin sent tens of millions in COVID relief funds to group accused of harboring Hamas terrorists,2023-10-14,Fox News,['Andrew Mark Miller'],"Daniel Levi, who survived the Supernova Fest massacre, tells ‘America Reports’ that she ran and hid in an orange tree for six hours.
The Biden administration sent $33.7 million from the American Rescue Plan, a spending bill meant to combat COVID, to a Palestinian relief organization that has previously been accused of providing safe harbor to terrorists in Gaza and has been referred to as ""effectively a branch of Hamas.""
The American Rescue Plan, a COVID-19 relief bill pushed through Congress with unanimous Democrat support in the Senate and almost unanimous in the House, allocated $33.7 million to the United Nations Relief & Works Agency through the State Department’s Migration and Refugee Assistance program, according to data from USASpending.gov, as part of $500 million that was included in the bill for the State Department to fund migration and refugee assistance.
UNRWA has faced intense scrutiny in recent years from critics who say the group has not done enough to prevent aid from reaching the hands of Hamas terrorists. UNRWA locations have reportedly housed Hamas activities and spread Hamas propaganda in schools. 
In 2014, the left-leaning New Republic described UNRWA as ""effectively a branch of Hamas.""
JUDGE LETS LAWSUIT CLAIMING BIDEN ADMIN KNEW US FUNDS WERE AIDING PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS MOVE FORWARD

UN Watch reported earlier this year that UNRWA schools were complicit in teaching children to hate Jewish people and glorify terrorism. UN Watch reported that USRWA has acknowledged that teachers ""mistakenly"" produced and distributed inciting material but promised in 2021 that it no longer circulates such material.
UNRWA acknowledged in 2014, and condemned, Hamas missiles that were found at one of its schools in Gaza twice in one week. 
""UNRWA strongly and unequivocally condemns the group or groups responsible for this flagrant violation of the inviolability of its premises under international law,"" the group said at the time.
""Facilities of UNRWA, the UN Palestinian refugee agency, have been repeatedly used by Hamas Palestinian terrorists for military purposes, as staging grounds, weapons depots, and hideouts,"" professor Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, told Fox News Digital. 
""They have also been used as shields, giving cover to nearby military assets. UNRWA officials have had all kinds of inappropriate relationships with Hamas itself. Whenever these facts — war crimes — are revealed, the UN does a quick ‘investigation,’ sometimes accompanied by a meaningless expression of regret, and carries on,"" added Bayefsky, who is also president of Human Rights Voices.
""The fallout from their past behavior is that it is impossible and unwise to take them at their word, or to assume they are a neutral party, instead of serving as an enabler of Palestinian terrorism, today.""

Former President Donald Trump cut off UNRWA’s funding in 2018 in a move that was criticized by the Brookings Institution, which alleged that he was cutting off ""life saving"" aid to impoverished Gaza residents.
That funding was reinstated by the Biden administration despite acknowledging concerns that there was a possibility Hamas could benefit from foreign aid.
A March 2021 internal State Department document that was obtained by the Washington Free Beacon earlier this year and verified by Fox News Digital shows officials privately communicating their concerns that a Biden administration plan to unfreeze over $360 million in U.S. funds for the Palestinian Authority could risk benefiting terror groups, a trade-off the officials argued was necessary for national security.
""We assess there is a high risk Hamas could potentially derive indirect, unintentional benefit from U.S. assistance to Gaza. There is less but still some risk U.S. assistance would benefit other designated groups,"" the State Department wrote in the document. ""Notwithstanding this risk, State believes it is in our national security interest to provide assistance in the West Bank and Gaza to support the foreign policy objectives.""

""Notwithstanding this risk, State believes it is in our national security interest to provide assistance in the West Bank and Gaza to support the foreign policy objectives.""
In July 2022, the Biden administration announced it had given more money to UNRWA than any other entity in the world.
""This contribution cements the United States’ status as UNRWA’s largest donor,"" the White House said in a press release announcing $201 million of taxpayer dollars going to the organization. ""These new funds bring the total United States assistance to UNRWA during the Biden Administration to more than $618 million.""
The New York Post reported this week that the Biden administration has given a total of $730 million to UNRWA.

""They don't really have much else to keep going in Gaza except for contributions through things like the United Nations, which are important to remember, funded by the U.S. taxpayer,"" Victoria Coates, former Trump deputy national security adviser, told Fox News Digital this week. ""Now, we cut that off during the Trump administration, but that money has been flowing again for the last two years."" 
Jonathan Schanzer, Senior Vice President for Research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital the decision to fund UNRWA has ""indirectly benefited Hamas.""
""We can say for certain it indirectly benefits the Hamas government in Gaza,"" Schanzer said. ""UNRWA provides services that the government should be providing… this has alleviated some of the Hamas government's burden in the Gaza Strip.""
Supporters of UNRWA, and even some critics, argue that the agency does do a lot of good in the region and that often it is necessary for Israel to work with UNRWA to get aid and assistance to Palestinians.
On Thursday, the United Nations posted on social media that 220,000 people were being sheltered in 92 UNRWA schools.

""UNRWA human development and humanitarian services encompass primary and vocational education, primary health care, relief and social services, infrastructure and camp improvement, microfinance and emergency response, including in situations of armed conflict,"" UNRWA's website states.
The UNRWA was founded by charter following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War ""to carry out direct relief and works programmes for Palestine refugees"" and is funded ""almost entirely by voluntary contributions from UN Member States.""
Fox News Digital reached out to the White House and UNRWA and did not receive a response.
A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that UNRWA ""remains a lifeline for millions through services such as food assistance for food-insecure Palestinian civilians and has a mandate from the UN General Assembly to provide education, health, and emergency and social services, among other services.""

""As we do with other UN agencies, we are committed to serving as a strong partner to the Agency to help it provide the most effective and efficient assistance possible while fully respecting principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence, and in a manner that respects human rights. Violations of the humanitarian principle of neutrality are never acceptable.""
A State Department spokesperson also told Fox News Digital that Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) funds sent to UNRWA are given to Palestinian refugees for health services, protective equipment for health care workers, hospitalization services, and assistance to mitigate the economic impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable families.  
""Oversight of U.S. funding to UNRWA includes monitoring visits by Department staff to UNRWA facilities, direct programmatic and financial reporting to the United States, close scrutiny of third-party reporting, review of audit findings, and membership and participation UNRWA’s Advisory Commission,"" the spokesperson said.

JD Vance circulates memo calling for Israel and Ukraine aid to be split up,2023-10-23,Fox News,['Jamie Joseph'],"FOX News senior congressional correspondent reports the House of Representatives is in a state of ‘unprecedented chaos.’
While Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is supportive of President Biden's $105 billion request to Congress to fund Israel and Ukraine, among other emergency items, some GOP lawmakers are not on board with coupling the two.
Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, joins the latest push from legislators who are skeptical of aid to Ukraine but fully support Israel's war against Islamic militant group Hamas. 
Vance began circulating a memo among senators on Monday, titled, ""Differentiating Ukraine and Israel."" 
A wrench could be thrown into getting the package across the finish line as more GOP senators voice opposition to the mega package. Additionally, the House still stands in disarray as the lower chamber has yet to elect a new speaker. 
BIDEN ADMIN URGES MAJOR FUNDING INCREASES FOR AID TO UKRAINE, ISRAEL, AND GAZA CIVILIANS

""The administration seeks to link Ukraine and Israel funding. This is a grave error that betrays a lack of strategic focus. Each conflict is distinct and represents a different claim on U.S. interests,"" the memo reads.
Vance outlined five main points: 1) Israeli operations will help secure the Gaza Strip; the Ukraine war has jeopardized the European security architecture and threatens global disorder; 2) Our political and military relationship with Israel is qualitatively different from our relationship with Ukraine; 3) Israel has a qualitatively different defense capability than Ukraine; 4) Israel has an achievable objective; Ukraine does not; 5) The U.S. does not have a plan in Ukraine, but we do have a plan in Israel. 
SENATE PREPARES FOR BIDEN TO SEND SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING REQUEST WITH ISRAEL, UKRAINE AID

""Israel has a clear plan, and we have a clear means of helping them to fulfill that plan — by providing very specific munitions to enable Israel to conduct a limited operation with a view to neutralizing the threat Hamas poses to Israel. We have no such plan for the Russia-Ukraine War,"" Vance wrote in the memo. 
""Our assistance to Ukraine is neither wellscoped nor secure, and includes funding for Ukrainian farmers, subsidies for Ukrainian small businesses, and payments for Ukrainian first responders,"" he added. 
Vance joins a growing choir of GOP lawmakers who are opposed to coupling the package. Instead, lawmakers want the package divvied out and voted on individually ahead of the Nov. 17 funding deadline.

In a letter sent to McConnell and Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Friday, a handful of GOP senators — including Vance — wrote: ""These are two separate conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to Israel in attempt to get additional aid for Ukraine across the finish line."" 
""Furthermore, it would be irresponsible and we should not risk a government shutdown by bundling these priorities together and thus complicating the process and lessening the likelihood of a funding package,"" the letter continued.
The funding proposal includes $61.4 billion for Ukraine; $14.3 billion for Israel (with $10.6 billion allocated for military aid); $13.6 billion for border protection (including measures to combat the flow of fentanyl); and significant investments in Indo-Pacific security assistance, totaling around $7.4 billion. Additionally, there's $9 billion earmarked for humanitarian aid in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza.

Israeli law enforcement investigates deadly terrorist attack outside of Jerusalem entrance. (Police Spokesperson’s Unit)

Three people are dead and 11 others are wounded after two Hamas terrorists opened fire
 on people at a bus station near Jerusalem Thursday morning, according to Israeli police.
Police responded to the Givat Shaul junction on the outskirts of Jerusalem at around 7:40 a.m. local time after two Palestinians arrived at the area in an armed vehicle and began shooting in the direction of civilians at a bus station.
The three killed have been identified as 73-year-old Rabbi Elimelech Wasserman, 67-year-old Hana Ifergan and 24-year-old Livia Dickman.
The two shooters, who were from east Jerusalem, were shot and killed by Israel Defense Forces soldiers in the area and a civilian. Israeli media said the shooters were brothers and associated with Hamas.

""The initial investigation indicates that the terrorists arrived to the scene by car in the morning, armed with an M-16 rifle and a handgun,"" a Jerusalem District Police spokesperson said. ""At a certain point, the terrorists began shooting at civilians before subsequently being killed at the scene. A police search of the terrorists' car revealed ammunition and weaponry.""
The eleven people wounded in the shooting have injuries ranging from moderate to severe, according to Israeli police. Three of the victims are said to be in serious condition after medical evaluations and four victims have non-physical injuries. The remaining four are believed to be moderate.

The area of the attack has been blocked off and searches have been initiated to rule out additional suspects, if any.
U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew condemned the shooting on X, formerly Twitter, Thursday morning.
""Abhorrent terrorist attack in Jerusalem this morning. We unequivocally condemn such brutal violence. My thoughts are with the families of the victims and I offer my sincere condolences to all those affected,"" he wrote.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. (GPO)

Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Thursday for his fourth visit to the Jewish State since Hamas launched its terror attack on Oct. 7.

Blinken first met with President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv where they discussed Thursday morning's shooting by Hamas terrorists at the entrance to Jerusalem that left at least 3 people dead and 16 wounded. The two terrorists were also killed.
The two also acknowledged the death of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, with Herzog describing the powerful diplomat as a ""giant"" and a ""titan.""
""We are big admirers of Henry Kissinger, who laid down the foundations of so many great decisions of his and processes which he has led, which has brought results that we feel until today, peaceful results,"" Herzog said. ""He laid the cornerstone of the peace agreement, which were later signed with Egypt, and so many other processes around the world. I admired Henry Kissinger.""
Blinken followed up by saying Kissinger ""set the standard"" for everyone in the Secretary of State role.

""I was very privileged to get his counsel many times, including as recently as about a month ago. He was extraordinarily generous with his wisdom, with his advice. Few people were better students of history – even fewer people did more to shape history – than Henry Kissinger,"" Blinken said.


Blinken then went to Jerusalem to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu privately.


Watch Greg Palkot's latest update from Israel Thursday morning.
The Israel Defense Forces announced Thursday morning that its temporary cease-fire deal with Hamas terrorists has been extended again. The announcement came minutes before the extended deal was set to expire at 7 a.m. local time.

""The operational pause will continue in light of the mediators' efforts to continue the process of releasing the hostages and subject to the terms of the framework,"" the IDF wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
The pause in fighting has been extended for one more day, according to Reuters, and the original deal allowing one hostage to be exchanged for three Palestinians detained in Israel still stands.

President Biden confirmed that Liat Beinin, a rescued Israel-American hostage, is safe after crossing the border from Gaza into Egypt.
""Ihave some very good news to report,"" Biden told a group of reporters. ""Liat Beinin is safe in Egypt, she's crossed the border.""

The president added that he has been in contact with Beinin's family.
""I talked with her mother and father,"" Biden continued. ""They're very appreciative, and things are moving well. She'll soon be home with her three children.""
""That's all I have to say for now,"" he added.


FOX News correspondent Mike Emanuel reported Wednesday on the rise in antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war.

According to Emanuel, Jewish students are filing lawsuits at colleges and universities where antisemitism is allegedly festering.
""In 2019, then-President Trump expanded Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act to include 'discrimination rooted in antisemitism,'"" Emanuel explained. ""Two Jewish groups are suing the University of California, Berkeley, saying the school violated federal civil rights laws and the Constitution by allowing 'unchecked antisemitism.'""
""The lawsuit cites inaction on discrimination and argues that UC Berkeley has become a hostile environment for Jewish students,"" he added.
In a statement to Fox News, UC Berkeley disputed the lawsuit said that they have 'been committed to confronting antisemitism.'""

A Thai hostage told Israeli media on Wednesday that Jewish captives were beaten by Hamas terrorists during their time in Gaza.
The hostage, whose name has not been released, told Israel's Channel 12 that captives were barely given food to eat, according to the Times of Israel.
He said that captives got a pita a day and occasionally a piece of cheese, and that four hostages often had to share a can of tuna.

“We were with Israelis, and they were guarded all the time,” the hostage reportedly said. “The Jews who were held with me were treated very harshly, sometimes they were beaten with electric cables.”
The captive also said that he was only allowed to shower once in the seven weeks he was held hostage.


Former CIA director Leon Panetta appeared on ""Your World"" Wednesday to discuss rowdy protests about the Israel-Hamas war in the United States.
Panetta told host Neil Cavuto that protests about the war shouldn't distract people from ""keep[ing] their eye on the ball.""

""Obviously, people in this country have the right to protest and to do it without any violence or disruption,"" he said. ""And that's something we accept in a free society. But I think the [Biden] administration and frankly, everybody, has to keep their eye on the ball.""
The former CIA official explained that the main two objectives of the war are to destroy Hamas and rescue all hostages.
""Whatever we can do to obviously get the hostages released as we had over these last number of days, I think is a good thing,"" Panetta continued. ""But at the same time, the focus here still has to be on destroying Hamas and making sure that that kind of attack never happens again.""
""I think that has to be the principal focus,"" he added.

Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres made a social media post condemning ""gender-based violence"" in the Israel-Hamas war on Wednesday, as reports have emerged of Hamas terrorists raping Israeli women.
""There are numerous accounts of sexual violence during the abhorrent acts of terror by Hamas on 7 October that must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted,"" Guterres wrote on X.
""Gender-based violence must be condemned. Anytime. Anywhere,"" he added.
Guterres has been criticized by Israel supporters for consistently criticizing the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) offensive in Gaza. He stressed earlier on Wednesday that Gazans have a ""right to live in peace and dignity.""

""The International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people is a moment to reaffirm their right to live in peace and dignity,"" Guterres' post on X read.
""It is long past time to move in a determined, irreversible way towards a two-State solution, on the basis of @UN resolutions and international law,"" he continued.

U.S. Navy officials say that an unmanned aircraft from Iran took ""unsafe and unprofessional actions"" near the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower on Tuesday.

“The Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group (IKECSG) was conducting routine flight operations in the international waters of the Central Arabian Gulf when it detected an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),"" the statement from U.S. Naval Forces Central Command Vice Adm. Brad Cooper read. ""The UAV was visually identified as Iranian. Its closest point of approach to IKE was approximately 1,500 yards.""
""Multiple hails and warnings were ignored by Iran,"" the press release added.
No injuries or damage were reported after the incident. Cooper called the actions ""unprofessional"" on Iran's part.
“This unsafe, unprofessional, and irresponsible behavior by Iran risks U.S. and partner nation lives and needs to cease immediately,"" Cooper added. ""U.S. naval forces remain vigilant and will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows while promoting regional maritime security.""

Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan holds up picture of the Palestinian Mufti with Adolf Hitler.

Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan spoke at a UN meeting on Wednesday, criticizing foreign ministers from Arab countries during his speech.
Erdan referenced the history of Israel and how the UN adopted the Partition Plan for Palestine during his remarks.
""On November 29, 1947, the UN voted to adopt the Partition Plan and the establishment of the Jewish State. Yet while Israel joyfully accepted this resolution, the Arab States rejected it, and instead, tried to annihilate Israel,"" Erdan explained. ""Today, exactly 76 years later, history is somewhat repeating itself.""

The ambassador accused Arab leaders of supporting Hamas, a terrorist organization, and presented a photograph of Palestinian leader Amin al-Husseini with Adolf Hitler.
""Foreign Ministers of some Arab countries have arrived here today in order to support a terror organization that aims to annihilate Israel, Erdan said. ""Thankfully, the plan to eliminate Israel was unsuccessful then, just as it will be unsuccessful today.""
""This picture tells you everything you need to know about this conflict,"" he added.

Jewish students at the University of Michigan are expressing concern over a referendum campaign orchestrated by their peers that accuses Israel of genocide amid the war-torn country's war with Hamas.

From Nov. 28 to 30, students at the University of Michigan are being given the opportunity to vote on two separate ballot measures – Assembly Resolution 13-025 (AR 13-025), which calls for the university to ""investigate their investments in any apartheid regime"" while recognizing ""the millions of people undergoing genocide in Gaza as we speak,"" and Assembly Resolution 13-026 (AR 13-026), which criticizes Hamas while condemning ""the rise in Islamophobia, Antisemitism, and other forms of hate speech"" amid the war.
Earlier this month, the Central Student Government at the university voted down (AR 13-025), the anti-Israel measure, when it was presented as a petition at the Assembly’s Oct. 31 meeting, according to The Michigan Review, one of the school's newspapers. The CSG's decision – with six voting in favor of the resolution, 21 voting against it, and three abstaining – sent the resolution to the student body for a vote.

Pro-Palestinian supporters in Northern California defended Hamas during a city council debate on a resolution calling for a permanent cease-fire with some even denying the atrocities committed by the terror group on Oct. 7.

The Oakland City Council unanimously passed the resolution 8-0 in a special meeting as hundreds of people spoke on the issue amid nearly five hours of public input. The resolution, which was introduced by Councilmember Carroll Fife, also demands the release of all hostages, unrestricted entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the restoration of critical infrastructure like water, electricity and food.
""I want Jewish children to live as much as I want Palestinian children to live,"" Fife said.

Abbey Onn, an Israeli woman who is related to two of the newly-released hostages, appeared on ""America Reports"" to discuss the recent developments of the Israel-Hamas war.

Onn added that she was told not to ""interrogate"" the children about their experience in captivity.
""The instructions that we've gotten have to not ask them any questions, not interrogate them and let them talk at their own will,"" she explained. And so we're kind of waiting for them to take the lead.""
""We know without detail that this was a horrific experience and just terrifying,"" she added. ""And so we are making sure that they have all the space and all the love that they need.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing pressure from within his government to end the cease-fire with Hamas and resume the military campaign in Gaza.
Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir issued an ultimatum to Netanyahu on social media on Wednesday, saying the current coalition government would dissolve if the war against Hamas is halted. Officials from the U.S., Israel and Qatar are in negotiations regarding a second extension of the cease-fire with Hamas.
Israel and Hamas
 have paused their fighting for six days, exchanging Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Netanyahu is facing mounting pressure from international organizations and even the U.S. to accept a long-term cease-fire agreement.
Such an agreement would put an end to hopes of dismantling Hamas and ending the terrorist organization's leadership in Gaza, something Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to do.

The Israel Defense Forces say two Israel-Russian hostages have been released from Hamas' custody in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday.
The International Committee of the Red Cross first received the hostages before they crossed into Israeli territory, according to the IDF.

The hostages have been identified as Irena Tatti, 73 and her 50-year-old daughter Elena Trufanova.
""IDF special forces and Israel Security Agency forces are currently with the two released hostages inside Israeli territory,"" the IDF said. ""After the released hostages undergo an initial medical assessment, IDF soldiers will continue to accompany them to hospitals, where they will be reunited with their families.""
The release comes as at least eight additional hostages are expected to still be freed Wednesday as part of a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas, which is set to expire in just hours.

More than a dozen Democratic senators visited the White House this week,
 where they discussed the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the impact it has had on Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and what steps the Biden administration would take after the temporary cease-fire expires. 
U.S. Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, and Jack Reed, D-R.I., were joined by over a dozen of their Democratic colleagues for a meeting with White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday. The named lawmakers then released a statement on Wednesday detailing what was discussed. 
According to the statement, the senators condemned the terror attacks
 by Hamas, expressed support for funds to immediately replenish Israel’s defensive systems, and tasked the White House with detailing its plan to support Israel in a way that advances U.S. interests. 
""We continue to support additional assistance to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks – but we are all in agreement that this assistance must be consistent with our interests and values and used in a manner that adheres to international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and U.S. law,"" the Democrats said.
They added: ""We need to find a better path toward helping Israel achieve legitimate military and security objectives. U.S. assistance has never come in the form of a blank check – regardless of the recipient.""

The leader of the Israel Defense Forces on Wednesday has approved planes for the continuation of fighting in the war against Hamas.
Israeli army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said ""We know what needs to be done, and are ready for the next step,"" according to IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.
""The Chief of Staff today approved plans for the continuation of fighting in the Southern Command together with the Commander of the Southern Command and members of the General Staff Forum, in which he approved the attack plans for the continuation of the maneuver,"" Hagari wrote on X.
The announcement comes as a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is set to expire soon.
Negotiators are trying to once again extend the agreement, which first went into effect Friday.

One of the first Israeli hostages to have been freed by Hamas is now saying she confronted the terrorist group's Gaza leader in a tunnel underneath the Gaza Strip during her time in captivity.

Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, told the Israeli newspaper Davar that Yahya Sinwar paid the hostages a visit and ""was with us three to four days after we arrived,"" according to Reuters.
""I asked him how he is not ashamed to do such a thing to people who all these years have supported peace,"" she reportedly said. ""He didn't answer. He was silent.""
Prior to their capture from their home in the Nir Oz kibbutz near the Israel-Gaza border, Yocheved and her husband Oded -- who remains in captivity -- were activists who helped sick Gazans receive medical care in Israel, her grandson Daniel Lifshitz previously has told Reuters. 

""They are human rights activists, peace activists for all their life,"" Daniel Lifshitz was quoted as saying.

An Israeli government spokesperson said Wednesday that 161 hostages remain held by the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas inside of the Gaza Strip. 
Eylon Levy told reporters that the figure includes 146 Israelis and 15 foreigners, of whom 126 are men and 35 are women. There are still four children under the age of 18, and 10 people aged 75 and older. 

“We want to get all of the hostages home, we’re committed to that pledge, there will be no one left behind,” Levy was quoted by the Associated Press as saying at a news conference. 
“The current framework allows for a few more days of hostage relief pause, and as long as there is a serious offer on the table to release the remaining hostages as we are demanding, we will of course consider every serious proposal because we’re committed to doing everything to bring them back,” he said. 
Another set of hostages is expected to be released by Hamas Wednesday before the ongoing cease-fire deal expires.

An internal reminder went out to Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) staff Wednesday about social media posts that could be construed as political, Fox News has confirmed. 

This internal reminder came after reports surfaced that a senior CIA officer had posted a pro-Palestinian image on social media two weeks after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.  
In a statement to Fox News, the CIA said its officers are committed to ""analytic objectivity."" 
""CIA officers may have personal views, but this does not lessen their — or CIA’s — commitment to unbiased analysis,"" the agency said.

Israeli DJs have staged a memorial concert called ""The Set for the Angels"" at the site of the music festival in southern Israel that was attacked by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7.
Five DJs played music Tuesday in front of rows of placards showing the faces of those killed in the attack that launched the Israel-Hamas war, according to Reuters.
""It's strange to see that all these people, all these pictures, are pictures of people that actually died here,"" Yahel Irony, an 18-year-old who survived the massacre, told the news agency. ""Those people danced with me and they didn't survive.""
Police say 364 people were killed at the Nova music festival near Kibbutz Reim while another 40 were taken hostage by Hamas, Reuters reports.
""I believe that each one of these people celebrated life and they wanted us to celebrate for them, with music,"" Asher Swissa, one of the DJs that performed at Tuesday's event, told Reuters.


As more of the Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attack in southern Israel are freed as part of a U.S.-Qatari-Egyptian brokered cease-fire deal, stories of the horrors endured during their 50-plus days in captivity are slowly coming to light.
Instead of the usual chatter, crying and laughing typical in pediatric wards, Dr. Yael Mozer Glassberg, a senior physician in the Department of Returned Children at the Schneider Medical Center in Tel Aviv, who is part of the specially assembled team of professionals tasked with treating the returned hostages, told Fox News Digital, ""It is very, very quiet here.""

Mozer Glassberg, who usually heads the hospital’s liver transplant unit, said so far, she and her team have worked with 22 of the freed hostages, including 15 children, in a specially created ward.
While most of the returned hostages appeared to be physically stable, many lost up to 15% of their body weight during captivity, and all are afraid to raise their voices after their 50-day stay with terrorists.
""At the moment they are being wrapped and hugged by family members and by the psycho-social medical team,"" Mozer Glassberg said.

Israel has announced Wednesday that a terrorist group commander has been killed during a military operation in the West Bank. 
Muhammad Zabeidi, whom the Jerusalem Post says leads the Jenin branch of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, was taken out in the operation conducted by the Israel Defense Forces, the Israeli Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel’s border patrol, according to the IDF. 
A joint statement from the three agencies said Zabeidi, who was “one of the main terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp, was involved in extensive terrorist activity and carried out shooting attacks as well as promoted other attacks of various types.” 

""Also, during the operation, 17 wanted persons were arrested and during searches for weapons, the forces located and confiscated seven weapons, improvised explosive devices, ammunition and military equipment,"" the statement continued. 
""During the activity, exchanges of fire developed and explosives were thrown at the forces who shot at the terrorists and hit them,"" it added. 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday has called for an international conference to resolve the Israel-Hamas war. 
He said Palestinians are ready to work with the international community on a “serious political process” that leads to an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war, according to the Associated Press. 

He also again called for a halt to the war in Gaza. 
Abbas’ Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
Hamas drove his forces out of Gaza when it seized power there in 2007. 
The war between Israel and Hamas, which began on Oct. 7 following a surprise terrorist attack in southern Israel, is now in its 53rd day. 
The Associated Press contributed to this report. 
Negotiators are pushing Israel and Hamas to extend their cease-fire for a second time Wednesday as the brief pause agreement enters its sixth and final day.
Israel and Hamas have so far agreed to one more exchange of Israeli hostages
 for Palestinian prisoners, having extended the cease-fire for two days beyond its original end date of Monday. Israeli leaders have vowed the destruction of Hamas in Gaza, but it is unclear when that campaign will resume.
""How far both sides will be prepared to go in trading hostages and prisoners for the pause is about to be tested, but the pressures and incentives for both to stick with it are at the moment stronger than the incentives to go back to war,"" Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, wrote on X.
CIA director William Burns and Mossad chief David Barnea negotiated with Qatari officials regarding an extension of the cease-fire throughout Tuesday as well. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also expected to push for a longer cease-fire when he visits Israel and the West Bank this week.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that America wants the Israel-Hamas cease-fire to continue.
“With regard to the pause, look, we'd like to see the pause extended because what it is enabled first and foremost is hostages being released. It's also enabled us to surge humanitarian assistance into the people of Gaza,” Blinken told reporters. “So it's continuation, by definition means that more hostages would be coming home, more assistance would be getting in. So clearly, that's something we want, I believe it's also something that that Israel wants.”
When asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s apprehension towards a two state solution, Blinken said that was a work in progress as well.
“These are conversations that we'll pursue in the days ahead in the weeks ahead, in the months ahead,” he said.

The current cease-fire between 
Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip is set to expire at midnight tonight (5 p.m. ET) if the two sides can’t come to an agreement on an extension. 
The cease-fire began last Friday and was extended by two days earlier this week. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said last week that the ""release of every additional ten hostages will result in one additional day in the pause"" in the fighting. 
""The Government of Israel, the IDF and the security services will continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza,"" Netanyahu's office added, suggesting that fighting will resume whenever the agreement expires. 
Meanwhile, Hamas has said ""we affirm that our victorious brigades and all our resistance factions will remain the protective shield and defender of our people until the occupation and aggression are defeated.""  
""We promise our people that we will remain loyal to their blood, their sacrifices, their patience, their bond, and their aspirations for liberation, freedom, the restoration of rights, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, with God’s will,"" Hamas added.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been a vocal critic of Israel since the war against Hamas started, is now calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the “butcher of Gaza.” 
Erdogan on Wednesday also reiterated that his government would ensure that Israel is held accountable for its military actions before international courts, accusing Netanyahu of committing “one of the worst atrocities” of the century, according to the Associated Press. 
“With the murders he committed in Gaza, Netanyahu is firing up antisemitism and endangering the security of the people of Israel and of all Jewish people,” Erdogan reportedly said. “Immigrants living in [Western] countries are paying the price for the irresponsible rhetoric of Western leaders that demonize Palestinians.” 
Turkey in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7 had denounced the violence and condemned deaths caused by the group, but as Israel rolled out its response, Erdogan shifted his support and started to refer to Hamas as ""freedom fighters.""  
Israel’s Foreign Ministry previously has said that ""Erdogan’s attempt to defend a terrorist organization and his inflammatory statements won’t change the horrors seen by the world that proves Hamas is ISIS."" 

Fox News’ Peter Aitken and Reuters contributed to this report. 
The Israel Defense Forces issued a ""daily message"" to residents of Gaza with safety instructions amid a temporary cease-fire deal that includes swapping Hamas hostages for Palestinians detained in Israel.

The IDF reminded Palestinians to not move to northern Gaza as it is still considered a war zone, adding that it is OK to move south of Wadi Gaza via the Salah al-Din Road.
""It is forbidden to approach within a kilometer of the border,"" the IDF wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Entry into the sea is prohibited.""
The IDF said the instructions have been issued for the safety of civilians.


The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that has resulted in a swap of Hamas hostages for Palestinians detained in Israeli jails could be extended up to four more days, according to FOX News' Greg Palkot.

Live in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, Palkot shared that talks are underway to extend the temporary pause in fighting that is set to expire today.
As of Wednesday, Hamas has released 60 Israeli women and children and 21 people of other nationalities. There are believed to be 159 hostages still in custody of Hamas or other terrorist groups.
In exchange for the hostages, 180 Palestinians detained in Israeli jails have been released.

Harvard student organizations claim Israel ‘entirely responsible’ for Gaza attacks,2023-10-09,Fox News,['Lindsay Kornick'],"IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Res. Jonathan Conricus joins FOX News Live to shares details on the aftermath of Hamas terror attacks on Israeli communities. 
More than two dozen Harvard student organizations declared in a statement on Saturday that Israel was ""entirely responsible"" for the violence occurring in its war against Gaza.
Iranian-backed Hamas soldiers launched a series of deadly attacks across southern Israel, which has since ignited into a war leaving over 1,100 people dead and thousands more injured. The number of Israeli civilians and soldiers that were taken hostage is still unknown.
Shortly after the attacks, Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups released its statement signed by 27 different organizations that blamed Israel entirely for the attacks and voiced support for Palestinians in Gaza.
""We, the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,"" the statement began.

AT LEAST 1100 DEAD, ISRAELI PM NETANYAHU DECLARES ‘WAR’ AFTER HAMAS TERRORISTS LAUNCH MASSIVE ATTACK 
It continued, ""Today’s events did not occur in a vacuum. For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison. Israeli officials promise to ‘open the gates of hell,’ and the massacres in Gaza have already commenced. Palestinians in Gaza have no shelters for refuge and nowhere to escape. In the coming days, Palestinians will be forced to bear the full brunt of Israel’s violence."" 
Among the groups listed in the statement included the Harvard Islamic Society, the Harvard Jews for Liberation, the Society of Arab Students and the Harvard Divinity School Muslim Association.
The statement also attacked the ""apartheid regime"" in Israel that has forced Palestinians into ""colonial retaliation"" and called on action to protect them.
""The apartheid regime is the only one to blame. Israeli violence has structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years. From systematized land seizures to routine airstrikes, arbitrary detentions to military checkpoints, and enforced family separations to targeted killings, Palestinians have been forced to live in a state of death, both slow and sudden,"" it read.

The statement, concluded, ""Today, the Palestinian ordeal enters into uncharted territory. The coming days will require a firm stand against colonial retaliation. We call on the Harvard community to take action to stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians.""
Fox News Digital reached out to the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee for a comment.
‘TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE’ TO RETRIEVE HOSTAGES: COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERT ISSUES URGENT WARNING OVER ISRAEL WAR 
Harvard professor emeritus Laurence Tribe also recently received backlash after initially posting a conspiracy theory regarding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly after the attack.
""Is Netanyahu wagging the dog of war to take attention away from his own war on the independent judiciary? Can anyone put that past him?"" he wrote on X. He later deleted the post.
Fox News Digital reached out to Tribe for comment, and he responded with this explanation: ""I sent the tweet in response to Netanyahu’s reported comments before I saw the news of what Hamas had actually done, at which point I immediately deleted the tweet as a clearly premature, ill-informed and inappropriate response to incomplete information.""

He added, ""I obviously condemn Hamas’s terrorist attacks and unthinkable atrocities against the Israeli people, including the murder and abduction of civilians, in the strongest possible terms and fully support Israel’s right of self-defense, notwithstanding my long-standing condemnation of the Israeli occupation of Gaza and its activities in the West Bank.""

Columbia suspends anti-Israel student groups for ‘threatening rhetoric and intimidation’,2023-11-10,Fox News,['David Rutz'],"Outkick founder Clay Travis reacts to Columbia University suspending two anti-Israel student groups on 'The Story.'
Columbia University is suspending the far-left groups Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) as official student groups through the end of the fall term, it announced on Friday, saying they had violated university policies.
The university said it made the decision after the groups ""repeatedly violated University policies related to holding campus events, culminating in an unauthorized event Thursday afternoon that proceeded despite warnings and included threatening rhetoric and intimidation."" It marks the second university to take action against SJP in recent days, with Brandeis University banning the group this week for its statements supporting Hamas. 
Gerald Rosberg, Senior Executive Vice President of the University, released a statement explaining Columbia's decision.
""Suspension means the two groups will not be eligible to hold events on campus or receive University funding.  Lifting the suspension will be contingent on the two groups demonstrating a commitment to compliance with University policies and engaging in consultations at a group leadership level with University officials,"" he wrote.

""Like all student groups, SJP and JVP are required to abide by University policies and procedures. This ensures both the safety of our community and that core University activities can be conducted without disruption. During this especially charged time on our campus, we are strongly committed to giving space to student groups to participate in debate, advocacy, and protest. This relies on community members abiding by the rules and cooperating with University administrators who have a duty to ensure the safety of everyone in our community.""
In response, the groups released a joint statement on X Friday.
""You can shut our organizations down, but can't stop our hearts from beating for liberation, humanity, and the freedom of Palestine. Our actions will be louder than our words, for all the people who are yearning for freedom, and for the media outlets: Keep an eye on Columbia.""
On Thursday, the anti-Israel groups organized a walkout that included demands that the university call Israel's actions against Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack a ""genocide."" It also included a ""die-in"" demonstration.
""University event policy generally requires groups to apply for permits at least 10 days in advance of any demonstration or protest in order to hold events on school grounds,"" student newspaper the Columbia Spectator reported.
JEWISH COLUMBIA STUDENTS FACED WITH THREATS, ATTACKS SPEAK OUT, SAY SOME PROTESTERS AREN'T FULLY EDUCATED
According to the Spectator, Rosberg met with students Wednesday participating in a sit-in at the School of Social Work and ""called in University delegates to tell participants they were in violation of a rule in the University code of conduct which prohibits actions that ‘interrupt, shout down, or otherwise disrupt an event or to obstruct the view of the speaker.’""
The Columbia chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine celebrated the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,400 in southern Israel, many of them civilians, women and children, calling it ""an unprecedented historic moment for the Palestinians of Gaza."" It added to critics of the violence that ""nothing else is working"" so bloodshed would continue due to the situation.
The announcement of the suspensions drew extensive attention online, with some pro-Israel voices cheering the move, while pro-Palestinian voices denounced it as censorship.
""Columbia University's decision to suspend Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace is a betrayal of the values for which the school, my alma mater, ostensibly stands,"" one alumnus wrote.
Like many other elite institutions, Columbia's response to the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas has been under the microscope. One professor went viral for decrying the response by the school to instances of campus antisemitism. A Jewish student was also attacked with a stick after objecting to a woman tearing down posters of Hamas hostages.
A Jewish billionaire and philanthropist, Henry Swieca, also resigned from the Board of Columbia Business School last month, claiming the Ivy League institution had expressed a ""moral cowardice"" that left Jews feeling unsafe on campus. Swieca called the recent Hamas attacks against Israel ""revolting"" and said that statements from the school are ""meaningless"" when ""pro-Hamas students"" are allowed to march on campus yelling slogans that call for the destruction of the Jewish state.
The New York Post reported last month more than 100 Columbia professors signed a letter defending pro-Palestinian students who had defended the Hamas attack on Israel and asked administrators to stop making statements ""that favor the suffering and death of Israelis or Jews over the suffering and deaths of Palestinians.""

Columbia didn't respond to a request for comment. Fox News Digital has also reached out to Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine for comment.

Black former Miss Israel tears into BLM for backing Palestinians: ‘How could you support this evil?’,2023-10-19,Fox News,['Charles Creitz'],"Yityish 'Titi' Aynaw joins 'Jesse Watters Primetime' to call out Black Lives Matter's silence on slaughter of Jewish civilians. 
The first Black woman to be crowned Miss Israel told FOX News she has become disillusioned with Black Lives Matter, lambasting them for their silence on Hamas terrorists' butchering of Israeli civilians while they throw their support behind Palestinians. 
Yityish ""Titi"" Aynaw said Wednesday she was horrified by an alleged BLM-affiliated poster that featured the slogan ""I stand with Palestine"" below an image of a hang-gliding humanoid and a Palestinian flag. Hamas deployed armed terrorists via hang-gliders to murder attendees to an Israeli music festival earlier in October.
While BLM Chicago admitted ""we aren't proud of"" the image after the fact, they added that they ""stand with Palestine & the people who will do what they must to live free,"" according to the New York Post, which cited a social media post.

""I just saw their post… for them supporting Palestinians. Let's say it's OK, but for them not saying anything about 1,400 civilians who were murdered by Hamas, and for them not saying anything about women who was raped by the terrorists, for them not saying anything when they heard that they're slaughtering babies in Israel, and they say they care about Black people, they say they care about human rights — what about my rights as a Black woman in Israel?"" she asked on ""Jesse Watters Primetime.""
Aynaw said Israel is home to a large Black-Jewish community and that it was shocking to see the group fail to speak out against the dangers facing Black-Israeli lives.
When asked if BLM is a ""fraud,"" Aynaw replied they are at least ""hypocrites.""
""If you support human rights, you're supposed to stand with Israel,"" she said. 
""So for me, they don't represent ‘Black Lives Matter.' They don't care.""
GRAHAM TO SQUAD: ‘SHUT THE HELL UP’
Meanwhile, a 2021 VICE News interview with a Hamas warlord resurfaced in the wake of the terror attacks, particularly a snippet in which the terror group official compared the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis to alleged ""racism"" by Israel against Palestinians.
""George Floyd was killed as a result of a racist ideology held by some people. The same type of racism that killed George Floyd is being used… against the Palestinians in Jerusalem, Sheikh Jarrah [Palestinian-majority neighborhood in East Jerusalem], and in the West Bank,"" said Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' Gaza chief.
Aynaw rejected Sinwar's claims, saying no one should support or weigh the proclamations of terrorist organizations or their officials.
She compared Hamas to the Nazi regime in Germany and said no one on the right side of history supported 1930s Berlin, either.

""How the world can support this kind of evil, this is what I don't understand,"" she added.
In previous comments, Aynaw said ""Hamas is ISIS"" and recounted how BLM shouted the slogan, ""I can't breathe"" following George Floyd's death, saying that people should ""pray for Israel because we can't breathe.""

"Biden calls on world to condemn Hamas sexual violence, blames terror group for collapse of cease-fire",2023-12-06,Fox News,['Chris Pandolfo'],"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers remarks as the conflict with Hamas continues almost two months after the Oct. 7 attack.
President Biden said Tuesday that Hamas had repeatedly raped women and mutilated their bodies during the Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel, citing accounts from survivors and witnesses to the attacks.
While at a political fundraiser in Boston, the president called on the world to condemn the ""unimaginable cruelty"" of Hamas' sexual violence ""without exception."" 
""Reports of women raped — repeatedly raped — and their bodies being mutilated while still alive, of women's corpses being desecrated, Hamas terrorists inflicting as much pain and suffering on women and girls as possible and then murdering them. It is appalling,"" Biden said, according to Reuters.
Israeli police are investigating possible sexual crimes by some of the few hundred Hamas members that they arrested after the Oct. 7 attack. Israel's justice ministry said ""victims were tortured, physically abused, raped, burned alive and dismembered.""

Israel put on an event at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Monday to expose the sexual violence against women that took place during the Oct. 7 attack. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres last week called for investigations into reports of rape and sexual assaults committed by Hamas after weeks of silence on the issue — which Israel harshly condemned. 
Israeli officers on Monday shared their experiences in recovering women’s bodies after the massacre on Oct. 7, showing girls with broken pelvises; women and girls without clothing and covered in blood; women and girls’ bodies with shooting wounds targeted at sexual organs; breast amputations; naked women and girls’ in showers with their hands tied behind their backs; additional amputation of genitalia and more.

The United Nations will investigate sexual violence Israel claims Hamas terrorists committed against Israeli women and girls during their invasion on Oct. 7, satisfying a long-requested plea from Israel.
U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said Wednesday that such reports of rape and sexual assault ""must be vigorously investigated,"" breaking weeks of silence on the issue.
""There are numerous accounts of sexual violence during the abhorrent acts of terror by Hamas on 7 October that must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted,"" Guterres said. His statement added: ""Gender-based violence must be condemned. Anytime. Anywhere.""
The statement came as Israel has demanded for more than 50 days for the United Nations and its human rights groups to investigate the alleged sexual violence.

Guterres’ statement was met with swift criticism from Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan, who said the secretary-general was trying to satisfy critics.
""The Secretary-General’s words only sharpen the fact that when it comes to Israeli women, sexual violence that has been proven by state authorities still needs to be ‘investigated,'"" Erdan said. ""For him, when it comes to Israeli women, you can doubt the facts and wait 55 days to call an unknown party to conduct an ‘investigation.’""

Earlier this week, Israel attempted to get the United Nations to recognize and condemn Hamas’ alleged actions against Israeli women and girls during a meeting in Geneva.
At the event, Israeli officials urged the international body – which often condemns human rights violations – not to keep quiet about the issue.

""Among the war crimes and the crimes against humanity that Hamas committed on Oct. 7 were also sexual crimes, sexual assaults, rapes, that were part, that were a systematic part of their attack, of the massacre, and we are expecting a strong condemnation,"" she told Reuters. ""We expected recognition of that. We expected a clear and loud statement that says that there is no justification for using the bodies of women as a weapon of war. None of this came up until now.""

The professor said she was ""deeply concerned because of the complete lack of acknowledgment, of recognition by United Nations bodies and entities and by the international human rights world, lack of recognition that indeed Hamas committed horrific sexual crimes against women, against women and girls, on Oct. 7 in Israel.""
Guterres did not provide specifics on when the investigation would begin or how long it would continue.

"GOP lawmaker targets pro-Hamas protests on college campuses, Dept of Education: ‘Deep rot of antisemitism’",2023-10-23,Fox News,['Andrew Mark Miller'],"Multiple pro-Palestinian student groups hosted a march and ""die-in"" at Harvard Business School recently in protest of Israel’s ""genocide"" of Palestinians in Gaza.
FIRST ON FOX: Republican Congressman Burgess Owens has introduced a resolution condemning the support Hamas has received on college campuses nationwide following its attack on Israel that left over 1,400 citizens dead.
The resolution, supported by dozens of Republican members of Congress, ""condemns the support of Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations at institutions of higher education, which may lead to the creation of a hostile environment for Jewish students, faculty, and staff; and urges the Secretary of Education to direct the Office for Civil Rights to investigate and, where appropriate, take action immediately.""
""I never thought I'd see American students celebrate a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people,"" the Utah Republican who chairs the Higher Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee, said in a press release.
""Elite institutions have failed their students and alumni by offering inadequate statements of condemnation. This has exposed the deep rot of antisemitism in our higher education system, from statements placing blame solely on Israel for the atrocities of Hamas to demonstrations glorifying mass murder, rape, torture, and kidnapping. It is not nuanced or difficult to stand against terror.""

I thank Congressman Owens for introducing this resolution to condemn the support of terrorist organizations at colleges and universities that places the safety of Jewish students, faculty, and staff at risk."" 
Following the Hamas attack on Israel earlier this month that killed over 1,400 Israelis, protests condemning Israel have erupted on college campuses across the country, including at Harvard University, where calls have intensified for the school's president to step down over her response to the protests.

Israel has, so far, issued warnings to civilians in areas of Gaza City and others where they intend to strike. The warnings have given civilians moments to evacuate so as to reduce the number of civilian deaths.
Hamas has threatened to start executing captured Israelis if strikes targeted civilians without warning. Israel said that Hamas is holding more than 150 soldiers and civilians hostage in Gaza.
The war is only expected to escalate as Israel could launch a ground invasion to eradicate Hamas from Gaza.
On Tuesday morning, Israel’s military said it regained effective control over areas near the Gaza Strip border with Israel, which was breached over the weekend in Saturday's surprise attack.
The Israeli military also said it recovered the bodies of roughly 1,500 Hamas militants on Israeli territory.

"Israeli police say extreme sexual violence, rape by Hamas terrorists was systematic",2023-11-18,Fox News,['Ruth Marks Eglash'],"ZAKA Commander Yossi Landau describes how Hamas tortured Israeli women and children on 'America Reports.'
JERUSALEM — The first suggestion that Hamas terrorists committed acts of extreme sexual violence and rape against victims during their Oct. 7 rampage through southern Israel came on social media early on that fateful Saturday morning six weeks ago. 
Two short videos, shared by the terrorists themselves, quickly emerged showing groups of cheering Palestinian men, some armed, in the streets of Gaza crowding around half-naked and bloodied young Israeli women.
In one clip, a woman later identified as German-Israeli citizen Shani Louk, 22, can be seen barely clothed lying unconscious in an unnatural position on the flatbed of a pickup as men spit and abuse her body while screaming ""Allahu Akhbar.""
In another video, 19-year-old Israeli soldier Na’ama Levy is pulled from the back of a jeep by an armed gunman, her hands bound behind her back and  thick blood stains between her legs, as Palestinian men jeer at her.

Louk is now counted among the 1,200 people murdered that day, and Levy is thought to be one of an estimated 240 hostages, including babies and children, being held by the terror group inside the Palestinian enclave. 
While the victims of gender-based crimes committed during that brutal attack have yet to come forward, either because they were murdered or kidnapped or are still reeling from the trauma, the Israeli police and Israel’s newly formed Civil Commission on October 7th Crimes by Hamas Against Women believe sexual violence during the terror attack was widespread, systematic and even endorsed by the Islamic fundamentalist group’s religious and spiritual leaders as permissible during war. 
Yet collecting the evidence for this intimate aspect of such a massive, multilevel terror attack, which sparked total chaos inside Israel and launched a full-scale war in the Gaza Strip, has proved challenging for criminal investigators. Those investigators hope to bring detailed charges against hundreds of Hamas terrorists now being held by Israel for their role in the assault and for women’s groups, who say that violent sexual crimes in war must be documented and remembered. 
""This is the biggest criminal case in Israel’s history,"" said David Katz, head of the Israeli police’s Lahav 443 criminal investigation’s cyber unit, which is investigating the criminal aspects of the mass atrocity.
""We are dealing with thousands of murders and other crimes,"" he said. He described how the crime scene, which included more than 20 locations, among them army bases, civilian communities and a sprawling music festival not far from Israel’s border with Gaza, was an active combat zone for the first 48 hours following the attack, hampering police efforts to collect forensic and other evidence.

In the aftermath of the surprise attack, police said, the nation’s main focus was on collecting and identifying hundreds of badly mutilated and burned bodies as quickly as possible. Jewish burials are meant to take place immediately. And, although medical teams worked 24 hours a day in the days and weeks that followed, carefully photographing and documenting some of the worst injuries they said they’d ever seen, the typical process for sexual-based crimes was largely overlooked.  
FOREIGN SURVIVORS OF BRUTAL HAMAS ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECALL TERROR MASSACRE : 'EVERYTHING WAS BURNING'
""We’re still only in the initial phases of this investigation,"" said Katz, describing how his team was working to collect statements from thousands of survivors. It was also going to examine more than 60,000 videos taken by the terrorists on phones and bodycams and other footage taken by victims, first responders, CCTV cameras and dashcams.
""At this time, there are no known living victims, and many of the surviving victims still cannot speak about what happened to them,"" said Katz, adding that much of the details were under a court-authorized gag order and could not be shared with the public. But he estimated that there were ""multiple"" cases of sexual violence.
At Tuesday’s briefing, the police screened one eyewitness account of a gang rape that she said took place at the Nova Music Festival, where more than 300 people were brutally murdered and thousands were injured by hundreds of heavily armed Hamas terrorists.

The witness, identified only by the initial ""S,"" recounted on camera that while she was hiding from the terrorists, she saw a group of them pass a woman with long brown hair among them. 
""I understood they were raping her,"" S said. ""They were passing her from one person to the next. She was alive and standing on her feet. She was bleeding from her back."" 
ISRAELI SURVIVORS OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK RECOUNT HARROWING BRUTALITY, HEROISM
S then described how one of the terrorists sliced off the woman’s breast and began playing around with it. Another, the witness said, shot the woman in the head while he was still penetrating her. 
""He did not even lift up his pants and shot her in the head,"" S said, adding that she spied another terrorist haul a naked, dead woman over his shoulder and walk off with her. Another, she said, cut off someone’s head and was walking around with it like a trophy.

Additionally, the police shared graphic photographs and video footage from the festival showing women, charred and bloody, their underwear visibly ripped and their legs spread apart.
Videotaped interrogations of some of the captured terrorists show them confessing that they had orders to murder, rape and kidnap Israeli civilians. One suspect told Israeli interrogators he and his men had received religious permission to kill children ""because they’ll grow up to be soldiers"" and to decapitate ""to sow fear among the Israelis.""
First responders from both the Israeli military and the country’s civilian services have described in detail the disturbing brutality and atrocities carried out by an estimated 3,000 Hamas and other Palestinian terrorists who entered Israel Oct. 7. 
A commander with the Israeli army’s National Rescue Unit told journalists in the initial days after the attack that he had found multiple bodies of dead women who had been stripped naked. In one case, on Kibbutz Be’eri, Col. (Res) Golan Vach, said he found two women tied together on the same bed with no clothes on. 
""I don’t know what happened to them before they were killed,"" he said. ""But I do know that most regular women go to bed wearing pajamas.""

In another case, a soldier from the army’s special forces unit who was sent to search for survivors on a kibbutz told one media outlet he found the dead bodies of two young girls together in one room.  
""There was a teenage girl, 14 or 15. She was lying on the floor, on her stomach, her pants were pulled down, and she was half naked. Her legs were spread out, wide open, and there was the remains of sperm on her back,"" he said. ""Someone executed her straight after he brutally raped her.
""It was like a slap in the face,"" the soldier said. ""It was the first time I realized that we are not acting against terrorists here, we are acting against savages.""
In the morgue, too, those working to identify the dead and prepare their bodies for burial spoke about brutalities consistent with rape and sexual assault. 
""We saw evidence of rape,"" Shari, who works with a team of female volunteers tasked with cleaning the bodies of murdered women, told Fox News Digital in a previous interview. ""Pelvises were broken, and it probably takes a lot to break a pelvis. … And this was also among grandmothers down to small children. These are things we saw with our own eyes.""

Speaking this week on a Zoom panel organized by the Maimonides Society at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Cochav Elkayam-Levy, chair of Israel’s newly formed Civil Commission on October 7th Crimes by Hamas Against Women, said her team had also been working to compile a database of gender-based atrocities ""to ensure that the Oct. 7 victims of sexual and other violence against women are never forgotten and that their stories are adequately told.""
Elkayam-Levy, a legal expert from Hebrew University added, ""We established the commission on the eighth day of the war as more and more evidence of gruesome crimes against women and children emerged,"" she told the panel.
She said that even though some of Hamas’ crimes, which were broadcast in real-time on social media, ""showed clear violations of international law and brutal crimes committed against women and children,"" there was little international condemnation. 
""Therefore, we took it upon ourselves to call for recognition and action,"" Elkayam-Levy said. ""We also realized that these crimes must be documented and brought to the attention of the international community.""

House Democrat responds to Jayapal’s controversial remarks on Hamas rape: ‘Indecent to downplay’ atrocities,2023-12-04,Fox News,['Hanna Panreck'],"Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres responded to Rep. Pramila Jayapal's comments on Hamas' sexual violence on Monday and said public officials have the responsibility to ""speak with clarity, rather than caveats.""
Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., responded to Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and other hard-left figures on Monday after she seemed unable to explain why there was a hesitation among some progressives to condemn Hamas' sexual violence against Israeli women. 
CNN's Dana Bash asked Torres why it was so difficult for progressives to ""unequivocally call out the barbaric sexual violence against Israeli women.""
""Look, there’s often been a double standard against Israel when it comes to condemning the sheer butchery and barbarism of Hamas,"" Torres said. ""Public officials have a moral obligation to speak with clarity rather than caveats. And I found it deeply troubling, for example, that the UN Women, the so-called women’s rights arm of the United Nations, went 50 days without commenting on or condemning the sexual atrocities that Hamas perpetrated against Israeli women. For me, this is not about politics. This is about decency. It is indecent to deny or downplay or ‘both sides’ the rape and sexual violence against Israeli women on October 7.""
Jayapal joined Bash on Sunday for an interview and was asked about the silence from progressive women's groups on Hamas' use of rape as a weapon of war. Jayapal, who chairs the left-wing Congressional Progressive Caucus, claimed she did condemn Hamas' treatment of women specifically and quickly turned the conversation back to Israel.

""With respect, I was just asking about the women, and you turned it back to Israel. I’m asking you about Hamas,"" Bash said. 
The lawmaker said she had already answered the question and added, ""we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians. Fifteen thousand Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air strikes, three-quarters of whom are women and children."" 
Other Democrats, including Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., also criticized Jayapal's comments. 
""Hamas terrorists raped Israeli women and girls. The only ‘balanced’ approach is to condemn sexual violence loudly, forcefully and without exceptions. Outrageous for anyone to ‘both sides’ sexual violence,"" Schultz wrote on social media.

UNITED NATIONS SLAMMED FOR SILENCE OVER HAMAS RAPES, MUTILATION AND MURDER OF ISRAELI WOMEN, CRITICS SAY
Dingell told CNN's Kasie Hunt that she condemned Hamas' rape of Israeli women the week after the initial attacks.
""I’m going to talk to Pramila, I have a call in to her. I think… I’m going to just speak for myself on this subject, and I’m raw on this subject because of the hate that I have had directed at me for speaking the truth. I will speak the truth. And I don’t care who it is. Rape is an act of violence and it becomes too often a tool in any act of war,"" she said.
Torres also criticized the ""fringe"" members of the Democratic caucus who were using language such as ""ethnic cleansing"" or ""genocide"" to describe Israel's response to Hamas' terrorist attacks.

President Biden denied the accuracy of casualty numbers provided by the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry on Wednesday.
Biden made the comments in response to questions from reporters during a join press conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Biden says he has ""no confidence"" in the ministry's claim that 6,546 Palestinians have been killed and 17,439 have been wounded since Oct. 7.
A reporter asked whether Hamas' statistics suggest that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is ignoring U.S. calls to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.
""What they say to me is that I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,"" Biden responded. ""I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's a price of waging a war.""

Norfolk Southern improves train safety despite rising costs linked to East Palestine derailment,2023-10-25,Fox News,[],"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The costs related to the East Palestine derailment continue to grow to reach $966 million for Norfolk Southern, but the railroad's service is improving and its insurance companies have started to pay their share of the cost of the crash in eastern Ohio early this year.
The Atlanta-based railroad said this year's third-quarter profit of $478 million, or $2.10 per share, was half of last year's $958 million, or $4.10 per share. The results were hurt by the derailment costs, a drop in its fuel surcharge revenue and flat volume.
Without the derailment costs, the railroad would have made $601 million, or $2.65 per share.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO… THE OHIO TRAIN DERAILMENT?

OFFICIALS REVEAL BEHIND-THE-SCENES DECISION TO VENT TOXIC CHEMICALS AFTER EAST PALESTINE TRAIN DERAILMENT
While the cleanup from the February derailment continues, the railroad collected its first $25 million payment from its insurers. Norfolk Southern expects its insurance companies to eventually cover most of the cost of the derailment that forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes and left residents with worries about possible long-term health effects.
The analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Norfolk Southern to report earnings per share of $2.64, on average.
But the average speed of Norfolk Southern's trains increased during the quarter to 20.5 mph. That's higher than last year's 19.1 mph average and also up from this year's low point of 18.7 mph in the second quarter when one of its main tracks was still closed because of the derailment for most of the period. The average amount of time the railroad's trains spend inside its railyards also decreased to 23.2 hours from last year's 25.9 hours and 28.1 hours in this year's second quarter.
TERRIFYING THINGS WE IN EAST PALESTINE STILL DON’T KNOW SINCE TRAIN DERAILMENT
The railroad's revenue declined 11% to $2.97 billion. That's just ahead of the $2.94 billion that Wall Street predicted.
Norfolk Southern now expects revenue to be down about 4% this year after fuel surcharge revenue fell $254 million in the third quarter
Norfolk Southern is one of the nation's largest railroads operating in the Eastern United States.

"MSNBC’s Velshi, guest say no one’s speaking to Israel’s ‘inhumane treatment’ of Palestine after Hamas attack",2023-10-07,Fox News,['Gabriel Hays'],"MSNBC host Ali Velshi and a Palestinian activist argued that people are not discussing the oppression Israel has shown towards Palestinians in the context of the recent attacks perpetrated by terror group Hamas against innocent Israelis.
MSNBC host Ali Velshi and a Palestinian activist argued that people are not keeping in mind the ""inhumane treatment"" Israel has shown towards Palestinians in the context of the recent attacks perpetrated by terror group Hamas against Israel. 
The MSNBC ""Velshi"" host brought the Palestinian analyst Nour Odeh to discuss the deadly attack against Israel and asserting how Hamas militants’ attack didn’t just come ""out of the blue,"" but was the result of tensions created by Israelis ""harassing"" Palestinians. 
Odeh agreed, listing many alleged ways Israel has been oppressing Palestinians up to this moment.

The segment followed the deadly Hamas attack that killed over 100 Israelis and injured nearly a thousand more in Israel Saturday. Responding to the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that his nation was ""at war"" with Hamas and vowed to strike back for the murder of innocent Israelis.
Bringing on Odeh, Velshi said, ""We have been reporting for the last ten months I guess, an increase in tensions between Israel and Palestinians who live in the occupied West Bank.""
The host continued, saying, ""There’s been a lot of misinformation about this, about many of these Palestinians who are being, as [MSNBC's] Ayman [Mohyeldin] said, systematically harassed and their homes demolished, harassed by settlers under the eye and guise, and with the support of Israeli defense forces.""
Making his point, he added, ""So this is not out of the blue, what we have seen this morning. It was a surprise for which Israel was not prepared, but tensions have been boiling for ten months.""
Odeh parroted Velshi’s claim, saying, ""Well, they’ve been boiling for over half a century, Ali, which is the length of the Israeli occupation.""

The activist then mention the alleged crimes that Israel has perpetrated in the last two years that have built to Hamas’ response. She noted a ""record number of Palestinian children killed by Israeli occupation forces, a record number of Palestinian homes demolished by Israel, a record number of Israeli settler attacks against Palestinian villages where homes and businesses were set on fire, where Palestinians were injured or killed by armed Israelis.""
After listing several other affronts by Israel, Odeh added, ""And to think that all of that wouldn’t have consequences, or wouldn’t have a reaction from the Palestinians, all Palestinians, was delusional.""
As the segment continued, Velshi noted that outside observers, namely American politicians and commentators, have had ""boilerplate"" assessments of what has happened. He declared, ""There’s no nuance or recognition of anything that’s been going on.""
He also accused Americans and other governments of ignoring ""Israel’s inhumane treatment of the Palestinians who live under Israeli occupation.""
The Palestinian activist agreed there as well, stating, ""Unfortunately you are right. American politicians and other politicians think they can just ignore the context in which all of this is happening, the fact that Israel is an occupying power, the fact that Israel has violated international law and Palestinian rights as per the experts – the leading UN agencies, leading human rights organizations around the world.""
Elsewhere, Odeh added, ""The fact is there is an entire people who are living under the boot of the Israeli army. They don’t want to do that anymore and they’ve tried everything.""

"Hamas preventing Gaza residents from fleeing to safety, Palestinian activist says",2023-10-27,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"FOX News’ Trey Yingst reports on Israeli efforts to warn Gaza civilians to evacuate further southward.
Hamas reportedly urges residents of northern Gaza to ignore the warnings from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and not leave the area as the terrorist group continues to try and use civilians as human shields. 
Palestinian human rights activist and political analyst Bassem Eid told Fox News Digital that Hamas has physically restrained and blocked people from leaving northern Gaza, sending their own security forces and ""pushing people back into their houses, not allowing them to move.""
""Unfortunately, sometimes we have more and more casualties among the Palestinians because of such kind of attitude and behavior of Hamas,"" Eid said. 
""They are physically … and trying even sometimes by force to push people back, closing the entrances of the villages or the cities or the neighborhoods over there, just standing over there and not allowing for people to move out,"" he continued. ""So I can say that they are forcing people – they never ask people to remain in their places, but they are forcing people not to get out of their homes.""

The IDF has maintained a campaign of precision strikes with air raids and shelling into the Gaza Strip following the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, which killed at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers, 7,000 Palestinians – including 2,913 minors, according to the Hamas-backed Gaza Health Ministry – and 33 Americans.

Keeping with their standard procedure, the IDF has issued warnings to residents of the northern part of Gaza to evacuate ahead of a much-anticipated ground invasion of the territory, telling residents that they would be safe in southern Gaza. 
Eid stressed that the IDF only provides warning and does not assist in evacuation in any way. Israeli Air Force planes dropped leaflets over the cities in northern Gaza urging residents to flee south and telling them where they could gather to remain safe.  
The Wall Street Journal reported that Hamas terrorists continue to hide in tunnels underneath homes and hospitals in Gaza City.

Audio released yesterday by the IDF on its official X social media account, formerly known as Twitter, reportedly recorded a conversation between an IDF officer in Unit 504 urging a resident in Gaza to leave the area. The resident, identified as Muhammad, claims that he cannot leave because Hamas is ""sending everyone back home."" 
The IDF released a press statement regarding Hamas’s use of Gaza Strip residents as ""human shields,"" insisting that the officers of Unit 504 have continued to notify residents across the northern part of the territory to evacuate to the south ""for their safety."" 
""The Hamas terrorist organization continues to use the civilians of Gaza as human shields and is not allowing them to evacuate to the south,"" the IDF wrote. ""As we have seen in the past, they use a variety of methods, including roadblocks.""

Israel recaptures areas near the Gaza Strip overrun by Hamas,2023-10-09,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"FOX News contributor Kiron Skinner offers her analysis on the Hamas terror attacks in Israel on 'FOX News Live.'
All of Israel is under the control of the Israeli military, Fox News learned Monday morning.
Israeli forces recaptured areas near the Gaza Strip that had been overrun in a Hamas mass-infiltration over the weekend, Reuters reported. The Israeli Defense Force re-established control of communities but isolated clashes remain throughout the country, a military spokesperson said on Monday. 
Rabbi Aryeh Lightstone, a former senior advisor to David Friedman, spoke to Fox News Monday morning from a bomb shelter, where he confirmed the IDF had recaptured the occupied areas.

On Monday, Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a ""complete siege"" on the Gaza Strip in retaliation for the strikes and as fighting continues.
""I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip,"" Gallant said at the IDF Southern Command in Beersheba. ""There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.""
Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said Monday his country would immediately cut off the water supply from Israel to Gaza. 
Gallant added: ""We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.""
The defense minister's comments echo the sentiments of Ambassador Gilad Erdan, who represents Israel at the United Nations, condemning the ""savagery"" of Hamas' forces – kidnapping children and separating families.
""These are war crimes, blatant documented war crimes,"" he told reporters Sunday. ""The era of reasoning with these savages is over. Now is the time to obliterate Hamas terror infrastructure, to completely erase it, so that such horrors are never committed again.""

""Try to digest ruthless inhumanity seen images forever seared in my brain seeing blatant war crimes ... no words to describe such savagery,"" he added, waving graphic photos of Israeli residents.
""These animal-like terrorists gathered innocents into rooms .... as if stomping on insect(sic), among them who endured the Nazis, survived the holocaust were taken into Gaza,"" Erdan continued. 
And, ""This is Israel's 9/11 ... and Israel will do everything to bring our sons and daughters back home.""
He also called to ""obliterate Hamas terror infrastructure.""
Also on Monday, sirens could be heard ringing out in Jerusalem and across Israel. A large rocket barrage was also reported coming from the Gaza Strip into Israel, impacting Tel Aviv and other cities.

The war, which began early Saturday morning on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, has killed at least 1,100 people and left more than 2,000 wounded. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video on Saturday that Israel is ""at war"" and called for a massive military response.
On Saturday, Hamas led a massive operation that included thousands of Hamas and Islamic jihad militants using hang gliders and trucks to cross the Israeli border. 
The organized attack included the forces targeting five points at the border, before crossing into Israel. They then swarmed homes as people were sleeping inside.
They beheaded those inside or dragged occupants back across the border into the Gaza Strip, where they are being held hostage, Israeli officials said.
The militants indiscriminately killed Israeli soldiers, men, women and children, officials added. 
Hamas officials claim their forces have captured approximately 200 Israeli residents.

The major assault has also included Hamas militants firing approximately 1,500 rockets into Israel.
Hamas attacks on Israel have impacted cities near the Gaza Strip including Netiv Haasara, Kfar Aza, Nahal Oz, Sderot, Kibbutz Be'eri, Ofakim, Kissufim, Kerem Shalom and others.

"Rep Ilhan Omar walks back comments blaming Israel for Gaza hospital explosion, doesn’t offer apology",2023-10-19,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"FOX News host Kayleigh McEnany provides insight on misinformation peddled by 'Squad' members about the Israel-Hamas war on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'
Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., walked back her comments on social media blaming Israel for the explosion that occurred at a Gaza hospital but stopped short of offering an apology.
Many prominent progressives and members of the media rushed to believe Hamas' claims that an Israeli airstrike was responsible for an attack on the hospital where hundreds of civilians were reportedly killed.
However, both the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Biden administration have debunked the terrorist group's narrative, saying the explosion came from a misfired rocket from the Islamic Jihad — but not before it sparked international outcry with riots erupting in multiple countries.

""Our office cited an AP report yesterday that the IDF had hit a Baptist hospital in Gaza,"" Omar wrote Wednesday night. ""Since then, the IDF denied responsibility and the US intelligence assessment is that this was not done by Israel. It is a reminder that information is often unreliable and disputed in the fog of war (especially on Twitter where misinformation is rampant). We all have a responsibility to ensure information we are sharing is from credible sources and to acknowledge as new reports come in.""
She added, ""It is critical that we have a fully independent investigation to determine conclusively who is responsible for this war crime.""
'THE VIEW' CO-HOST CALLS OUT 'SQUAD' DEMOCRATS FOR ACCUSING ISRAEL OF ATTACK ON GAZA HOSPITAL: 'SHAME' ON THEM
Omar initially blasted Israel in reaction to a post from The Associated Press that read ""BREAKING: The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 500 people killed in an explosion at a hospital that it says was caused by an Israeli airstrike.""
""Bombing a hospital is among the gravest of war crimes. The IDF reportedly blowing up one of the few places the injured and wounded can seek medical treatment and shelter during a war is horrific,"" Omar wrote Tuesday. ""@POTUS needs to push for an immediate ceasefire to end this slaughter.""
Omar's post — which has not been taken down and has collected over 10 million views on X, formerly Twitter — was hit with Community Notes that read, ""President Joe Biden has confirmed that the explosion was most likely a result of the misfiring of a Hamas missile. Video also shows that the explosion was in a car park and does not appear to have demolished any buildings.""

Critics continued pummeling Omar's statement on social media.
""You’re still casting doubt on who bombed the hospital, taking Hamas’s line over the U.S. government’s facts that it was Islamic Jihad and not Israel,"" American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) reacted.
""Ilhan Omar shared Hamas propaganda for over a day, and then blamed @AP for it all. Shameless,"" Townhall.com writer John Hasson posted.
""The AP cited—not confirmed—Hamas…"" Washington Examiner reporter Julia Johnson pointed out.
""Ilhan Omar shared information that was completely false. It was a parking lot. It wasn't 500 casualties. It was a PIJ misfired missile. What chutzpah to now talk about only using ‘credible sources.’ She quoted Hamas terrorists! She has no business sitting in the US Congress,"" Jewish educator Joel M. Petlin wrote.

""THIS IS F---ING NOT GOOD ENOUGH,"" National Review contributor Pradheep J. Shanker told Omar. ""For 24 hours, you and your colleagues have repeated this lie. Even last night, it was clear that AT LEAST THE FACTS WERE IN DOUBT. You own the IDF an apology, frankly. And you owe the American people an apology. This is NOT AN APOLOGY.""
""This is as close to an apology as we're gonna get. Meaning it's not one,"" Media Research Center's Brittany Hughes said.
""Video and audio evidence, along with analysis of the impact site and intercepted communications, have told us exactly who is responsible. This does not remain a Whodunnit,"" conservative X personality Sunny McSunnyface wrote.
Omar's office cited her new statement and did not have any further comment when asked for comment by Fox News Digital. 
While Omar walked back her comments, her ""Squad"" colleague Rep. Rashida Tlaib., D-Mich., doubled down on her accusations against Israel at a pro-Palestinian protest even after President Biden had spoken out against the accusation.

DeSantis slammed over 1st Amendment concerns in banning pro-Palestine campus groups: ‘shameful’,2023-11-18,Fox News,['Brianna Herlihy'],"GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis weighs in on a March for Israel rally in the nation's capital and whether he believes there should be ideological screening of immigrants on ‘The Story.’
Ron DeSantis' move to shut down pro-Palestinian campus groups is receiving pushback both from civil libertarian groups and at least one 2024 presidential hopeful.
Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the Florida governor's administration arguing its demand for public universities to ""deactivate"" local Students for Justice in Palestine chapters is an attempt to ""stifle"" student speech protected by the First Amendment.
A spokesperson for the governor stood by DeSantis’ decision in light of the lawsuit, saying he was right ""to disband a group that provides material support to a terrorist organization."" 
But a DeSantis’ rival for the Oval Office, Vivek Ramaswamy, slammed the order as ""utter hypocrisy,"" while a libertarian-leaning group that fights for free speech on college campuses is also weighing in critically of the move.

""Free speech doesn’t just protect the ideas we love. It protects the ideas we hate,"" Ramaswamy told Fox News Digital in a statement. 
""The idiotic college ‘pro-Palestine’ student groups are dead wrong to excuse genocidal attacks against Jews and spout disgusting antisemitism, but one of the things that makes us different from Islamic terrorists is we don’t silence dissent,"" he said. 
On Oct. 24, Chancellor Ray Rodrigues of the state university system, in consultation with DeSantis, sent a memo to all state university presidents, noting that, after the deadly Hamas attacks that terrorists labeled Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (National SJP) released a ""toolkit"" that refers to Operation Al-Aqsa Flood as ""the resistance"" and said, ""Palestinian students in exile are PART of this movement, not in solidarity with this movement.""
Having identified at least two local SJP chapters active in Florida schools, Rodrigues ordered that, because of National SJP’s support of terrorism, those local chapters ""must be deactivated.""
FORMER ACLU PRESIDENT CAUTIONS THAT AMERICAN SELF-CENSORSHIP IS ERODING FREE SPEECH

The chancellor anchored his ""deactivation"" order for the student groups with Florida law, which makes it a felony to ""knowingly provide material support … to a designated foreign terrorist organization.""
""Here, National SJP has affirmatively identified it is part of the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, a terrorist-led attack,"" the chancellor said. 
The ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of an SJP chapter at the University of Florida (UF SJP), arguing the memo is ""an attempt to stifle"" students’ speech protected by the First Amendment and ""fosters an atmosphere of mutual suspicion.""
DESANTIS REJECTS DEMS' CLAIM HE'S ACTING MORE LIKE PRESIDENT THAN GOVERNOR AFTER WEAPONRY SHIPPED TO ISRAEL
""UF SJP is fully autonomous from both NSJP and other SJP chapters around the country. The Chancellor’s order provides no basis for attributing the speech of NSJP to Florida SJP chapters, including the UF SJP. Moreover, NSJP’s independent political advocacy — no matter its viewpoint — is fully protected by the First Amendment,"" the ACLU said in a press release. 
""The deactivation order is an attempt to stifle student groups’ pro-Palestine advocacy on campus at a time when the Palestine–Israel conflict is a matter of vital public discourse and concern."" 
Ramaswamy called the memo ""a shameful political ploy"" by DeSantis ""to ban the existence of pro-Palestinian student groups at Florida universities."" 
""It's unconstitutional. It’s utter hypocrisy for someone who railed against left-wing cancel culture,"" he said.

""Conservatives should be allowed to criticize BLM or vaccine mandates, and crazy liberals should be able to criticize Israel or the West even if they’re dead wrong about it. If government can censor who can speak vs. not, the rest of it really doesn’t matter: We’re no different than those we pretend to fight."" 
Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney for the free-speech advocacy nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), seems to agree, arguing ""advocacy alone"" does not amount to providing ""material support.""
""Public universities are bound by the First Amendment and cannot derecognize a student organization because of its protected expression,"" said Steinbaugh.

""Advocacy alone is not material support for terrorism and cannot be the basis to sanction students organizations."" 
FIRE issued a previous warning in October when the memo was issued, saying ""if it goes unchallenged, no one’s political beliefs will be safe from government suppression."" 
FIRE added there’s no indication from the letter that any action from Florida’s SJP groups ""went beyond expression fully protected by the First Amendment.""

Conor McGregor torches Ireland’s PM over response to Hamas release of child hostage,2023-11-26,Fox News,['Stephen Sorace'],"The IDF released video of Irish-Israeli citizen Emily Hand, 9, running up to her father and embracing him after spending 50 days as a hostage under Hamas.
Former UFC champion Conor McGregor ripped the prime minister of Ireland for ""downplaying"" the kidnapping and eventual release of an Irish-Israeli child by Hamas terrorists on Saturday.
McGregor called Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar a ""disgrace"" after he used the terms ""lost"" and ""found"" to describe the abduction and release of 9-year-old Emily Hand.
""She was abducted by an evil terrorist organization,"" the UFC superstar wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""What is with you and your government and your paid for media affiliates constantly down playing / attempting to repress horrific acts that happen to children. You are a disgrace.""
McGregor was referring to Hand, who was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from her friend, Hila’s, house in Kibbutz Be’eri in southern Israel on Oct. 7, along with Hila and Hila’s mother.

Varadkar had posted on social media after Emily Hand was reunited with her father, who initially believed she had been killed in the Hamas attack.
""This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family,"" the prime minister wrote. ""An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned, and we breathe a massive sigh of relief. Our prayers have been answered.""
BIDEN ADMIN ACCUSED OF AIDING PALESTINIAN ‘PAY FOR SLAY’ AS TERRORISTS PROFIT IN HAMAS DEAL, EXPERTS CLAIM
X flagged the prime minister’s post for context, writing, ""Emily Hand was kidnapped by Hamas Terrorists on October the 7th. The use of the term lost is inappropriate and fails to highlight that she was released as part of a hostage deal.""

Chicago college professor justifies Hamas attack ‘after 75 years of Israeli White supremacy’,2023-11-16,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks at the March for Israel rally.
A Chicagoland sociology professor sent a mass email to her students and department colleagues attempting to rally support for Palestinians who she claims have faced ""75 years of Israeli White supremacy.""
Brooke Johnson, an associate professor and sociology department coordinator at Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), argued ""As critical sociologists we are trained to analyze power and inequality in society"" and that ""this importantly comes with the responsibility to speak up when we witness harm, injustice, and violence,"" stressing ""What is currently happening in Palestine is one of those moments."" 
""After 75 years of Israeli White supremacy, including displacement, human rights violations, and systemic violence, Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th which resulted in 1400 deaths and 240 hostages,"" Johnson wrote in a Nov. 8 email obtained by Fox News Digital. ""Israel is now collectively punishing Palestinians. The Palestinian death toll from Israeli airstrikes exceeds 10,000, and almost half of these are children. This number increases daily as airstrikes continue; water, food and medical aid are cut off; and demands for a humanitarian cease-fire increase.""

One student who received the email was left ""really upset"" by what Johnson wrote, calling the accusations she made against Israel including being guilty of ""White supremacy"" as ""just not true.""
""I called my mom and I started crying,"" the student, who did not wish to be identified, told Fox News Digital. 
The student accused Johnson of ""justifying"" the Oct. 7 attack.
""She's saying like there was over 75 years- they had to deal with displacement and human rights. And then it commutes almost like after 75 years, they were like, 'we're done with it.' So I guess justifying it by saying they struggled for 75 years, and since they struggled, is acceptable to slaughter families and take them hostage,"" the student said.

Later in the email, after offering several articles she believes would educate her students and colleagues on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Johnson urged them to join the progressive cease-fire movement. 
""What can you do to get involved with demands for a humanitarian cease-fire?"" Johnson asked before listing several bullet points which include ""Talk with your Sociology professors about resistance movements, settler colonialism, antisemitism, racism, genocide, and sociology,"" contacting members of Congress, and signing petitions she shared. 
Johnson, who has a background in focusing on ""Women's, Gender, & Sexuality Studies,"" also shared a list from Haymarket Books of suggested books to read that includes titles like ""Palestine: A Socialist Introduction,"" ""Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions: The Global Struggle for Palestinian Rights,"" ""Apartheid Israel,"" ""Against Apartheid"" and ""The Palestine Communist Party."" 
Professor Johnson shared a list of suggested books which included titles like ""Palestine: A Socialist Introduction,"" ""BDS"" and ""Apartheid Israel."" (Haymarket Books)
Additionally, she urged students and colleagues to join protests and cited several resources to participate in upcoming demonstrations including a pro-Palestinian publication called ""The Electronic Intifada."" Historically, what’s called the First Intifada was a deadly series of attacks and protests carried out by Palestinians against Israelis during the 1980s. The Second Intifada occurred in the early 2000s as at least 1,000 Israelis were killed by terrorist attacks carried out by Palestinians using suicide bombers on buses and shooting civilians in the streets, bars and restaurants in cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
""I doubt that she meant to hurt people, but what she did really, really hurt me and honestly put a pretty negative idea of the school in my head,"" the student said.. ""I would say that before this email was sent, I enjoyed the school, I liked my teachers. I was pretty neutral. But now it really changes the way I look at the school, knowing that they hire people who will go and do this. It's pretty upsetting.""
Another NEIU sociology professor, Brett Stockdill ,similarly sent a mass email on behalf of ""NEIU Students, Staff, Faculty and Alumni for Justice in Palestine,"" urging students and staff in the department to sign an open letter calling for a cease-fire.

Though largely peaceful, the event ended with multiple arrests after a protester broke an American and a UN flag on a lamppost. (Stephen Yang for Fox News Digital)
The open letter sent by Stockdill, who according to his email uses ""he and they pronouns,"" briefly condemns the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas but kept much of the focus on ""the Israeli military's appalling siege and bombardment of Gaza."" 
""At a time of such staggering civilian casualties and destruction in Gaza, there is a simultaneous occurrence of unprecedented national and media-driven campaigns aimed at suppressing or stigmatizing voices that advocate for Palestinian human rights. In response, we urge our colleagues and administration to derive inspiration from the core values of Northeastern Illinois University,"" the open letter reads. ""We implore them to leverage their influence in supporting the national and international appeals for an immediate cease-fire and end to Israel's siege on Gaza. Furthermore, we encourage them to champion the protection of our students, staff, and faculty, enabling them to express their support for Palestinian human rights freely and without fear of censorship or intimidation.""
It also states ""We reject all claims that criticism of Israel is inherently anti-Semitic, and we stand with the many Jewish voices against this ongoing military occupation and killing of civilians."" However, the open letter makes no mention of the soaring instances of antisemitism across the country nor was there any mention of the roughly 240 hostages, up to nine of them Americans, being held captive in Gaza. 
Neither Johnson, Stockdill nor NEIU have immediately responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

White House silent on Biden official’s pro-Palestinian post amid bloodshed in Israel,2023-10-13,Fox News,['Thomas Catenacci'],"Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan discusses Hamas' unprecedented attacks in Israel on ""The Story.""
The White House opted not to respond to a request for comment after a Biden administration communications official's pro-Palestinian social media post resurfaced amid the Middle East crisis.
Tyler Cherry, who is now the Department of the Interior's principal deputy communications director and senior spokesperson, said in the 2014 post that he was celebrating the end of the ""occupation of Palestine."" The post came amid the 2014 Gaza War in which Palestinian forces, led by the radical Iran-backed terrorist group Hamas, launched hundreds of rockets into Israel, sparking a forceful Israeli response that involved airstrikes and a ground invasion.
""Cheersing in bars to ending the occupation of Palestine — no shame and f--- your glares #ISupportGaza #FreePalestine,"" Cherry said on July 25, 2014, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The White House, Interior Department and Cherry himself all ignored requests for comment about the post.
WHITE HOUSE SILENT AFTER BIDEN OFFICIAL'S POSTS ATTACKING POLICE, BOOSTING RUSSIA 'SCANDAL' RESURFACE
According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, an Israeli think tank, the 2014 war between Israel and the Palestinians — which began in early July 2014 and ceased in late August 2014 — began as a result of Palestinian militants' aggressive barrage of rocket attacks on Israel. An estimated 735 rockets fired from Gaza were ultimately intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome system.
The war started on July 8, 2014, when Israel launched Operation Protective Edge which was mainly focused on destroying — via airstrikes and, later, ground troops entering the Gaza Strip — an intricate network of tunnels the Hamas terrorist group used to cross into Israel underground, according to a report from the RAND Arroyo Center.

""While this was a war Israel did not want, it was a war that inadvertently preempted a terrorist massacre inside Israel’s heartland, principally through a network of sophisticated tunnels built deep under the border, and intended to stream hundreds, if not thousands, of dedicated terrorists, many on suicide missions, in the quiet of night, to destinations where they could kill as many innocent people as possible and leave Israel mauled as never before,"" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs stated in its own report.
Overall, according to the United Nations, 72 Israelis died during the war while there more than 2,000 Palestinian deaths, the vast majority of which occurred after the Palestinians rejected a ceasefire proposed by Israel on July 15, 2014.

While the United Nations and other global groups condemned Israel for the civilian deaths caused by its operations, now-retired U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey, who served as chairman of U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff between 2011 and 2015, said after the war that Israel had gone to ""extraordinary lengths to limit collateral damage and prevent civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict.""
BIDEN STANDS BY CLAIM CLIMATE CHANGE IS GREATEST THREAT AS HAMAS UNLEASHES TERROR ACROSS ISRAEL
Meanwhile, Cherry's post during the 2014 war resurfaced amid the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas. Last weekend, Hamas unleashed a series of coordinated attacks on innocent civilians across Israel, resulting in thousands of deaths.
Overall, the escalating conflict has claimed the lives of at least 2,500 people, including at least 1,000 Israelis and 27 Americans, according to the latest information.

""We have only started striking Hamas,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address this week. ""What we will do to our enemies in the coming days will reverberate with them for generations.""
Since Tuesday, Israeli warplanes have unleashed an aerial bombardment of downtown Gaza City, and the nation is considering sending its troops on the ground into Palestinian territories.

""The brutality of Hamas — this bloodthirstiness — brings to mind the worst — the worst rampages of ISIS. This is terrorism,"" Biden remarked in a speech on Tuesday. ""But sadly for the Jewish people, it’s not new.""
""Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond — indeed has a duty to respond — to these vicious attacks. I just got off the phone with — the third call with Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I told him if the United States experienced what Israel is experiencing, our response would be swift, decisive and overwhelming.""

"Israel declares war after Hamas surprise attack, launches retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza",2023-10-08,Fox News,['Stephen Sorace'],"Israels retaliatory blasts seen lighting up the sky in Gaza overnight (Reuters)
Israel's security cabinet officially declared war Saturday night after Hamas terrorists launched a surprise barrage of thousands of rockets into southern Israel, killing hundreds and wounding thousands, according to Israeli media.
Israeli soldiers battled Hamas fighters in the streets of southern Israel a day after Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists invaded the area and launched rockets from the Gaza Strip, killing at least 600 Israelis and wounding at least 2,000 others.
Israeli forces launched retaliatory strikes against Hamas terrorists in Gaza on Sunday, while also trading fire with Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in the north.
Israel struck 426 targets in Gaza, blasting residential buildings to the ground, including a 14-story tower that held dozens of apartments as well as Hamas offices in central Gaza City. Israeli forces fired a warning just before the strike.

The official said Palestinian leaders claimed that they don’t yet have a ""full picture"" of hostages, and those who were brought into Gaza were taken to ""secure locations"" across the territory.
Hamas terrorists claim to have taken enough Israeli hostages to free all the thousands of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israel on Sunday.
On Saturday night, Israel's security cabinet voted to officially go to war, unlocking ""significant military activities,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced, according to the Times of Israel. It is Israel's first declaration of war since the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Netanyahu had earlier declared war following the surprise attack on Israel, vowing that Hamas ""will pay an unprecedented price."" He warned, ""This war will take time. It will be difficult.""

October 23 | Israeli forces continue airstrikes on Hamas targets as invasion looms,2023-10-24,Fox News,[],"incoming update…
Coverage for this event has ended.


The Israel Defense Forces announced it has struck more than 400 terrorist targets in the past 24 hours, according to a post made on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. local time.
As part of its ""wide-scale operation"" to dismantle Hamas' capabilities, the IDF said the targets struck include: Hamas gunmen setting up to fire rockets in Israel's direction, an operational tunnel shaft allowing Israel to be infiltrated through the sea, and Hamas command centers and staging armaments in Mosques.
The focus continues to be on eliminating Hamas operatives and ""weapons storage sites, underground terrorist tunnels, command centers, observation posts and more,"" the IDF said in its daily recap.
The force also said it will continue operating with the safety of innocent civilians in mind.

Tuesday marked the 18th day of Israel's counteroffensive against Hamas since the terrorist group launched its unprecedented attack against the Jewish State on Oct. 7.

Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said Monday he has ""grave concerns"" about Israel's potential ground invasion into Gaza amid an ongoing war prompted by Hamas' terror attack on the Jewish State.
In a statement released Monday, Welch said he has ""grave concerns about the wisdom and military efficacy"" of an Israeli ground invasion in Gaza and that there is ""no doubt"" an imminent ground invasion would be ""catastrophic for innocent Palestinians in Gaza and jeopardize urgent efforts to save hostages.""
""Israel has the absolute right to attack Hamas for the brutal, heinous slaughter of more than 1,400 Israelis and the taking of more than 200 hostages,"" Welch wrote. ""But, Israel also has a responsibility to protect Palestinian civilians living in Gaza, including one million children. Already, more than 5,000 Palestinians have died.""

""The humanitarian conditions in Gaza are terrible and getting worse every day,"" Welch continued. ""One million Palestinians, including women and children, have been displaced. Most are living in the open—without food, without shelter, fuel, water, or access to medicine. United Nations relief efforts have begun but are unable to meet the extreme needs of the moment.""
The senator concluded, ""A ground invasion would further exacerbate the dire conditions in Gaza.""


Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said members of the far-left ""Squad"" of Democrats should be kept ""on the fringe where they belong"" and suggested their ""influence has waned and weakened"" because of extreme ideology related to the ongoing Israel-Gaza war.
Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., have irked supporters of Israel on both sides of the political aisle since Hamas’ devastating terror attacks on Oct. 7 that killed hundreds of civilians, including women, children and babies. Tlaib accused the Biden administration of funding a ""genocide"" against Palestinians and has spread the debunked claim that Israel bombed a Gaza hospital, Ocasio-Cortez has accused Israel of war crimes and Omar seemed to equate the Israeli victims killed by Hamas terrorists and Palestinians killed in the ongoing Israeli response.

""I think Rashida Tlaib has been so marginalized in her own district. And like, AOC, I don't even see her in the media anymore. I think these individuals with their radical ideas have marginalized themselves,"" Greenblatt told Fox News Digital.
Greenblatt was in Washington, D.C. last week and attended a meeting of Jewish communal leaders, the Jewish community and congressional leadership. He was pleased to see influential people from all sides standing with Israel, and believes the ""Squad"" should be disregarded on the topic.

""Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer and Steve Scalise and Mitch McConnell all said exactly the same thing. So, I just think AOC doesn't matter that much. She's one of 430-something people, or Tlaib or Ilhan Omar, and we don't need to assign them any more influence because already you see that their influence has waned and weakened in the last few years as their positions have become more radical, and they've reduced their ability, I think, to reach a wider audience,"" Greenblatt continued. ""There are extreme voices on all sides. Let's leave them on the fringe where they belong.""

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., is introducing a resolution on Tuesday to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., accusing the progressive ""Squad"" member of ""antisemitic activity"" and ""sympathizing with terrorist organizations.""
""The [Democratic] Party has done nothing to hold her accountable. They've done nothing to rein her in, and no one else here has done it. And so I thought it was right to list examples of – this isn't just new. This isn't a one-off thing. This is exactly who she is,"" Greene told Fox News Digital.

Greene accused Tlaib of leading a pro-Palestinian protest on Capitol Hill last week. Hundreds of demonstrators called for a cease-fire after the terror group Hamas staged an unprecedented, bloody incursion from the Palestinian exclave of Gaza into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing hundreds of civilians and prompting an ongoing response from the Israeli military.
Tlaib spoke at the protest, during which activists took over much of the ground floor at the Cannon House Office Building.
In those comments, she blamed Israel for bombing a hospital in Gaza – remarks she did not retract after multiple intelligence agencies said that existing proof indicated the blast came from a misfired Hamas rocket.
Greene called the protest ""an insurrection"" in her resolution.

Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Hamas has scaled back the airstrikes from Gaza in an effort ""to make us calm.""
""We observe a decrease in the launches from Gaza,"" Hagari said in a morning briefing. ""We call upon the public - stay alert. This is an attempt by the enemy to make us calm. Hamas still has launching capabilities from Gaza.""
More than 5,700 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel since Hamas terrorists launched their largest attack against Israel in decades on Oct. 7, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare war on the terrorist group. Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.

Israeli students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) say they are ""terrified"" to be on campus after participants at a campus protest chanted ""one solution, intifada, revolution"" at a rally supporting the devastating Hamas terrorist attacks that killed hundreds of Israelis in Israel.
MIT students Liyam Chitayat and Lior Alon told Fox News Digital in interviews that after they contacted MIT’s administration to report the calls to violence being chanted from the protest and for concern for their own safety, they’ve yet to receive a substantial response.

Chitayat, a 19-year-old pursuing a Ph.D. on a prestigious scholarship and who previously served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), describes the rally cry as a call for the murder of Jews and the demolition of Israel.
""Intifada is not a call for resistance. Intifada is the name of acts of bombing and killing civilians in Israel in the Israel-Palestine conflict. It's the name of taking civilian lives in terrorist attacks in Israel. That is what intifada means. That is how it's defined,"" she said.

The New York Times is being accused of ""modern-day blood libel"" by one of its former journalists after the Gray Lady botched its coverage of an explosion at a Gaza hospital by falsely attributing it to Israel.

Alison Leigh Cowan, a reporter and deputy business editor who spent 27 years at the Times, penned a scathing piece in Commentary magazine calling out her former employer for ""callously, and somewhat blithely committ[ing] at least two grave journalistic errors in relation to Israel and Gaza"" in the past week, telling readers ""its brazen self-assuredness and moral blindness in moments like these is breaking my heart.""

The first example she gave was the Times' rehiring of freelance videographer Soliman Hijjy, who was exposed last year of repeatedly praising Hitler on social media. The Times defended its decision to have Hijjy cover the current Israel-Hamas war telling Fox News Digital, ""We reviewed problematic social media posts by Mr. Hijjy when they first came to light in 2022 and took a variety of actions to ensure he understood our concerns and could adhere to our standards if he wished to do freelance work for us in the future. Mr. Hijjy followed those steps and has maintained high journalistic standards. He has delivered important and impartial work at great personal risk in Gaza during this conflict.""

Cowan knocked the Times' response, ""Translation: we need all hands on deck now, and if we had to pester people about everything they had posted online since they were ten or make them forswear Nazism and other noxious ideologies before we allowed them to help shape our news report, we might disappoint readers awaiting their daily fix of news. So, quit asking about how the sausage gets made, unless you want to see more recipes and word games filling out pages where there should be news.""
""'Journalistic ‘standards’ are good things, I agree, as are second chances for people who have seen the error of their ways. But this statement is evidence of an elementary lack of standards, not the re-imposition of them,"" she added.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tripled down on the Hamas narrative that Israel was behind last week's explosion at a Gaza hospital, something that had already been debunked by both Israeli and U.S. intelligence.
""Media outlets and third-party analysts have raised doubts about claims and evidence offered by both Israel and the Gaza Ministry of Health, and I agree with the United Nations that an independent investigation is necessary,"" Tlaib told Haaretz on Monday. ""I cannot uncritically accept Israel’s denials of responsibility as fact, especially in light of confirmation from the World Health Organization that Israel has bombed numerous medical facilities in Gaza and reports from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society of ongoing threats from the Israeli military to evacuate hospital.""

She continued, ""Both the Israeli and United States governments have long, documented histories of misleading the public about wars and war crimes - like last year’s Israeli military assassination of Shireen Abu Akleh and the false claims of weapons of mass destruction that led our country into the Iraq War - and cannot clear themselves of responsibility without an independent international investigation. This debate should not distract us from the urgent need for a ceasefire to save innocent civilian lives.""
Last week, Tlaib quickly condemned Israel after it was first reported that an Israeli airstrike killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians at a Gaza hospital.

""Israel just bombed the Baptist killing 500 Palestinians (doctors, children, patients) just like that,"" Tlaib wrote on X. ""@POTUS this is what happens when you refuse to facilitate a ceasefire & help de-escalate. Your war and destruction only approach has opened my eyes and many Palestinian Americans and Muslims Americans like me. We will remember where you stood.""
Initial reports were solely reliant on a statement from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. However, evidence emerged that the origin of the explosion was from a misfired rocket within Gaza aimed at Israel from Hamas ally Islamic Jihad.
It was also revealed that the explosion mostly occurred in the parking lot of the hospital and that the death toll is estimated to be a small fraction of what Hamas first alleged.

President Biden said Pope Francis is ""on the same page"" when it comes to the Israel-Hamas conflict, adding that the pontiff endorsed his ""game plan,"" according to reports.
Biden spoke about his conversation with the Pope during an event at the White House unrelated to the conflict, the New York Post reported.
""The pope and I are on the same page,"" Biden said. ""He was very, very interested in what we were doing to deal with some of the crises that we are facing, particularly in Israel this time around.""
Biden is only the second Catholic to hold the office of President in the U.S.
He said during the economy-focused event on Monday that he laid out what his game plan was with the middle east and how the U.S. “should be providing the kind of assistance to Israel that they needed.”
“And the pope was across the board supportive of what we’re doing,” he added.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin
 spoke with the Israeli defense minister over the phone on Monday, as the U.S. continues to lend support to Israel during its war with Hamas.
""Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant by phone today to receive updates on Israel's operations to restore security following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks,"" a press release from the Department of Defense read.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the U.S. would not hesitate to respond to attacks on American troops as they help the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
""What we’re seeing is a prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region,"" Blinken explained. ""We’re going to do what’s necessary to make sure that our troops are in that position and they were protected and that we have the ability to respond."" 
""We won't hesitate to take the appropriate action,"" he added.

Senior Pentagon officials predicted ""significant escalation"" of attacks against American troops in the Middle East during the Israel-Hamas war.
A senior defense official and a senior military official held a background briefing on Monday. Both officials referenced Iran as a malignant force.
""We see a prospect for much more significant escalation against U.S. forces and personnel in the near term,"" the defense official explained. ""And let’s be clear about it: the road leads back to Iran.""

The defense official also said that the Iranian government is currently equipping, funding and directing various Middle Eastern partners, including Lebanese Hezbollah militia groups.
""I think it’s fair to say when you see this uptick in activity in attacks by many of these groups, there’s Iranian fingerprints all over it,"" the defense official said.

A U.S. veteran non-profit organization is currently trying to rescue hundreds of trapped Americans in Israel.
The Special Operations Association of America (SOAA), which is based in Washington, D.C., has been working out of Tel Aviv to assist the stranded citizens. The SOAA is working to identify and reach the Americans who are still stranded amid the Israel-Hamas war.
The operations are being conducted by veteran volunteers working around the clock six days a week. Some of them only get one or two hours of sleep per night.

""We’re in contact with those American citizens trapped in Gaza and providing updates to official channels, keeping them calm, and staying prepared to move them to safety based on intelligence,"" Executive Director of SOAA David Cook said.
""With Hamas currently in control of Gaza it is incredibly dangerous to evacuate trapped Americans,"" Cook added. ""We’re working with local authorities and the State Department to make sure Americans reach safety, but to do this without risk of innocent life we are favoring a slightly slower, but more deliberate and safe response.""

Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and Nurit Cooper, 79, were released by Hamas terrorists on October 23.

Two Israeli hostages named Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and Nurit Cooper, 79, were released by Hamas terrorists on Monday, officials say.
The two women were kidnapped from their houses in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. Both of the women's husbands are still being held as hostages - Amiram Cooper, 85, and Oded Lifshitz, 83.
According to a statement released by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Office, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acted ""in all channels"" to ""overcome the many obstacles Hamas has laid"" and secure the women's release.

""After they were transferred to the hands of the IDF, they are making their way to a medical center in Israel who is prepared for them and where their family members await them,"" the statement read. ""We thank Egypt for the assistance and the Red Cross for their important role as life savers.""
""The government of Israel, IDF and the security establishment, will continue to act to the best of their abilities to trace all missing and return all hostages back home,"" Netanyahu's press release added.

President Biden said that the U.S. ""can talk"" about a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas once hostages are released from Gaza, as the war between Israel and Hamas terrorists goes on.
After Biden walked away from the podium following a Monday press conference, a reporter shouted ""Is the U.S. supporting a hostages for a ceasefire deal?""
""We should have a ceasefire...not a ceasefire - we should have those hostages released and then we can talk,"" Biden replied.
At least 200 people were taken hostage by Hamas terrorists and forcibly brought into Gaza since October 7. Biden, along with European leaders like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, has called for the urgent release of all hostages.
""The leaders reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians,"" a joint statement from the leaders read. The statement, which was released on Sunday, also requested the ""immediate release of all remaining hostages.""


An Israeli source has confirmed to Fox News that two Israeli hostages have been released from Gaza, as the war between Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) continues.
The hostages were reportedly released after Qatari mediation efforts, according to an additional source.

More than 1400 Israelis have been killed since the war began on October 7, with at least 200 hostages taken into Gaza by Hamas fighters.
Palestinian authorities estimate that over 5,000 of their citizens have been killed so far, with nearly 16,000 injured.

Israel names 5 top Hamas commanders eliminated since October 7 assault

Israel says it has killed five commanders of a key Hamas military group in the 17 days since the war broke out in the region.
The IDF says each of the commanders was a member of the Hamas Aerial Array, which operates a variety of weapons against the State of Israel and played a significant role in the October 7 massacre.
Israel identified the commanders as Murad Abu Murad, Commander of the Hamas Aerial Array in Gaza City; Moed' Abdel Rahman, Head of Hamas Training Portfolio in Gaza City; Othman Hamdan, Aerial Defense Officer of Hamas’ Zabra Tel Elhua Battalion; Machud El Rifi, Hamas Weapons Supply Manager in Gaza City, and Essan Shalouf, Head of Training for the Hamas Aerial Defense Array in northern Gaza.
Israel has so far restricted itself to launching airstrikes against Hamas installations in Gaza, but the military appears poised for a ground assault as well. Military experts say such an operation is the only way to ensure the destruction of Hamas, which is Israel's stated goal.

Gov. Larry Hogan cuts ties with Harvard over 'dangerous anti-Semitism'


Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has withdrawn his offer to participate in fellowships at Harvard this fall, citing ""dangerous anti-Semitism"" that has spread across the campus.
Hogan, a Republican, made the announcement Monday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The move comes after dozens of Harvard student organizations and staff blamed Israel for the October 7 Hamas attack that left at least 1,400 people murdered.
""This morning, I informed Harvard that I must withdraw my offer to participate in fellowships this Fall. I cannot condone the dangerous anti-Semitism that has taken root on their campus,"" Hogan wrote.


Harvard University has been the center of controversy ever since the Hamas attack on Israel, with pro-Palestinian student groups releasing a joint statement claiming Israel was ""entirely responsible"" for Hamas’ attack. It said, ""Today's events did not occur in a vacuum. For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison.""

Conflict between Israel and Hezbollah continues to escalate this week as Israel began hitting Hezbollah targets deeper in Lebanon.
Israeli forces
 have warned Hezbollah not to join Hamas' war against Israel, vowing to destroy the terrorist organization if it does. The Iran-backed group has continued to fire missiles into Northern Israel since Hamas' October 7 assault.
Israel would be faced with a true two-front war should the conflcit escalate, with Hamas to the south and Hezbollah to the north.
The U.S. has joined Israel in threatening both Iran and Hezbollah with retaliation should they intervene. The U.S. has stationed two aircraft carrier strike groups in the Eastern Mediterranean to assist Israel should it need them.

New York Times admits it relied 'too heavily' on Hamas claims in report on Gaza hospital explosion

The New York Times admitted on Monday that ""editors should have taken more care with the initial presentation"" of the explosion that occurred at a Gaza hospital last week after the paper ""relied too heavily on claims by Hamas.""
Much of the legacy media has egg on its face for allowing the Hamas-backed Gaza Health Ministry to set the initial framing of the story, as Hamas’ claim that Israel was at fault was widely parroted. The Israel Defense Forces determined the blast was caused by a rocket misfire launched by Islamic Jihad, another terrorist organization active in Gaza. President Biden, based on evidence from the IDF and U.S. intelligence, has publicly said Israel was not to blame. 
The New York Times published a lengthy editor’s note on Monday explaining its mistakes.

US base in Syria fends off drone attack as tensions rise

Two U.S. defense officials confirmed to Fox News a base housing U.S. troops in Syria was attacked by drones Monday morning.
The officials say no injuries have been reported. Iran-backed militias in Iraq claimed they were responsible for the attack, which took place in southeastern Syria. The attack is at least the fourth time a U.S. base has come under drone attack in the Middle East since Hamas launched its assault on Israel on October 7. A U.S. base in Iraq was also struck last week.
The U.S. currently has about 900 U.S. forces in Syria and 2,500 troops in Iraq, U.S. officials confirmed to Fox News.
U.S. forces in the region remain on high alert amid Israel's war against Hamas. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has set aside 2,000 U.S. troops to be prepared to intervene in the conflict if necessary.

How Pro-Palestinians are using ‘Algospeak’ to dodge social media scrutiny and disseminate hate

Have you ever seen a post on social media that uses emojis, asterisks or code words to talk about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?
 If so, you might have encountered what some activists call ""Algospeak"" – a secret language that helps them evade social media policies and algorithms.
""Algospeak"" is a term recently coined to describe strategically modified language to evade algorithmic detection. At its core, ""Algospeak"" involves altering language with a collection of phrases, special spellings and code words that pro-Palestinian activists use to prevent their posts from being removed or suppressed by social media companies.
For example, they might use ""terrier"" instead of ""terrorist,"" ""P*les+in1ans"" instead of ""Palestinians,"" or ""violin"" instead of ""violence.""

An IDF soldier joined Fox News to describe scnes of carnage he witnessed in Southern Israel following the October 7 attack by Hamas on Monday.
The IDF special forces member, who spoke with Fox under the name ""Nimrod"" says he saw scores of bodies in the streets, with many of the women having been raped.
He described one incident in which a group of Israelis were hding in a bomb shelter. Hamas militants soon found them, and the terrorists pulled one woman out, saying she would be set aside for rape. The terrorists then threw two grenades insde the shelter, ""killing everyone.""
Israel is now poised for a ground invasion fo the Gaza Strip, though no timeline has been offered.


Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst led a Fox News crew to an Israeli village that had been brutalized in Hamas' October 7 attack on Monday.

Footage from the scene shows bloodstained floors, bullet holes and broken shelter doors--evidence of Hamas' crimes during its surprise attack 17 days ago. Yingst says residents of some of the homes were executed at point blank range by Hamas terrorists, while others were burned.


The Israeli government shared footage of Hamas' October 7 terror attack with roughly 100 journalists on Monday, prompting horrific descriptions on social media.

Israel has chosen not to release the footage publicly out of respect for the families of the victims, but journalists described horrific scenes of brutality and violence. Footage reportedly showed Hamas terrorists murder a father in front of his two sons in one instance. Another showed a militant bragging to his mother about having killed 10 Jews, having called her on the phone of a dead victim.


Israel's release of footage comes as its military is poised for a ground invasion of Gaza. Israeli Defense Forces have remained mustered on the Gaza border for more than a week.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to ""destroy"" Hamas, but has offered no timeline for when an invasion might begin.

Son of Hamas founder says mainstream media 'afraid' to label group a genocidal religious movement

The son of a Hamas founder
 said Hamas is even more dangerous than ISIS on Monday, claiming the mainstream media is afraid to call it a genocidal religious movement for fear of igniting a full-on religious war.
""It's their own comparison to say Hamas and ISIS because I think Hamas is a lot more dangerous,"" Mosab Hassan Yousef told ""FOX & Friends.""
""Look at the division and the global confusion because of Hamas. They brought us to our knees somehow by their brutality and their barbarism. Brutality is even understating Hamas' acts. Hamas is a religious movement, and they are a raging religious movement against Israel. The mainstream media cannot say this, because they are afraid to ignite a religious war. And what I say, it already is. They want to annihilate the Jewish people because they are Jewish people, because they are a Jewish state.""

Yousef, who renounced the terrorist group and became an informant for Israel's internal security service Shin Bet in the 1990s, said Hamas couldn't be negotiated with since it wasn't a national or political movement.

AOC accuses Israel of war crimes: Hamas committed 'horrific' attacks, 'however...'

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. insisted that she was not defending Hamas as she accused Israel of committing war crimes on Sunday.
Ocasio-Cortez appeared on MSNBC’s ""The Mehdi Hasan Show"" to defend her position of calling for a ceasefire following Hamas’ attack against Israel on Oct. 7. When asked whether Israel had a right to defend itself, she argued that ""war crimes"" are not the appropriate response.

She began, ""I think one of the things that’s important to recognize about this situation is the asymmetry of what is going on as well as the collective punishment of what is happening to the Palestinian people at this moment. Hamas has absolutely engaged in horrific attacks. Every single day there are more details that are released about what occurred on October 7th that shocks the human consciousness and shocks our conscience, our collective conscience.""
""However we do know as well that war crimes do not constitute and are not an appropriate response for other war crimes,"" Ocasio-Cortez explained.
""It is inacceptable to think that 1700 Palestinian children alone, their deaths will somehow make up or justify the violence of what we saw on October 7th.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
 issued an open warning against Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, which operates in Lebanon, discouraging them from invading Israel as his country is widely expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza. The expected ground invasion follows Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities.
While visiting troops in northern Israel on Sunday, Netanyahu said if Hezbollah were to launch a war and invade Israel, ""it will make the mistake of its life. We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state will be devastating.""
Hezbollah, which is armed with tens of thousands of rockets, has teased aggressions with Israel, even firing anti-tank missiles into northern Israel and targeting military outposts. Israel has evacuated thousands of civilians near the northern border as a precaution.

More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed. The total mostly consists of civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack. At least 222 people have been captured and dragged back to Gaza, including foreigners, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Israel has no other option than to fully eliminate Hamas and its influence in Gaza, an Israeli consulate officials said Monday.
The official, Itay Milner, appeared on Fox News on Monday to discuss Israel's ongoing war against Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
 has vowed to ""destroy"" Hamas, calling them ""bloody monsters"" following their October 7 attack on Israel.
Milner went on to say that a potential conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to the north would be far more severe than the ongoing war. Hezbollah, an Iran-back terrorist group, has far greater access to support than Hamas and is much more powerful.
""We are preparing for any scenario, and I can assure you that if they do try to start a war with Israel that, as the prime minister said, that would be the biggest mistake that they've ever done,"" Milner said.


President Biden's administration urged Israel to delay its ground invasion of the Gaza Strip followi Hamas' unprecedented October 7 assault.

Administration officials say they recommended the delay in hopes to buy time for further hostage negotiations, according to the New York Times.
The officials reportedly said no ultimatums were made, however, and the U.S. would still fully support Israel if it were to move forward with a ground invasion.
Israel's military has been positioned for a ground invasion of Gaza for more than a week, unleashing an onslaught of airstrikes on Hamas positions.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has predicted that any invasion of Gaza would be defined by slow movement, IEDs, and booby-traps as Hamas terrorists have had ample time to prepare for an invasion.

Blinken warns US 'won't hesitate' to get involved in Israel-Hamas war if line is crossed


The United States is poised to get involved in the Israel-Hamas war should the conflict escalate into regional forces intentionally targeting American personnel, senior officials said.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Sunday that the U.S. expects Iranian proxies to seek opportunities to escalate the Israel-Hamas war and asserted that the Biden administration is prepared to respond accordingly if American civilians or armed forces become targets.
""This is not what we want, not what we're looking for. We don't want escalation,"" Blinken said. ""We don't want to see our forces or our personnel come under fire. But if that happens, we're ready for it.""

Austin added: ""What we’re seeing is a prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region. We’re going to do what’s necessary to make sure that our troops are in that position and they were protected and that we have the ability to respond."" He affirmed that the U.S. has the right to defend itself and said, ""We won't hesitate to take the appropriate action.""
Austin also said the U.S. would continue to increase its presence in the region to ""send another message to those who would seek to widen this conflict.""

Pro-Hamas protests have European politicians worried as US watches closely


Pro-Hamas protests popping up in the streets of Europe and in certain U.S. cities are sparking new debates over what critics have called misguided multiculturalism, failed integration, underfunded police forces and unchecked immigration.
Outbreaks of alleged antisemitism targeting Israel unfolded among some pro-Palestinian protesters in London and in Brooklyn, New York, on Saturday as demonstrators chanted the controversial slogan ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.""
An estimated 100,000 demonstrators turned out in London to align themselves with the Palestinian cause - a section of some seemingly in favor of Hamas, whose stated aims are to eradicate Israel and murder Jews.
U.K. Home Secretary Suella Braverman termed the slogan ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" as antisemitic, noting that the language is ""widely understood to call for the destruction of Israel."" Braverman’s governmental office is comparable to the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security.
Robert Jenrick, the U.K. immigration minister, took pro-Palestinians to task for chanting ""jihad"" on the streets of the British capital. He said they are ""inciting terrorist violence"" by invoking the oft-cited battle cry by radical Islamists.

Israeli speaks out after brother-in-law killed by Hamas: 'Don't think the media is doing a good job'

Israeli Idan Rakovsky spoke to Fox News Digital after his brother-in-law, Avidan Tordjman, was killed by Hamas members in the infamous October 7 attacks. He criticized international media — both left-wing and right-wing — for its treatment of the Israel-Hamas war.

""How would the average American, or Canadian, or British, or French — doesn't matter now — How would he or she respond to [an event] 20 times 9/11 in one day?"" Rakovsky said of the October 7 attacks by Hamas that left at least 1,400 Israelis killed, with at least 199 others being taken hostage by Hamas into Gaza.
""That's what we're going through right now,"" Rakovsky said, again comparing the shock and tragedy of the Hamas attacks on Israelis and other citizens at a festival on the Gaza-Israel border to 9/11. ""So seeing the coverage outside of Israel is very, very hard,"" he said.
""I can tell you that we are already used to it, unfortunately,"" he said. ""So it doesn't really bother us anymore. We know that Israel is strong for itself and that we have no one to rely on [but] ourselves. And that's that's fine with us. And that's why we need to be as strong as we can."" 

Rakovsky responded directly to the media coverage of the Gaza hospital bombing, which has sparked intense debate online as outlets, including CBS and The New York Times, received criticism for suggesting that Israel was to blame.

The Jewish vote may swing Republican in 2024 as Israel war continues, experts say

Jewish-Americans may be more likely to vote for Republican candidates in 2024 as stances from some Democratic canddiates on the Israel-Hamas war push them away.
Division 
among Democrats over the war is likely to have a meaningful effect on the presidential race down to local congressional races, insiders and several Jewish voters told Fox News Digital.
Multiple House Democrats – including Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and other members of the far-left ""Squad"" – have taken aim at President Biden and Democrat leadership over their support for Israel.

""I have not seen this kind of a shift – at least a discussed shift, obviously no one's voted yet – since 1980,"" Jake Novak, the former media director at the Israeli Consulate in New York, told Fox News Digital. ""In 1980, Jimmy Carter still won a majority of the Jewish vote, but it was way down from '76. There were a lot of Jewish voters who were disappointed in him.""
Sixty-four percent of Jewish voters in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center, identify as Democrats or left-leaning while 26% consider themselves Republicans or right-leaning. Another 9% do not lean left or right, the think tank's data shows.
Despite the gap in support for Democrats over Republicans from Jewish Americans, Novak, a political analyst, said he expects there to be ""significant change"" in how the demographic votes next year.

Netanyahu delivers deadly warning to Hezbollah as Israel prepares for Gaza invasion

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued an open warning to the Iran-backed terrorists of Hezbollah on Monday, discouraging them from invading Israel from the north as his country is widely expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza.

The expected ground invasion follows Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities. While visiting troops in northern Israel on Sunday, Netanyahu said if Hezbollah were to launch a war and invade Israel from Lebanon, ""it will make the mistake of its life. We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state will be devastating.""
Hezbollah, which is armed with tens of thousands of rockets, has teased aggressions with Israel, even firing anti-tank missiles into northern Israel and targeting military outposts. Israel has evacuated thousands of civilians near the northern border as a precaution.
More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed. The total mostly consists of civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack. At least 222 people have been captured and dragged back to Gaza, including foreigners, according to Fox News' Yael Kuriel.

Israeli forces struck 320 Hamas military targets over 24-hour period: IDF


The Israeli Defense Forces and Israeli Securities Authority announced that Israeli forces have struck more than 320 Hamas military targets in the Gaza Strip within the past day.
""Over the past day, the IDF continued to strike terror infrastructure and military targets in the Gaza Strip,"" the IDF and ISA said in a statement. ""Following ISA and IDF intelligence, the terror targets struck included tunnels containing Hamas terrorists, dozens of operational command centers, some of which concealed Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists, military compounds, and observation posts.""
""Furthermore, the IDF struck targets that posed a threat to forces in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip who are preparing for ground operations, including dozens of mortar shell and anti-tank missile launch posts,"" the statement continued. ""Overnight, an IDF tank thwarted a number of terrorist cells, including an anti-tank missile cell.""

Since Hamas launched its Oct. 7 attack, more than 5,700 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel and thousands more have been wounded.
As of Monday morning, the number of people taken hostage by Hamas has reached 222.

White House battles reporters as it rejects Hamas’ Gaza death count: We won’t cite a ‘terrorist organization’,2023-10-26,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the National Security Council John Kirby takes questions on Hamas claims and the White House’s communications with Israeli counterparts.
Top White House official John Kirby clashed with several reporters over President Biden's rejection of the Hamas-provided death toll of Palestinians in Gaza since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks against Israel. 
Questions at Thursday's press briefing were dominated by the comments Biden made Wednesday. He said he had ""no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth"" about the civilian body count being provided by the Gaza Ministry of Health, which is run by Hamas, saying, ""I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.""
""The president yesterday, John, said he has no confidence in the death toll numbers presented by the Palestinians in Gaza. What's he basing that on? How did he reach that conclusion?"" Reuters correspondent Steve Holland asked the NSC spokesman. 
""Well, we all know that the Gaza Ministry of Health is just a front for Hamas, it's run by Hamas, a terrorist organization,"" Kirby responded. ""I've said it myself up here, we can't take anything coming out of Hamas, including the so-called Ministry of Health, at face value.""
BIDEN REFUTES PBS REPORTER'S QUESTION ON HAMAS-PROVIDED GAZA DEATH COUNT: ‘I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE’ IT'S TRUTHFUL

NBC correspondent Peter Alexander pressed Kirby, ""You don't dispute that thousands of Palestinians, many of them innocent civilians, have been killed by Israeli strikes so far, do you?"" Kirby replied, ""Of course not,"" but reiterated that the numbers provided by Hamas' Ministry of Health should not be relied on.
""They say it's more than 7,000. Is there any way to assess how many it is?"" Alexander followed. ""I mean, the president said — it was a pretty dramatic moment when he said, yeah, we don't have any confidence in that. We respect you can't take Hamas at its word, but it does appear by all independent journalism, including that by a lot of people in the room, that thousands of Palestinians has been killed. Would you agree?""
""We would not dispute that,"" Kirby answered.
CNN ISSUES CORRECTION AFTER PUSHING HAMAS NARRATIVE: WE ‘DID NOT CLEARLY ATTRIBUTE CLAIMS’ TO TERROR GROUP
Another reporter, McClatchy correspondent Michael Wilner, asked whether the Biden administration had any idea what percentage of the deaths in Gaza have been Hamas terrorists versus civilians, something Kirby replied, ""I do not.""
Things got more combative when NPR correspondent Franco Ordoñez pointed out how several aid groups including the United Nations have cited those numbers, asking, ""Are they wrong to do that?""
""They can make their own decisions about what numbers they want to say. We're not going to cite 'em,"" Kirby responded.

Raquel Krähenbühl of Brazil's TV Globo then interjected, pointing out how the State Department had previously cited Hamas' numbers in the past, prompting Ordoñez to ask, ""Is the administration's position that is now — Hamas is now manipulating the numbers now, but not before?"" 
""Well, do you remember that attack on the hospital?"" Kirby shot back. ""And what did the Gaza Ministry of Health put out, something like 500? They slapped the number 500 on it — you know — within the hour of that attack and, of course, they — the same Ministry of Health said it was an Israeli airstrike. So, we know that's not true. And we've now since found out that the numbers aren't that high, either. They never got up to 500."" 
Kirby continued, ""Now it was — it was at least a couple of hundred. That's terrible, and that's atrocious and that's sad. And we all obviously grieve with the families and loved ones who are affected by that, but the numbers are not reliable. They're just not reliable, and I don't need to tell you how to do your jobs, but if you're going to report casualty figures out of Gaza, I would frankly recommend you don't choose numbers put out by an organization that's run by a terrorist organization.""

Krähenbühl later grilled Kirby on Biden's remarks when he said, ""I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war.""
""Don't you think this is insensitive?"" Krähenbühl asked. ""There’s being very harsh criticism about it. For example, the Council of American-Islamic Relations said it was deeply disturbed and called on the president to apologize. Would the president apologize? And does he regret saying something like that?""
""No, no,"" Kirby told the reporter. ""What’s harsh is the way Hamas is using people as human shields. What’s harsh is taking a couple of hundred hostages and leaving families anxious waiting and worrying to figure out where their loved ones are. What's harsh is dropping in on a music festival and slaughtering a bunch of young people just trying to enjoy an afternoon. I could go on and on. That's what's harsh. That is what's harsh.""

""And being honest about the fact that there have been civilian casualties and that there likely will be more is being honest, because that's what war is. It's brutal. It's ugly. It's messy. I've said that before. The president also said that yesterday. Doesn't mean we have to like it, and it doesn't mean that we're dismissing any one of those casualties — each and every one is a tragedy in its own right... It would be helpful if Hamas would let them leave... We know that there are thousands waiting to leave Gaza writ large and Hamas is preventing them from doing it. That is what is harsh,"" he added. 
Last week, several news organizations rushed to report claims made by the Gaza Health Ministry that Israel bombed Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital through an airstrike resulting in more than 500 civilian casualties. 
Subsequent reporting and intelligence found it was an explosion in the hospital's parking lot stemming from a misfired rocket fired by Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, resulting in a death toll a fraction of what Hamas had first alleged.

"Biden delivers Oval Office speech addressing support for Israel, Ukraine in their wars | Live Updates from Fox News Digital",2023-10-20,Fox News,[],"incoming update…
Coverage for this event has ended.
The Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq, which hosts U.S. and international forces, was targeted by drones and rockets Thursday evening, according to Reuters.
Two security sources told the outlet ""multiple blasts"" were heard inside the base and it was not immediately clear if the attacks caused casualties or damages. The area around the base was closed by the Iraqi military, who began a search operation.
Rockets hit another military base hosting U.S. forces near Baghdad's international airport, a U.S. defense official confirmed to Fox News.

“We can confirm a rocket attack on U.S. and Coalition forces at the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center, near the Baghdad International Airport, occurred Friday at approximately 2:50 am local. Initial assessments indicate two rockets were fired,"" the official said. ""One was intercepted by a counter-rocket system and the other impacted an empty storage facility. There were no casualties reported. We will provide additional information as it becomes available.”
The attack took place at 7:50 p.m. ET, approximately 10 minutes before President Biden delivered a prime-time address from the Oval Office.

The Thursday attacks mark four in the past 24 hours targeting Iraqi military bases that host U.S. forces. Two separate drone attacks took place on Wednesday with one causing minor injuries to a small number of troops, according to Reuters. The U.S military was able to intercept the armed drone.


Reuters and Fox News' Liz Friden contributed to this report.
Al-Naba, a weekly magazine put together by ISIS,
 called for the targeting of Jews across the world in its edition published Friday.
Issue 413 features what the publication describes as an infographic titled “Practical ways to support Muslims in Palestine,” which encourages attacks on Jewish people and Israel in efforts to ""return its land to the House of Islam again."" 
Translated from Arabic to English, the page says the first step of support is through “military victory” with the overall objective of attacking Jewish people in America, Europe and across the world in their neighborhoods, synagogues, and nightclubs. It also encourages attacks with fire and vandalism on embassies belonging to Israel and its allies.
The page describes the second step of support as educating generations that “the battle with the Jews” is not patriotic or nationalistic, but “purely religious and ideological,” adding that the “battlefield” includes all places where Jewish people are present.

The third step is “support through supplication,” which describes prayer as a “deadly weapon if conditions and etiquette are met.”
Since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, security has increased in major American cities and countries around the globe as law enforcement works to prevent acts of antisemitism and violence against Jews.




Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, is accusing President Biden of using Israel's fight against Hamas terrorists to push additional aid to Ukraine in its ongoing battle with Russia, describing the effort in the president's prime-time address from the Oval Office Thursday night as ""completely disgraceful.""
During Biden's address, which focused primarily on the conflicts in both countries, he said he would be sending Congress an ""urgent budget request"" on Friday to fund America's national security needs, which includes supporting critical partners like Israel and Ukraine.

Vance responded to the president's push for funding in both countries in real time on X, formerly Twitter, and called his efforts ""disgusting.""
""What Biden is doing is disgusting. He’s using dead children in Israel to sell his disastrous Ukraine policy to skeptical Americans. They are not the same countries, they are not the same problems, and this effort to use Israel for political cover is offensive. Hell no,"" the senator wrote.


Vance joined Sean Hannity as a guest Thursday night to further explain his thoughts, where he added that it's ""completely disgraceful"" that Biden is trying to sell Americans on a ""Ukrainian escalation"" while addressing Israel's fight against Hamas since the terrorist group launched its attack on the Jewish state on Oct. 7.

""If he wants to sell the American people on $60 billion more to Ukraine, he shouldn't use dead Israeli children to do it. It was disgusting,"" Vance said, reiterating that ""it is a separate country and a separate problem.""


Israel will evacuate residents in the city of Kiryat Shmona, which is near Lebanon, as the Israel Defense Forces announce increased activity at the northern border.
Israel's Ministry of Defense and the IDF said the city's residents will be evacuated to state-funded guest houses following a plan approved by Defense Minister Yoav Galant.

""A short while ago, the Northern Command informed the mayor of the city of the decision. The plan will be managed by the local authority, the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Defense,"" the MoD said on X, formerly Twitter.
The IDF gave a summary Thursday of recent activity at the Lebanese border which included: nine launches crossed from Lebanon into Israel, four interceptions by the IDF Aerial Defense Array and several anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon toward Israel.
The force said it responded by ""returning fire to the origin of the strikes, thwarting a terrorist cell using an IDF unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and striking Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure using tank fire.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged the challenges faced by his staff since Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel in a long letter sent to his team Thursday night, which was obtained by Fox News' James Levinson.
Blinken, who returned from a trip to the region on Wednesday after arriving in Israel on Oct. 12, praised his staff for their work ""under tremendous pressure"" after giving a rundown of the trip's objectives then went on to discuss the personal impact of the conflict.
""I know that, for many of you, this time has not only been challenging professionally, but personally. Some of our colleagues in the region, especially among our locally employed staff, have been directly affected by the violence, including by losing loved ones and friends,"" he wrote.

He continued: ""Others have felt the ripples of fear and bigotry fueled by the conflict -- including in the United States, where mounting acts of hatred against Arab Americans, Muslims and Jews are making people feel vulnerable in their own communities, simply because of who they are or what they believe.""


Blinken also wrote that the loss of innocent lives and the images produced from the Israel-Hamas war are ""wrenching"" and impact everyone, even those without direct ties to the conflict. He added that he mourns the loss of all innocent lives, Israeli and Palestinian, and he will not give up on the vision of both groups living with ""equal measures of security, freedom, justice, opportunity, and dignity.""
He went on to encourage his team to ""devote extra care and attention to each other"" and reminded them additional support is available if needed.

The letter concluded with: ""We have a difficult stretch ahead. The risk of greater turmoil and strife is real. And yet, where this crisis goes from here is not inevitable. It will come down, in no small part, to how America -- and each and every one of us -- leads in this critical period.
""So for all you have already done -- and all that you will do as we navigate this crisis -- thank you.
""I'm proud as ever to be on your team.""

EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is facing a demand for her removal from future classified briefings on military operations in Israel after she sided with Hamas over the Biden administration concerning the explosion at a Gaza hospital earlier this week.
In a Thursday letter obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital, Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, accused the far-left ""Squad"" member of spreading ""misinformation"" when she repeated Hamas' claim Israel was behind the hospital explosion. U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials have repeatedly said it was caused by a rocket fired from Gaza.

Jackson also accused her of being a Hamas sympathizer.
""I demand that Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib be prevented from participating in any classified briefing about Israel's ongoing military operations, Israel's self-defense efforts, or any American military movements in and around the region,"" Jackson wrote to Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.
""We must not allow Hamas sympathizers in this body to serve as the mouthpiece for Palestinian terrorists. Rather than condemn the attacks by Hamas, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has chosen to side with Hamas by spreading misinformation,"" he wrote.

Jackson went on to write it had ""become clear that Congresswoman Tlaib's allegiance lies with Hamas,"" and that she couldn't be trusted with sensitive information that could ""put American and Israeli lives at risk.""
""I demand that her security clearance be revoked immediately and that she be prevented from participating in any relevant briefings,"" he added.
In a statement to Fox, Jackson vowed to do everything in his power as a member of the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees. He said Tlaib and her fellow ""Squad"" members should not view American intelligence on the situation in Israel.
""I don't know what's more concerning, that we have Members of Congress who are antisemites and support Hamas, or that we let those Members of Congress attend classified briefings on the war in Israel,"" he said.
""You do not let the enemy know your plans, and letting Representative Tlaib into these briefings is doing exactly that. Furthermore, this anti-American, anti-Jewish sentiment from elected ‘leaders’ must STOP, it is dangerous!"" he added.
Fox has reached out to Tlaib's office for comment.

President Biden
 will request funding from Congress for Israel and Ukraine in order to ""fund America’s national security needs"" – an investment he said will ""pay dividends for American security,"" while warning that both Hamas and Russian President Vladimir Putin seek to ""completely annihilate a neighboring democracy.""
The president addressed the nation from the Oval Office Thursday night, a day after he visited with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli officials in Tel Aviv. Biden and Israeli officials discussed the ongoing war, and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip. 
The president said he will send Congress an ""urgent budget request"" on Friday ""to fund America's national security
 needs to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine is a smart investment that's going to pay dividends for American security for generations."" 
The president said the package, if approved, will help to ""keep American troops out of harm's way, help us build a world that is safer, more peaceful and more prosperous for our children and grandchildren in Israel."" 
""We must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today,"" Biden said. ""And always the security package I'm sending to Congress and asking Congress to do is an unprecedented commitment to Israel's security that will sharpen Israel's qualitative military edge, which we've committed to the qualitative military edge."" 
Biden said the funding would help to ensure that the Iron Dome ""continues to guard the skies over Israel."" 

""That means protecting civilians in combat as best as they can. And the people of Gaza urgently need food, water and medicine."" 
The president also spoke to President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority Wednesday and said he ""reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people right to dignity and to self-determination."" 
""The actions of Hamas terrorists don't take that right away,"" Biden said. 
But while Biden said he is ""heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life,"" he stressed that the blast that killed hundreds in a hospital in Gaza ""was not done by the Israelis."" 
Israel declared war against Hamas after the terrorist group infiltrated the country on Oct. 7, firing thousands of rockets at residential areas and brutally murdering more than one thousand civilians, while taking hundreds of others hostage. 

""The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world,"" Biden said. ""But sadly, the Jewish people know perhaps better than anyone that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others.""
Biden added: ""Hamas has a stated purpose for existing: it is a destruction of the state of Israel and the murder of Jewish people.""
But the president stressed that Hamas ""does not represent the Palestinian people."" 
""Hamas uses Palestinians civilians as human shields, and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of that,"" Biden said. 
At least 4,200 people have been killed in the war on both sides, including at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 31 Americans. Palestinian health authorities say at least 2,808 Palestinians have been killed and more than 10,950 wounded. 
More than 30 American citizens have died in Israel and 12 are left unaccounted for.

Meanwhile, the president shifted to Russia's war in Ukraine. 
""History has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction--They keep going,"" Biden said. ""And the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising."" 
He added: ""If we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control of Ukraine, he won't limit himself just to the Ukraine."" 
Biden said Putin has ""already threatened to remind, quote, remind Poland that their western land was a gift from Russia. One of his top advisors, a former president of Russia, has called Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Russia's Baltic provinces."" 

""These are all NATO's allies. For 75 years, NATO's kept peace in Europe and has been the cornerstone of American security,"" Biden said. ""And if Putin attacks NATO ally, we will defend every inch of NATO's, which the treaty requires and calls for, will have something that we do not seek."" 
Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.
President Biden said during his Thursday address to the nation that terrorists and dictators must ""pay a price"" for their terror and aggression.
""You know, history has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going, and the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising,"" Biden said from the Oval Office.
""So if we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control of Ukraine, he won't limit himself just to the Ukraine,"" he added.
He went on to tout NATO's peacekeeping success across Europe following World War II.

In his speech Biden also called for Israel not to ""be blinded by rage"" in its response to the Hamas attacks, and said he would send an urgent funding package to Congress in support of it and Ukraine.

President Biden cautioned Israel not to ""be blinded by rage"" in its military response to the brutal attacks by Hamas terrorists that took place on Oct. 7.
In his Thursday address to the nation, Biden implored Israel to learn from America's ""mistakes"" following 9/11.
""When I was in Israel yesterday, I said when Americans experienced the hell of 9/11 we felt enraged as well. While we sought, and got justice we made mistakes. So, I caution the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage,"" he said.

And here in America, let us not forget who we are. We reject all forms, all forms of hate, whether against Muslims, Jews or anyone. That’s what great nations do, and we are a great nation,"" he added.
Biden also said he would be sending an urgent funding request to Congress in support of Israel and Ukraine.


The White House took serious heat on social media Thursday for posting an image of President Biden meeting with U.S. troops in Israel without obscuring their identities.

Though the White House account deleted the photo soon after sharing it on Instagram, X users ripped Biden’s team for the dangerous mistake, accusing the administration of ""compromising"" the troops’ identities while they were in Israel defending U.S. interests in wake of Hamas’ terrorist attack on the U.S. allied country. 
Journalist Sam Shoemate shared an edited image of the post X, claiming that the White House shared it without obscuring the faces of what appeared to be special forces on Wednesday night.

He wrote, ""The Whitehouse media team shared this picture last night (I added the black boxes) without blurring or censoring the faces of the ‘Delta Force’ (CAG) operator’s faces. They deleted it an hour later after hundreds of thousands had already viewed it. This is a massive failure on the Biden admin.""
The caption on the original White House post stated, ""In Israel, President Biden met with first responders to thank them for their bravery and the work they’re doing in response to the Hamas terrorist attacks.""
During a U.S. Department of Defense briefing Thursday, Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder was asked to confirm if the soldiers depicted were in fact U.S. special operators and if there was a policy against taking photos of special forces.
Ryder punted to the White House, stating, ""I'd have to refer you to the White House on that. I just don't have any to provide. Thank you.""

Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin confirmed the White House’s blunder on Thursday afternoon, posting, ""NEW: The White House admits they accidentally doxxed US Special Forces by posting an uncensored photo of them w/ Biden in Israel.""
He added the White House’s statement, which said, ""As soon as this was brought to our attention, we immediately deleted the photo. We regret the error and any issues this may have caused.""
X users berated the White House for this potentially disastrous error. 
U.S. military veteran and author Sean Parnell appeared shocked by the post, writing, ""Holy God. Biden doxed Delta. This without question puts a target on them & their families.""

Fox News contributor Sara Carter wrote, ""Is the White House really this stupid or are they just trying to get people targeted? This is totally unacceptable…These operators are required to maintain a level of discretion that this administration has completely disregarded. I would know, my husband is a retired operator.""
She added, ""They are elite trained fighters and something as simple as facial ID recognition is putting them in direct threat by adversaries. How did this happen White House?""
Republican U.S. Congressional candidate
 in Washington Joe Kent slammed the Biden administration, posting, ""The Biden Admin operates at the confluence of hubris, malice & incompetence. Nothing says thank you for doing our nation’s most dangerous missions like showing every terrorist in the world the identities of our warriors. Democrats can’t be trusted w/our national security.""
CPAC senior fellow and former White House adviser Mercedes Schlapp declared, ""This is the most INCOMPETENT White House. The Biden administration is putting in military danger.""
Conservative commentator Ian Miles Cheong wrote, ""The identities of Delta Force operators are supposed to be highly confidential because of the nature of their work. Biden just blew their cover.""
And Washington Times columnist Charles Hurt condemned White House staff, saying ""the fires of hell are not hot enough for these people.""
White House officials did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for further comment.

President Biden
 announced Thursday he would be submitting a joint urgent budget request to Congress on Friday in support of Israel and Ukraine in their respective wars.
""American leadership holds the world together. American alliances keep America safe. American values make us a partner they want to work with. You put all of that at risk if you walk away from Ukraine and turn our backs on Israel,"" Biden said during his address to the nation.
""Tomorrow I will send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America’s national security needs and support Israel and Ukraine. It’s a smart investment that will pay dividends for American security for generations,"" he said. 
Biden did not specify the amount of the package, but said it would ""keep American troops out of harm's way,"" and would help build a safer world.

He added that it would ""sharpen"" Israel's military, and ensure the nation had what it needed to continue defending itself against terrorist attacks from Hamas.


An American frustrated by activists downplaying Hamas' brutal attack detailed the horrific massacres his family in the Israel Defense Forces have seen.
""Anybody who claims that this didn't happen is just denying the truth and is part of the problem and should be lumped together with the people of Hamas,"" Marc Tobin, who lives in Israel, told Fox News.
In response, Tobin, who has three sons and 13 nephews serving in the IDF, relayed his families' experiences. The IDF sent his middle son to the Gaza border last Monday to find terrorists still in Israel and to ensure survivors were accounted for in the nearby villages. He and his fellow soldiers went door-to-door in Kfar Aza.

""Unfortunately, they saw the massacre,"" Tobin said. ""A lot of the bodies had been put into — already — body bags so they saw all the different sizes of bodies, the adults, the children and unfortunately, the infants.""
Tobin said his son fortunately didn't see the bodies before they were put in bags, ""but there were enough in his unit that did see that people were butchered.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office last week released photos of babiesthat it says Hamas terrorists ""murdered and burned"" in Kfar Aza during the attack. More than 70 of the kibbutz's 765 residents were killed, according to the Times of Israel.
IDF troops
 found about 200 dead, including babies, some of whom they said were decapitated, Israeli media reported. 
""I think Hamas is just like the Nazis were,"" Tobin said.
Tobin said protesters and activists ignoring Hamas' atrocities are taking a page out of Adolf Hitler’s chief propagandist's playbook to create and spread disinformation.
""[Joseph] Goebbels had a strategy of if you say it enough, then people believe it,"" he said.

President Biden is set to address the nation from the Oval Office Thursday night about America's response to Hamas' terrorist attacks against Israel and the war in the region, the White House said. 

The address, which is expected to begin at 8 p.m., comes a day after President Biden visited with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli officials in Tel Aviv. Biden and Israeli officials discussed the ongoing war, and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip. 
Biden has pledged to support Israel, but is expected to announce $100 million humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank. 
""I was very blunt about the need to support getting humanitarian aid to Gaza – get it to Gaza and do it quickly,"" Biden told reporters Wednesday on his trip back to Washington, D.C. 
Biden said he ""got no pushback, virtually none"" from Netanyahu. 
Israel declared 
war against Hamas after the terrorist group infiltrated the country on Oct. 7, firing thousands of rockets at residential areas and brutally murdering more than one thousand civilians, while taking hundreds of others hostage. 
At least 4,200 people have been killed in the war on both sides, including at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 31 Americans. Palestinian health authorities say at least 2,808 Palestinians have been killed and more than 10,950 wounded. 
More than 30 American citizens have died in Israel and 12 are left unaccounted for.
The White House said the president is also expected to discuss ""Russia's ongoing brutal war against Ukraine"" during the address Thursday night. 
The president, during his address, is expected to ask for additional billions of dollars in military assistance for both Israel and Ukraine. 
The funding request, which is expected to be formally rolled out on Friday, is likely to be around $100 billion over the next year. The total figure is expected to include some funding for Taiwan’s defense and for managing the flow of migrants at the southern border with Mexico.

The deputy mayor of Jerusalem demanded ""proof of life"" for the more than 200 hostages estimated to have been taken from Israel by Hamas militants and other assurances before humanitarian aide promised by President Biden or any other government arrives in Gaza for Palestinians. 

""The first thing we need is proof of life. We haven't had anything,"" Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Fleur Hassan-Nahoum told Fox News Digital. ""We haven't had the Red Cross being able to see them. We haven't had the U.N. even talking about the hostages. What happens to our hostages is three and five-month-old babies and their mothers, mothers with three children, young women serially raped, paraded down the street, an old lady with dementia in a wheelchair, people ridiculing her down the street and abusing her. Who are these people and why?""

""This is something that I think we cannot give up on the hostages,"" she said, speaking from Israel via Zoom. ""We need to demand, if you want humanitarian assistance, we understand that. But we need our hostages to be a priority for all governments and for our government. And any type of humanitarian assistance has to be conditional on the assurance that our hostages, especially the injured ones, will at least be having medical treatment. And we haven't had any assurances of anything."" 
President Biden announced Wednesday that the United States is providing $100 million in humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. 

""I'm all for humanitarian aid, but the problem is that the leadership in the West Bank is corrupt. So they steal from their people. They also pay terrorists pension life pensions for every Jew they kill,"" Hassan-Nahoum told Fox News Digital. ""And that's why in the United States, you guys passed the Taylor Force Act after a man called Taylor Force, who essentially was killed, murdered by Palestinian terrorists and his killers are getting a life pension. And the American government passed a law that they wouldn't give any money to the Palestinians until the pay for slay policy was rescinded, which it never was. And so I understand that President Biden is doing this from a good place.""

""It's just very difficult to get decent accountability from the Palestinian leadership,"" she said. ""The most minimum thing I would ask for is to ensure that the money does not go to an educational system. Their educational system is basically teaching hatred and how to kill Jews and Palestinian Authority funds, which they receive from around the world, are paying pensions to people who kill Jews, thereby incentivizing people to kill Jews. And the more you kill, the higher the pension. And so that's my fear.""
""And as long as we can guarantee or the U.S. can guarantee through its different nonprofit arms here in the ground that it is actually going to humanitarian aid, then I'm in favor,"" she said. ""But very few people can actually give us those guarantees."" 
As for the educational system in Palestine and concern in the West over taking in Gazan refugees taught to hate Jews, Hassan-Nahoum added, ""The irony is that the U.N., through their schools that are funded by the international community, are actually teaching this hatred curriculum. So, you know, it's interesting. So you – we get they get money for teaching hatred and then, of course, nobody wants to take them in as refugees. But why are you giving them the money to begin with?""

A U.S. Navy destroyer intercepted several missiles fired near the coast of Yemen on Thursday, though it is unclear what the missiles were targeting, Pentagon officials said.
U.S. Department of Defense spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed Thursday that the crew of the USS Carney, a guided missile destroyer operating in the Northern Red Sea, shot down three land attack cruise missiles and several drones that were launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen.

""This action was a demonstration of the integrated air and missile defense architecture that we have built in the Middle East and that we are prepared to utilize whenever necessary to protect our partners and our interests in this important region,"" Ryder said, adding there were no casualties to U.S. forces, nor any on the ground that he knows of. ""Information on these engagements is still being processed, and we cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting.""
The missiles were launched from Yemen and were heading north along the Red Sea, ""potentially"" toward targets in Israel, Ryder said.
According to Ryder, the response was one the U.S. military would have taken for any similar threat in the region.

""This attack may be ongoing,"" he said. ""As [Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin] has made clear, we have the capability to defend our broader interests in the region.""
""The crew of the Carney did just that, and across the force we will remain vigilant to any other potential threat,"" Ryder added.
The Department of Defense is in the process of bolstering forces in the Middle East to deter a wider conflict, but also bolster stability and defend national security interests.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul visits the Western Wall in Jerusalem on Wednesday. Hochul’s father died overnight while she was touring wartime Israel, with the teary-eyed governor slipping a note grieving the loss into Jerusalem’s Western Wall holy site. Credit: AP

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul learned of her father's death during her ongoing visit to Israel while trying to show support for the Jewish state, and slipped a note grieving her loss into Jerusalem’s Western Wall holy site on Thursday. 

Hochul, a Democrat, learned her father, John Courtney, 87, died overnight from a brain hemorrhage in Florida. The news came on her second day in Israel amid its war with Hamas. 
While at the Western Wall, Hochul appeared to wipe away a tear before placing a handwritten note with prayers for Israel and for her father into a crack in the limestone wall.
""I pray for my father, who cherished his visit to this Holy Land, and who passed during the night,"" Hochul’s handwritten message read, the New York Post reported. 
Her father's death came as Hochul met with Israeli leaders
 and displaced families impacted by Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 cross-border attack on Israeli civilians. Israel has since declared war on the terrorist group. 
More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and roughly 200 others were abducted and taken into Gaza by Hamas. Gaza's Health Ministry said Thursday that 3,785 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 12,500 others have been wounded since the outbreak of the war.
Hochul met
 with Israeli families displaced by the conflict and heard painful stories from families of American citizens taken hostage by Hamas and from Israelis who have been wounded during the fighting. She also held meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s ambassador to the U.S. Michael Herzog, and Israeli President Isaac Herzog, reiterating New York's solidarity with Israel.
A nonprofit organization is funding travel costs for Hochul and her staff, and the state is covering the costs for her security detail, according to the governor’s office.

The State Department is urging a worldwide caution alert Thursday for Americans as tensions increase due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. 
The department cited “potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests” in its alert message.
It urged U.S. citizens abroad to “exercise increased caution.” Earlier this week, the State Department raised its travel alert advisory in Lebanon and warned Americans to avoid traveling to the country amid increased protests and the unstable security situation there. 
Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based terrorist group, has been trading rocket fire with the Israeli military for nearly two weeks.  


State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Thursday that 32 Americans have been confirmed killed in the Israel-Hamas war.
Another 11 Americans are unaccounted for, Miller told reporters at a news conference.
""With respect to our work to secure the release of hostages, that work is ongoing,"" he added. 

At least 4,800 people have been killed in the war on both sides, including at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers since Hamas launched a surprise attack on October 7. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claims at least 3,478 Palestinians have been killed and more than 10,950 wounded. 
President Biden on Wednesday said that freeing Hamas hostages is his administration's top priority. 
There's no higher priority than the release and safe return of all these hostages,"" Biden said in Israel. The president also pledged to ask Congress for an ""unprecedented"" support package for Israel's defense and said he would ask lawmakers for $100 million in humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians in Gaza facing bombardment by Israeli forces.

The Israeli military said Thursday there are a confirmed 203 hostages taken by Hamas and missing individuals in the Gaza Strip, including 30 children and youths and as many as 10-20 elderly.
Another 100-200 people are missing and their fate is unknown, according to new IDF data. Thirteen American citizens remain unaccounted for and are feared to be held hostage in Gaza. 
IDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the families of those taken captive have been notified and that the number is likely to rise as the military gathers more intelligence, the Jewish News Syndicate reported.
Hamas is reportedly claiming that it will ""protect"" its hostages taken during the war with Israel and will only release them ""when circumstances on the ground allow."" 

Those comments surfaced Monday in a video message from Abu Obeida, whom Reuters says is the spokesman of the Palestinian terrorist group’s armed wing. 
Obeida said Hamas has ""a group of detainees of different nationalities, these are our guests and we seek to protect them,"" according to Reuters. 
""We will release detainees of different nationalities when circumstances on the ground allow,"" he reportedly added, without elaborating. 
Israel has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the border with Gaza and is anticipated to soon launch a ground invasion with the purpose of rescuing hostages and eradicating Hamas.

The ""CBS Evening News"" was roasted Wednesday night for a social media post that suggested Israel was to blame for the explosion that rocked the al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City despite President Biden and the Israeli government saying otherwise. 

""CBS Evening News"" wrote on X, the platform formally known as Twitter, that the ""humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to grow following a hospital explosion that killed hundreds. CBS News spoke to a doctor who says Israel's army had previously warned the facility to evacuate.""  
The quickly ridiculed CBS post accompanied a video in which a Gaza woman said they got ""bombed,"" and the CBS News reporter put an emphasis on Palestinian claims that an Israeli rocket previously struck the hospital. CBS then spoke with a doctor who suggested Israel was at fault, and put a spotlight on injured children before finally mentioning that President Biden said the Israeli military is not to blame more than a minute into the video. 

""From the street of Tehran to war-torn Yemen, few believe the president and say Israel is squarely responsible for the explosion as well as the widespread misery unfolding in Gaza,"" CBS reporter Imtiaz Tyab said. 
Readers added context to the misleading CBS post, and it was slapped with a community note that said ""President Joe Biden has confirmed that the explosion was most likely a result of the misfiring of a Hamas missile. Video also shows that the explosion was in a car park and does not appear to have demolished any buildings.""
The CBS News segment shared to over 400,000 followers never explained that the Israeli government determined the blast was caused by a rocket misfire launched by Islamic Jihad
, another terrorist organization active in Gaza. It also failed to mention the widespread backlash the mainstream media has faced for believing the Hamas-backed health ministry in Gaza’s claim that Israel struck a hospital in the first place. 
Many were quick to mock CBS for the post. 
""This is literally disinformation,"" one person wrote as another added, ""Did Hamas write this tweet?""

The Israel Defense Forces said Thursday military leaders are currently approving operational plans for a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. 
""As part of the completion of the preparation for the continuation of the fighting, the approval of operational plans and the deployment of forces in the field are currently happening,"" the IDF said, adding that Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, the head of the IDF Southern Command, was touring the units currently stationed in southern Israel. 

”Now, our maneuvers are going to take the war into their territory. It's going to be long, it's going to be intense, the best commanders and soldiers are here,"" Finkelman told troops at the front lines, according to IDF. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also visited troops near the Gaza border Thursday and assured them that Israel will prevail in the conflict with Hamas.
""We are going to win with all our might,” Netanyahu said, according to the Times of Israel. “All of Israel is behind you, and we are going to heavily strike our enemies so that we can achieve victory.”
Israel has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the border with Gaza after Hamas infiltrated the Jewish state through the south and slaughtered hundreds of Israelis on October 7. An Israeli invasion to eradicate the terrorist group has been anticipated for days and it is unclear when it will begin.

Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant
 told ground troops at the border with Gaza to prepare to invade the Palestinian territory, but he did not say when the invasion would start, according to the Associated Press.
In a meeting with soldiers at the border Thursday, Gallant urged forces to ""get organized, be ready"" for orders to advance. 
“Whoever sees Gaza from afar now, will see it from the inside,” he said. “I promise you.”
Israel has massed tens of thousands of troops along the border following a bloody Oct. 7 cross-border massacre by Hamas terrorists.

Israeli airstrikes continued to pound the Gaza Strip Thursday in a relentless retaliatory assault for the atrocities committed by Hamas. At least 4,800 people have been killed in the war on both sides, including at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 31 Americans when Hamas terrorists infiltrated southern Israel on October 7.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claims at least 3,478 Palestinians have been killed and more than 10,950 wounded. Twelve American citizens remain unaccounted for.

A Christian Israeli living three miles from the border with Lebanon said he evacuated his family because he believes Hezbollah is a more powerful enemy than Hamas.

""There's no reason for kids and children to hear those explosions,"" Shadi Khaloul said. ""As a responsible father, I just sent them away from here, and I asked them to just pray for us.""
Since Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 attack, there have been fears of Hezbollah — an Iran-backed terrorist group in Lebanon — entering the war. Israel evacuated its residents that live within 1.2 miles from Lebanon on Monday amid cross-border fire, including Hezbollah launching anti-tank missiles into the Jewish state.
""Our family was evacuated, too, by itself,"" he said. ""We didn't wait for the military to actually ask us because I know the scenario and what will happen if this front will really open widely.""

Khaloul, 47, said he evacuated his wife, children, brother, and sister-in-law, as well as his nieces and nephews to Europe, though he didn't specify which country ""for security reasons.""
""I am here with my parents,"" Khaloul said, adding that he hasn’t evacuated because ""I am here to defend our home, community and Israel.""
Khaloul, who is a major for the Israeli Defense Forces' reserves and was previously a paratrooper, said he believes Hezbollah is more dangerous than Hamas because of its involvement assisting President Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war.
""They, in the last 10 years, were well-trained in a war — active war — in Syria,"" he said. ""They already know how to fight. They know how to use military equipment and how to fight physically other forces.""


Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee pressed President Biden's nominee for ambassador to Israel, Democrat Jack Lew, on his past work on Iran sanctions during a nomination hearing Wednesday. 

Several pro-Palestinian demonstrators protesting against Israel disrupted the first few minutes of the hearing. After they were escorted out, the meeting continued uninterrupted. 
Lew defended his record on the Iran deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and asserted he would work to advance a ""negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""
""I want to be clear, Iran is a threat to regional stability and to Israel's existence,"" Lew said. ""If confirmed, I will uphold President Biden's commitment to deny Iran a nuclear weapon."" 
In 2018, a Senate report by the investigative subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee found that Lew, during his tenure as secretary to the Treasury under the Obama administration, ""granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system.""  

The report found that the administration tried to convert $5.7 billion from U.S. banks to Iranian assets. It noted that the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ""encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds.""

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., introduced a bill Thursday to reallocate the $6 billion in Iranian funds to Israeli defense amid Israel's war against Hamas.
The bill seeks to take the $6 billion, which was released to Iran in September as part of a negotiation for the release of five American prisoners, and put it into an account for Israel to use in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas. 

""As the Iranian-backed terror group Hamas continues its barbaric attacks against the Israeli people, the United States must stand firmly by our biggest ally in the Middle East,"" Daines said in a statement. ""The United States must not only restrict Iran’s access to Biden’s $6 billion ransom payment but also repurpose those funds to help Israel recover from these horrific actions.""
The bill also proposes that frozen Iranian assets beyond the initial $6 billion cannot be unfrozen or utilized until the president confirms to Congress that hostilities between Hamas, other Iranian-backed groups, and Israel have ceased; until full compensation has been provided to Israel for damages caused by attacks; or until Iran is actively participating in an internationally agreed mechanism to compensate Israel for determined amounts owed.

Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., wants to ban any federal student aid from going to colleges and universities that facilitate or promote events with an antisemitic message.

The new legislation introduced Thursday comes in the wake of dozens of anti-Israel rallies hosted by student groups, and in some cases encouraged by faculty, following the devastating Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack that killed the most Jews in a single day since the Holocaust.
The Stop Antisemitism on College Campuses Act would keep those schools from eligibility for Title IV funds, which includes federal student aid. As a reference point, in the 2020-2021 school year, the total Title IV funding dispersed by the federal government was roughly $125 billion.
Scott, a 2024 GOP presidential hopeful, said this legislation, which will also have a companion measure in the House, ""hits"" the colleges ""where it hurts – their pocketbooks.""

""Any university or college that peddles blatant antisemitism, especially after Hamas’ brutal attack on Israeli civilians, women and children, has no place molding the minds of future generations, never mind receiving millions of taxpayer funds to do so,"" said Scott.
""We must not only call out this hate but crush it wherever it rears its ugly head. If these schools don’t change their ways, my legislation hits them where it hurts – their pocketbooks,"" he said.
""No college or university should receive a single cent from the federal government to fund violent antisemitism,"" he added.

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL - OCTOBER 19: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (R) meets Israeli President Isaac Herzog (L) in Tel Aviv, Israel on October 19, 2023.

United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Israel on Thursday, when he held diplomatic talks with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and condemned Hamas, a terrorist group that governs Gaza, for their ruthless assault on Oct. 7, when they slaughtered more than 1,400 Israelis in a single day.
Sunak’s visit came on the 13th day of Israel's war with Hamas, and he minced no words in describing the terror group. 
""First and foremost, I want to express my solidarity with you and your country after you have suffered something unspeakable, a barbaric act of terrorism, as you said, we should call it what it is: an act of terrorism perpetrated by an evil terrorist organization, Hamas.""

""We will stand with Israel, we will stand with you in solidarity with your people and your right to defend yourself, to bring security back to your country, to your people, to ensure the safe return of the hostages that have been taken,"" Sunak said. ""Because that's the right thing to do. You have not just a right to do that, I think you have a duty to do that, to restore that security to your country. But I'm also grateful to you for the support that the Israeli government has provided to the families and British nationals who have been caught up in this tragedy.""
The unequivocal moral distinction comes as some U.S. lawmakers, including Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., repeated a debunked claim that Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) were responsible for an explosion that struck a Gaza hospital, reportedly killing hundreds of civilians. On Wednesday, Tlaib also accused the Biden administration of funding a ""genocide"" against Palestinians.


Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., walked back her comments on social media blaming Israel for the explosion that occurred at a Gaza hospital but stopped short of offering an apology.

Many prominent progressives and members of the media rushed to believe Hamas' claims that an Israeli airstrike was responsible for an attack on the hospital where hundreds of civilians were reportedly killed.
However, both the IDF and the Biden administration have debunked the terrorist group's narrative, saying the explosion came from a misfired rocket from the Islamic Jihad. But not before it sparked international outcry with riots erupting in multiple countries. 

""Our office cited an AP report yesterday that the IDF had hit a Baptist hospital in Gaza,"" Omar wrote Wednesday night. ""Since then, the IDF denied responsibility and the US intelligence assessment is that this was not done by Israel. It is a reminder that information is often unreliable and disputed in the fog of war (especially on Twitter where misinformation is rampant). We all have a responsibility to ensure information we are sharing is from credible sources and to acknowledge as new reports come in.""
She added, ""It is critical that we have a fully independent investigation to determine conclusively who is responsible for this war crime.""

The first U.S. shipment of military aid to Israel arrived Thursday, the Israeli Ministry of Defense said.
A cargo plane carrying armored vehicles to replace those damaged in the war with Hamas landed at Ben Gurion Airport, officials said.

""This delivery is part of a large-scale procurement operation led by the Israel Ministry of Defense's Directorate of Production and Procurement (DOPP) and the US Procurement Mission, aimed at bolstering the IDF's fleet of vehicles to address a range of operational scenarios,"" the Israeli Ministry of Defense said. 
The delivery is part of a larger NIS 400 million procurement to bolster the Israeli army's vehicle fleet, according to a news release.
""This procurement effort aligns with the specific needs of the IDF and encompasses a diverse array of specialized vehicles, including armored ambulances, operational armored vehicles, tactical trucks, and mechanical engineering equipment,"" the defense ministry said. 
Officials said several hundred more vehicles are currently en route to Israel for use by the IDF.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said he is taking responsibility for the surprise terror attack by Hamas in which hundreds of Israelis were massacred on October 7. 
“I am responsible for the defense establishment. I was responsible for it in the last two weeks, even in the difficult incidents, and I am responsible for bringing it to victory in the battle,” Gallant told reporters Thursday.
“We will be precise and deadly and we will continue until we complete the mission,” Gallant said.

Israel was caught off guard on October 7 when hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrated the country by land, sea and air, ravaging communities near the border with Gaza and raping, torturing and killing civilians both young and old. 
The New York Times reported that Israeli intelligence had detected a surge of activity on some of the Gaza terrorist networks it monitors in the hours before the attack. But for reasons unknown, Israeli soldiers on the Gaza border did not respond to an alert.
Hamas then used drones to take out Israeli communications and surveillance, which allowed terrorists to breach the border fence. Thousands of Palestinians rushed through the border and committed atrocities in more than 20 Israeli towns and army bases in what was the worst terror attack in the nation's 75-year history.


Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., on Wednesday sent a letter ""formally requesting"" that Capitol police save security footage and arrest records from the massive House protest demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and likened the demonstration to the Jan. 6 riot. 
Greene shared on X a copy of the letter addressed to U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger asking that his department ""preserve all video surveillance footage, photographic evidence, police reports and arrests records from all House Office Buildings on October 18, 2023."" 

""The group that organized the insurrection, Jewish Voice for Peace, is a pro-Islamic anti-Semitic group that seeks the destruction of the state of Israel, according to the Anti-Defamation League,"" the letter says. In describing the demonstration as an ""insurrection,"" Greene echoed the verbiage used by the House Jan. 6 committee to describe the 2021 riot at the Capitol while Congress was certifying President Biden's victory over former President Trump. 
""These actors caused elevators to be shut down, staircases and hallways to be blocked, exits to be made inaccessible, and official legislative business to be obstructed, putting Members of Congress, their staffs, and Capitol visitors at risk,"" Greene said of the demonstration.

CC’ing Chairman Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., Greene also said the Committee on House Administration ""must investigate this incident and review all footage and evidence provided by Capitol Police, and the insurrectionists involved must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

 killed the head of the Hamas-led national security forces, Jehad Mheisen, and members of his family in their house, a Hamas news agency reported Thursday, according to Reuters.
The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza said earlier the Palestinian death toll has risen to 3,785, including 1,524 children, 1,000 women and 120 older people. The casualty counts reported by Hamas do not distinguish between civilians and terrorists. 
Additionally, Palestinian authorities say 12,493 people have been wounded since Israel began its bombardment campaign after Hamas launched a surprise attack that killed more than 1,400 Israelis on October 7. 
Israel has said hundreds of Palestinians were killed by terrorist rockets launched from Gaza that fell short of targets in Israel, including one that caused an explosion at a hospital parking lot in Gaza. 

Israel Defense Forces has also said it recovered the bodies of about 1,500 Hamas terrorists inside its territory since October 7.

An iconic Jewish deli in New York City that has publicly supported Israel after the terror attacks by Hamas was vandalized with a swastika.
The vandals targeted a 2nd Ave Deli location in the Upper East Side on the corner of 1st Avenue and 75th Street, FOX 5 New York reported.
Since the October 7 terror attacks on Israel, the deli has posted several pro-Israel messages on its Instagram page. 

""We Stand with Israel. We stand against the clear evil that has once again shown itself today,"" one post read.
FBI Director Christopher Wray on Saturday warned of a spike in domestic threats linked to Israel's war against Hamas terrorists.
""History has been witness to antisemitic and other forms of violent extremism for far too long. Whether that be from foreign terrorist organizations, or those inspired by them, or domestic violent extremists motivated by their own racial animus, the targeting of a community because of their faith is completely unacceptable,"" Wray said. ""We remain committed to continue confronting those threats—both here in the United States and overseas."" 



President Biden has placed a condition on humanitarian aid going into the Gaza Strip, as Israel said Wednesday it will allow Egypt to deliver limited supplies for civilians. The aid will be the first assistance given to Gaza since Israel imposed a punishing 10-day siege on the territory.
The announcement to allow water, food and other supplies happened after Biden visited Israel Wednesday hoping to prevent a wider conflict in the region. During his one-day visit to Israel, Biden announced $100 million in humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank but said if Hamas confiscates the aid ""it will end.""
Biden's visit tried to strike a balance between showing U.S. support for Israel amid its war with Hamas while expressing concern for the civilian casualties. He unequivocally said the U.S. stands with Israel and its right to defend itself from Hamas terror attacks but attempted to dampen growing alarm among Arab allies that the current war could escalate into a wider conflict.
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the approval to allow the aid was given after Biden requested it. He said Israel ""will not thwart"" deliveries of food, water or medicine from Egypt, as long as they don’t go to Hamas militants.


A Hezbollah official is warning that the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group is ""thousands of times stronger"" than before, and that U.S., Israel and other ""malicious Europeans"" should be careful, reports say. 
The comments were made Wednesday by senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine during a rally in a suburb of Beirut, where protesters also waved Hezbollah and Palestinian flags and chanted ""Death to America and Israel,"" according to The Guardian. 
""The response to the mistake you might make with our resistance will be resounding,"" Safieddine also was quoted by Reuters as saying. ""Because what we have is faith, and God is stronger than you, all your battleships, and all your weapons."" 
The fiery remarks came on the same day President Biden visited Israel and cautioned other countries from becoming involved in the Israel-Hamas war. 
""The world will know that Israel is stronger than ever. And my message to any state or any other hostile actor thinking about attacking Israel remains the same as it was a week ago. Don't, don't, don't,"" Biden said. 

""And later this week, I'm going to ask the United States Congress for an unprecedented support package for Israel's defense. We're going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied to continue standing sentinel over Israeli skies, saving Israeli lives,"" he added. ""We moved U.S. military assets to the region, including positioning the USS Ford carrier strike group in the eastern Mediterranean with the USS Eisenhower on the way to deter further aggression against Israel and to prevent this conflict from spreading.""

A U.S. defense official tells Fox News one-way drones targeted al-Tanf, a U.S. base in Syria on Wednesday, the same day as the attempted drone attacks in Iraq. Al-Tanf is on Syria's border with Iraq. 
It is unclear how many drones and if there are any injuries or damage to the base. 
On Wednesday, the U.S. intercepted two one-way attack drones targeting Iraq's al-Asad air base where American troops are located, two defense officials confirmed to Fox News. 

The incident happened early Wednesday morning local time and no injuries were reported. 
Defense officials tell Fox News the U.S. currently has about 900 U.S. forces in Syria and 2,500 troops in Iraq. 
Reuters first reported the thwarted attack, citing two U.S. officials who said the two drones were intercepted before they could strike. 
The officials who spoke on condition on anonymity declined to say who was believed to have been responsible for sending the one-way drones toward the base hosting American troops. 
The foiled attack in Iraq came hours after a blast at a Gaza hospital that Hamas claims killed hundreds of Palestinians. 
Israel said the explosion at the Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian terrorists, while Palestinian authorities claimed it was an Israeli strike.

The Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that security forces arrested 80 terror suspects in the West Bank, including 63 Hamas operatives. 

The arrests were made as part of a ""wide-scale counterterrorism activity"" conducted by IDF, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the Israel Border Police. In a joint statement, the Israeli forces said 524 wanted suspects were arrested across the West Bank and Jordan Valley since the surprise attack on October 7, and that ""over 330 of them are operatives of Hamas."" Israeli security forces also confiscated more than 50 weapons, IDF said.
Additionally, Israeli security forces said they demolished the home of a terrorist, Ahmed Yasin Jidan, who carried out a shooting attack in July that killed IDF Staff Sergeant Shilo Yosef Amir, local Israeli news station i24 News reported. IDF said that suspects threw stones at security forces during the demolition and the army responded ""with measures to disperse demonstrations.""

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday in Beijing urged visiting Egyptian Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly to open a humanitarian corridor for civilians fleeing the war in Gaza, the Associated Press reported.
Xi also reiterated China’s backing of the formation of a Palestinian state as solution to the ongoing violence, according to the AP.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in contact with his Chinese counterpart last week and urged Beijing to use its influence in the Middle East to prevent other state or non-state actors from joining the conflict between Israel and Hamas, the State Department said. 
Blinken spoke with Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi during his tour of the Middle East, where he met officials from Arab nations to rally support for Israel amid its war with Hamas. The Biden administration is concerned that Lebanese terrorists with Hezbollah may attack Israel, opening a two-front war, and seeks to prevent that disastrous outcome.
Iran, which backs Hezbollah
, has called the Israeli bombardment of Gaza ""crimes"" and warned that Muslims and so-called resistance forces will join the war if Israel does not cease fire.
""If the crimes continue, Muslims will be impatient, resistance forces will be impatient, and nobody will be able to prevent them,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tuesday. ""Bombardments should be immediately stopped, Muslim nations are angry.""


President Biden on Wednesday, during a visit to Israel, pledged ""$100 million in new U.S. funding for humanitarian assistance in both Gaza and the West Bank."" 
""This money will support more than 1 million displaced and conflict-affected Palestinians, including emergency needs in Gaza,"" he said.
The president made the large commitment in a speech delivered after he met with Israeli leaders to discuss the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Biden said at least 31 Americans have been killed in the conflict so far and that his highest priority is the return of hostages taken captive by Hamas. 

""Later this week, I'm going to ask the United States Congress for unprecedented support package for Israel's defense. We're going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied to continue standing sentinel over Israeli skies, saving lives,"" Biden also said. ""We move U.S. military assets to the region, including positioning the USS Ford carrier strike group in the eastern Mediterranean with the USS Eisenhower on the way to deter further aggression Israel and to prevent this conflict from spreading.""
Speaking about efforts to rescue hostages, Biden said ""To those who are living in limbo, waiting desperately to learn the fate of a loved one, especially to families of the hostages – You're not alone. We're working with partners throughout the region, pursuing every avenue to bring home those who are being held captive by Hamas..""

Hamas is reported be holding around 199 Israelis and other foreign nationals, while as of Wednesday, 13 Americans remain unaccounted for since the beginning of its new war with Israel.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized the president's $100 million ""gift"" to Hamas, asserting that money intended for humanitarian aid will end up funding terrorism.
“We know Hamas is going to commandeer that money and Hamas is going to use it to advance terrorism,” the Republican presidential candidate said in a video message. “I say no U.S. tax dollars to the Gaza Strip.”

Iran-backed terror group Hamas likely used North Korean weapons during its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, analysis and various evidence, including a militant video and weapons seized by Israel, now show, according to the Associated Press.
A video of Hamas terrorists using a F-7 rocket-propelled grenade, allegedly made by North Korea, is at the center of the controversy after the country denied selling arms to the terrorist group. The shoulder-fired weapon fires a single warhead and can be quickly reloaded, making them ideal for attacks against armored vehicles.
The video of the men with the North Korean-made weapon was confirmed through analysis by two experts on North Korean arms and South Korean military intelligence, according to the AP, who also conducted an analysis of weapons captured on the battlefield.
""It is not a surprise to see North Korean weapons with Hamas,"" said Matt Schroeder, a senior researcher with Small Arms Survey who wrote a guide to Pyongyang’s light weapons.

In addition to the F-7 rocket launcher, Hamas propaganda videos and photos have included North Korea's Bulsae guided anti-tank missile. Hamas also used North Korea's Type 58 self-loading rifle, a variant of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, according to N.R. Jenzen-Jones, a weapons expert who works as the director of the consultancy Armament Research Services.
Jenzen-Jones cited imagery of the weapons wielded by Hamas terrorists.
""North Korea has long supported Palestinian militant groups, and North Korean arms have previously been documented amongst interdicted supplies,"" Jenzen-Jones told The AP.

State-affiliated outlet Korean Central News Agency published a full-throated repudiation of military experts claiming there is evidence North Korean weapons are being used by Hamas.
""The U.S. administration's reptile press bodies and quasi-experts are spreading a groundless and false rumor that 'North Korea's weapons' seemed to be used for the attack on Israel,"" wrote North Korean international affairs commentator Ri Kwang-song.
""It is nothing but a bid to shift the blame for the Middle East crisis caused by its wrong hegemonic policy onto a third country and thus evade the international criticism focused on the empire of evil.""

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., issued strong statements in support of Israel on Wednesday in which he struck down calls for a ceasefire and questioned those who blamed the deadly hospital blast in Gaza on Israel.

Fetterman, who immediately condemned Hamas' terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday afternoon that it's ""truly disturbing"" members of Congress were quick to take the word of Hamas, who blamed the death of hundreds at a Gaza hospital on an Israeli airstrike, over ""our key ally.""
""Who would take the word of a group that just massacred innocent Israeli civilians over our key ally?"" the Pennsylvania senator asked on X.
He continued: ""I will always stand with Israel and look forward to supporting any military, intelligence, or humanitarian aid to get the job done.""

A few hours later, Fetterman continued to address the Israel-Hamas war by saying Hamas' attacks are the reason why thousands of innocent Israelis and Palestinians are dead and ""now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire.""
In a thread on X, the congressman wrote:
""Innocent Israelis were the victims of a terrorist attack that resulted in the largest loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust. Now we know that the tragedy at the Gaza hospital was not caused by Israel.
""I grieve for every innocent person and brave Israeli soldier killed since Hamas started this war. If not for the horrific attacks by Hamas terrorists, thousands of innocent Israelis and Palestinians would still be alive today.

""Now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. We must support Israel in efforts to eliminate the Hamas terrorists who slaughtered innocent men, women, and children. Hamas does not want peace, they want to destroy Israel. We can talk about a ceasefire after Hamas is neutralized.
""In the meantime, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to quickly deliver the aid our ally Israel needs. This includes confirming ambassador-nominee Jack Lew as soon as possible.""

President Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office on Thursday to discuss the wars in Israel and Ukraine, the White House said. 
Biden will deliver his speech at 8 p.m. ET. 

“Tomorrow, President Biden will address the nation to discuss our response to Hamas’ terrorist attacks against Israel and Russia’s ongoing brutal war against Ukraine,” a White House statement said. 
Biden visited Israel on Wednesday where he spoke with Israeli officials about the ongoing war with Hamas and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip. 
He has pledged to support Israel while at the same time providing military aid to Ukraine amid its war with Russia.


The United States Navy is sending another warship to the eastern Mediterranean as tensions in the Middle East rise amid the Israel-Hamas war.

The USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20), the Navy's command and control ship, left Gaeta, Italy, on Wednesday to join the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group and the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group in support of U.S. operations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
Operating as the most sophisticated Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) ship ever commissioned, according to the Navy, the USS Mount Whitney was the tactical command hub for the U.S. military's Operation Odyssey Dawn against the Libyan regime in 2011.

""USS Mount Whitney incorporates various elements of the most advanced C4I equipment and gives the embarked Joint Task Force Commander the capability to effectively command widely dispersed air, ground and maritime units in an integrated fashion,"" the Navy said in a release, adding that ""the ship's afloat communications capability is second to none.""

More than 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers have died since Hamas launched a surprise attack on Oct. 7. Retaliatory strikes from Israel have killed more than 4,000 Palestinians and injured thousands more, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Piker launched the fundraiser about a week ago. Fans raised $180,000 in the first 40 minutes and surpassed $1 million as of Wednesday afternoon. Piker kicked in at least $50,000, according to the Tiltify page.
The funds will be split between ANERA, Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, Palestine Red Crescent Society and Medical Aid for Palestinians, according to Piker.

State Department officials previously warned that sending U.S. aid to the Gaza Strip could risk benefiting terrorist groups, while also arguing that such a trade-off is necessary for national security.
""We assess there is a high risk Hamas could potentially derive indirect, unintentional benefit from U.S. assistance to Gaza,"" the State Department wrote in a March 2021 draft sanctions exemption request obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

"Qatar brokers deal between Egypt, Hamas and Israel for limited Gaza evacuations",2023-11-01,Fox News,['Anders Hagstrom'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the casualties from southern Israel. 
Egypt, Israel and Hamas have come to an agreement allowing limited evacuations out of Gaza and into Egypt through the Rafah crossing following negotiations this week.
Qatari officials mediated the talks and came to the agreement early Wednesday. The deal allows for foreign passport holders and some critically injured Gaza residents to evacuate, though no timeline has been set for how long the crossing will remain open, a source briefed on the deal told Reuters.
Dozens of foreign passport holders reportedly could be seen entering the crossing Wednesday morning in evidence of the deal.
The negotiations came as the Israeli military has been carrying out the second stage of its war against Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces have greatly expanded ground operations in Gaza, clearing Hamas terrorists out of their fortified positions and tunnels.

Secretary of State
 Antony Blinken called on Iraqi Prime Minster Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to protect installations hosting American personnel amid a series of attacks in recent weeks, the State Department said. 
U.S. military servicemembers have been targeted in dozens of attacks in the region, many with drones. 
“The Secretary called on the Iraqi government to fulfill its commitments to protect all installations hosting U.S. personnel at its invitation and to pursue those responsible for attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq,” the State Department said. 
The Biden administration has accused Iran-linked groups of being behind the incidents. 

Blinken and al-Sudani also discussed the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and the need to contain the conflict, the State Department said.


Israel’s specialized canine unit, Oketz, performed the key task of saving the lives of civilians and soldiers by alerting them to potential dangers, including explosives and weapon caches, even at the expense of their own lives.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) boasts one of the most cutting-edge fighting forces, having integrated artificial intelligence into many of its operations, but some tasks still require an old-school approach. This is where the Oketz unit makes its mark.
""There are a few types of dogs used by the unit, some are confidential, most of them are types of [shepherds],"" an officer known as ""Major A,"" an operative canine warfare school commander for the Oketz unit, told Fox News Digital.

""They are used for three main reasons: tactical dogs that are used to identify enemies; explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) dogs for finding explosives and others; and search and rescue dogs that took a vital part in this war in Israel and Gaza,"" Major A said.
Major A could not divulge how many dogs serve in the unit – the total remaining confidential – but he said it has counted ""hundreds of dogs.""
Video provided by the IDF shows the dogs in action: in one clip, identifying a booby-trapped car; in another, clearing a room before soldiers enter.
The Oketz unit helped the Marom Special Operations Brigade expose roughly 50 booby-trapped explosive devices and dozens of weapons stockpiles before the four-day cease-fire, which has now extended two more days as Hamas continues to release hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli custody and further pauses in the fighting.

""I am horrified by the fact that statements I made on a recent podcast offended the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities, communities I truly love and respect,"" Margulies told Deadline on Friday. ""I want to be 100% clear: Racism, homophobia, sexism, or any prejudice against anyone’s personal beliefs or identity are abhorrent to me, full stop.""

She continued, ""Throughout my career I have worked tirelessly to combat hate of all kind, end antisemitism, speak out against terrorist groups like Hamas, and forge a united front against discrimination. I did not intend for my words to sow further division, for which I am sincerely apologetic.""
During an interview on the Nov. 20 episode of ""The Back Room"" podcast, Margulies sounded off on the support for Hamas on college campuses across the country following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks against Israel.
""Who's teaching these kids because the fact that the entire Black community isn't standing with us, to me, says either they just don't know or they've been brainwashed to hate Jews,"" Margulies said.

In a statement, Smith said his home in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue was targeted Thursday night.  

""Last night, my house was vandalized by people advocating for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. This attack is sadly reflective of the coarsening of the political discourse in our country, and is completely unwarranted, unnecessary, and harmful to our political system,"" Smith said. 
""Throughout the course of my career, my staff and I have continually met with groups from all parts of the political spectrum, including Pro-Palestinian and left-wing activists, and I remain open to meeting with these groups and discussing our differences and where we can come together in a productive and peaceful way,” he added. “We must engage with politics in this way and reject the rise in political violence that we have witnessed over the past several years.""

Other lawmakers have been targeted in vandalism attacks.

The United Nations head of relief is urging for Israel and Hamas to enter another cease-fire on humanitarian grounds as both sides resumed fighting on Friday.  
Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said people in the Gaza Strip have nowhere safe to flee, in a statement. 
“Almost two months into the fighting, the children, women and men of Gaza are all terrified,” he said. “They have nowhere safe to go and very little to survive on. They live surrounded by disease, destruction and death.“
""This is unacceptable,” he added. 
The Israel Defense Forces resumed fighting against Hamas Friday, following a temporary truce amid several prisoner exchanges and the flow of humanitarian aid into the Hamas-controlled territory. 
Israeli forces dropped leaflets in the Gaza city of  Khan Younis on Friday, warning that the southern city was a “dangerous battle zone.” Other leaflets warned Gazans in the north to head south. 
“The past week offered us a glimpse of what can happen when the guns fall silent,” Griffiths said. “The situation in Khan Younis today is a shocking reminder of what happens when they don’t.”

Israel will not renew a visa for a top United Nations humanitarian official for the Gaza Strip and West Bank, the U.N. said.   
Lynn Hastings has served as the special coordinator for the Middle East peace process and U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian Territory for nearly three years, Reuters reported. 
""We've been informed by the Israeli authorities that they would not renew the visa of Ms Hastings past the due date at some point later this month,"" U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. 
Dujarric didn’t say whether Hastings will be replaced.  
In October, Israel accused Hastings of failing to be impartial, which the U.N. rejected.  
""You've seen some very public attacks on Twitter against her which were utterly unacceptable,"" Dujarric said. ""Personal direct attacks on U.N. personnel anywhere around the world is unacceptable and puts people's lives at risks."" 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the conflict in Hamas-controlled Gaza has become an “epic humanitarian catastrophe.”

An Atlanta protester tried lighting themselves on fire outside the Israeli consulate on Friday in what authorities said was most likely an act of political protest.  
A security guard tried to intervene and was also burned on the wrist and leg, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said at a news conference.  
A Palestinian flag was recovered at the scene. The protester was badly burned and transported to Grady Memorial Hospital in critical condition. 
The protester and security guard were taken to a hospital.  

Officials don't believe the incident was terrorism, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said in a press briefing, calling it likely an ""extreme act of political protest."" 
“We are saddened to learn of the self-immolation at the entrance to the office building. It is tragic to see the hate and incitement toward Israel expressed in such a horrific way,"" said Anat Sultan-Dadon, Consul General of Israel to the Southeastern United States.
""The sanctity of life is our highest value,"" he added. ""Our prayers are with the security officer who was injured while trying to prevent this tragic act. We are grateful to the city of Atlanta’s law enforcement and first responders for all they do to ensure safety.”

Ofra Keidar, 70, has died while in Hamas captivity, the Kibbutz Be'eri said Friday.

A sixth hostage died while being held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, her kibbutz said Friday.  
Ofra Keidar, 70, was taken by Hamas terrorist fighters on Oct, 7, the Kibbutz Be'eri  said in a news release. The kibbutz said it learned of her death on Friday.  
Keidar’s husband, Sami, was killed at his home on the day of the attack.  
“The kibbutz community embraces Ofra's family - her children - Elad, Oren and Yael, her grandchildren, and all her family members, and shares in their unbearable grief,” the kibbutz said.  

The names of five other hostages who have died while being held by Hamas were also released Friday.


Israel said its air force attacked terrorist infrastructure in Gaza on Friday as fighting resumed after a days-long truce that expired hours earlier. 
The Israel Defense Forces
 said fighter jets targeted “military headquarters where Hamas terrorists operated, underground sites and a military building from which anti-tank missiles were launched at fighters earlier today,” in a post on X. 
“IDF forces attacked a number of terrorist squads throughout the Gaza Strip, including a squad identified by observers of the Northern Brigade in the Gaza Division,” the IDF said.  
The Israeli air force also eliminated two squads that launched mortars at IDF forces in Gaza, authorities said.  
The military operation came hours after a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas expired Friday morning.  
During the cease-fire, hostages and Palestinian prisoners were exchanged.

Israel confirmed the death of a fifth hostage being held in Gaza on Friday.  
Eliyahu Margalit, 75, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, died and her body was being held by Hamas, Daniel Hagri, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said during a news briefing.  
Margalit’s daughter, Nili Margalit was released from captivity Thursday night.  The bodies of five hostages who died in Gaza are still being held by Hamas, authorities said.

All five were members of the Kibbutz Nir Oz. 
Guy Illouz, 26, a fourth hostage, was determined to be dead, a news release announcing the deaths said. Illouz was a musician soundman and was kidnapped from the Nova Music festival on Oct. 7.  
Aria (Zalman) Zalmanowicz, 85, founder of the Kibbutz Nir Oz, has also died. Hamas released a video of him appearing ill a few weeks ago.
Zalman was a father of two and grandfather of five. Maya Goren, 56, was a kindergarten teacher whose husband, Avner Goren, was killed during the Hamas attack last month.  
Ronen Engel, 54, was a photographer, a volunteer in Magen David Adom, the national EMS organization.
His wife and two daughters were abducted to Gaza on and released this week.
White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Friday that four Americans have been released by Hamas from the Gaza Strip, not six as he previously announced yesterday.

""I said the number of American hostages that we got out was six. And obviously, that's incorrect. It's four. So I apologize for the error, but the error was mine and it was just as a result of misspeaking,"" Kirby said.
Kirby also said the U.S. on Friday continues to work with Israel, Egypt and Qatar to restore the cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.
""But let's be clear about this. It's because of Hamas that this pause ended, that they were just simply unable, failed to produce a list of hostages that could help enable that pause from extending,"" Kirby told reporters. ""So the onus is on Hamas to be able to produce a list of hostages that can get out so that we can try to get this pause back in place. 

""What I can tell you is that the president and the entire national security team will continue to remain deeply engaged on this as we continue to want to see more hostages released and more aid getting in,"" Kirby added, noting that ""if Hamas truly, as they claim to do care about Palestinians, they'll do what they can to come up with a list of hostages that can be exchanged so that that aid can continue to flow.""

Israel is hoping to create a buffer zone on the Palestinian side of the Gaza Strip to protect itself against future attacks following the conclusion of its war with Hamas, Reuters is reporting Friday, citing Egyptian and regional sources.
""Israel wants this buffer zone between Gaza and Israel from the north to the south to prevent any Hamas or other militants from infiltrating or attacking Israel,"" the news agency quoted a senior regional security official as saying.

Three regional sources told Reuters that the idea has been mentioned by Israel to Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
Ophir Falk, the foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said to Reuters that ""a buffer zone may be part of the demilitarization process"" after the war.
Falk reportedly added that Israel wants to carry out a ""three-tier process"" of destroying Hamas, demilitarizing the Gaza Strip and then deradicalizing the area.


The Israeli Air Force has shared footage appearing to show an airstrike being carried out Friday against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.
""Fighter jets and helicopter gunships attacked terrorist infrastructures of the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanese territory in response to launches towards the territory of the State of Israel during the day,"" it wrote in a post on X.
""In addition, an Air Force aircraft attacked a firing squad in the Malkia area that attempted to fire at Israeli territory,"" the Israeli Air Force also said.
Hezbollah earlier claimed it attacked a group of Israeli soldiers near Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
Hezbollah fighters used “suitable weapons” against the Israeli troops, the terror group said in a statement. There were no reported casualties.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks to the media prior to departure from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates on Friday, Dec. 1.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that Israel is taking steps to “get people out of harm’s way” as it has resumed its military campaign against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza.  
“On the civilian protection and humanitarian assistance piece of this, that is absolutely imperative, and we saw Israel take steps immediately today, to start to get information to people about where safe areas are, how they can get out of harm’s way,” Blinken said in Dubai on the sidelines of the COP28 climate change conference, according to the Associated Press. 
Blinken said it was too early to say if Israel had fully followed through on commitments he said the Israelis had given him to ensure that any military operation in southern Gaza not produce similarly high death tolls as its earlier operations in northern Gaza, the AP also reported. 
Palestinian health officials are claiming dozens of people have already been killed Friday in Gaza as Hamas continues to hold onto hostages captured at the start of the war on Oct. 7.

A family member of two Israeli boys released from Hamas captivity this week said they were branded like cattle, among other abuses, in the weeks they were held in Gaza since Oct. 7, according to a report.
Brothers Yagil Yaakov, 12, and Or Yaakov, 16, were freed Wednesday during a temporary cease-fire that saw the release of approximately 110 hostages. Their uncle said the terrorists branded each boy by using the exhaust pipe of a motorcycle to identify them in case they escaped, the Times of Israel reported.
""They told us stories about what they went through inside Gaza. The stories are horrible,"" Yaniv Yaakov said in North Macedonia with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen. ""Each child that was taken by Hamas was taken on a motorbike, and they took every child, took his leg and put it on the exhaust of that motorbike, so they have a burn, so they will be marked if they run, if they escape, so [Hamas] can find them.""

He added, ""They were drugged, they were treated so badly, but at least they are with us.""
Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett confirmed the details of the branding on social media platform X, saying, ""We now know that Hamas terrorists who held hostage 13-year-old Yagel Yaacov and his brother Or, used a boiling hot motorcycle exhaust to ‘imprint’ a burn on their legs as a way to identify them if they try to escape.""
""Let me repeat: They took a boiling piece of metal and pinned it to the legs of a helpless 13-year-old captive child,"" he added.
When a user pressed him for evidence of the claim, he said he met with the children and saw their scars.

Israeli forces struck Lebanon's southern village of Jibbayn near the border with Israel amid tensions between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah, on November 23, 2023.

Lebanon’s Hezbollah has claimed an attack on a group of Israeli soldiers on Friday near Israel's northern border with Lebanon.

The attack is the first to be carried out by Hezbollah against Israeli troops along the border after a temporary cease-fire went into effect on Nov. 24 between Israel and Hamas, an ally of Hezbollah. The truce expired Friday morning, Dec. 1.
Hezbollah fighters used “suitable weapons” against the Israeli troops near an Israeli post known in Lebanon as Jal Allam, the terror group said in a statement. There were no reported casualties.
Israel’s military Aerial Defense Array also successfully intercepted a suspicious aerial target that crossed from Lebanon into Israel.
When the temporary truce expired on Friday, fighting continued in Gaza with Hamas firing rockets into Israel and the Israeli military 
answering the attack with airstrikes.
Hezbollah first started attacking Israeli posts along the border on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas triggered a war with Israel with a deadly surprise attack.

Family members of the American citizens still being held hostage in Gaza are urging the Red Cross to act on its imperative to deliver life-saving care immediately.
“We are outraged knowing our loved ones, including those with grave injuries, have not yet received the critically needed medical care and humanitarian aid from the Red Cross to which they are entitled under the pause agreement with Hamas,” the families said in a statement released Friday.
The families urged the Red Cross to honor its international mandate to visit civilian detainees in times of war to monitor their treatment and conditions.  

“The United States funds 25% of the Red Cross’s budget. Yet not a single American hostage has been visited to date. After 55 days of agony, we still don’t know anything about the condition of our loved ones, but we do know many of them were taken with life-threatening injuries, and they need medical attention now,” the statement continued.
“We call on the Red Cross to demand immediate, unfettered access to the nearly 150 hostages still in captivity. We urge the U.S. government and international community to use their influence and financial leverage to push the Red Cross to fulfill its role and responsibility to the hostages. And we implore donors, financial institutions, and other supporters of the Red Cross to make their voices heard on the matter and demand action to provide oversight and life-saving care to hostages immediately,” they added.

And, the families said: “We cannot wait a moment longer. While the Red Cross dithers, our family members are dying. They have lived in captivity for more than 8 weeks with grave injuries inflicted by Hamas – broken bones, limbs blown off, gunshot wounds, and more. They are malnourished and reports show they are being subjected to physical and mental torture. The Red Cross is neglecting sick, critically wounded, and disabled people at a time of greatest need. We need action now to save their lives.” 
The families are also urging major donors of the Red Cross including financial institutions like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and PayPal, to leverage their influence to call for immediate action.

Israeli authorities determined the deaths of three people who were kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attack. 
The hostages were Aria Zalmanowicz, 85, May Goren, 56, and Ronen Engel, 54. All three were from Kibbutz Nir-Oz, an Israeli border community.

Zalmanowicz was a founder of the kibbutz. He was a father of two and grandfather of five grandchildren. A news release said he was an avid reader who loved history and was ""dedicated to agriculture his entire life.""
Goren was a mother of four children, Assif, Bar, Gal and Dekel. She was a kindergarten teacher who ""gave loving care to the kibbutz children for many years."" Her husband, 56-year-old Avner Goren, was murdered in the Oct. 7th massacre.
Engel was a married father of three. He was a photographer, a volunteer for Israel's national EMS organization and a motorcycle enthusiast. His wife, Carina, and two daughters, Mika and Yuval, were abducted to Gaza on Oct. 7 and were released this week.

Democratic lawmakers are putting MSNBC on full blast over its decision to cancel far-left host Mehdi Hasan’s weekend program, questioning the timing of the move as Hasan has been vocal about his views of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
MSNBC revealed Thursday that Hasan will lose his Sunday show, as well as his program on the Peacock streaming service, but will stay at the network as an on-camera analyst and fill-in host. The move was announced as part of a broader overhaul of MSNBC's weekend programming. 
""Squad"" member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., heralded Hasan as ""one of the most brilliant and most prominent Muslim journalists in the U.S."" but expressed her concerns about his demotion. 

""It is deeply troubling that MSNBC is canceling his show amid a rampant rise of anti-Muslim bigotry and suppression of Muslim voices. Anyone who cares about free expression should be concerned,"" Omar posted on social media. 
Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., went even further, calling on MSNBC to provide a public explanation behind its programming decision. 
""It is bad optics for MSNBC to cancel @mehdirhasan's show right at a time when he is vocal for human rights in Gaza with the war ongoing,"" Khanna wrote. ""As a strong supporter of free speech, MSNBC owes the public an explanation for this decision. Why would they choose to do this now?""
Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who launched a primary bid against President Biden, also praised Hasan as being an ""important voice during his tenure at @MSNBC"" despite him still remaining with the network. 

""America is best served by platforming more perspectives, diversity of opinion, and provocative debate - not less,"" Phillips added. 
MSNBC did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Photographs released by the Israeli prime minister's office show siblings Bilal and Ayesha Alzyadna as they reunited with family members at Soroka Hospital after their release by Hamas.
The emotional reunion took place after the siblings were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israel says 110 hostages were released during the cease-fire that began last week, 86 Israelis and 24 who are foreign nationals.
In exchange, Israel freed three times as many Palestinian prisoners as part of a temporary truce with Hamas.
That cease-fire is now over after the Israel Defense Forces said Hamas violated the terms by firing a rocket into Israeli territory. Hamas claims Israel broke the truce by declining an offer to free more hostages.
Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levi said Friday that 137 hostages remain in the Gaza Strip. There are 117 males and 20 females, including children, still held captive who were kidnapped in the Oct. 7 terror attack. Ten of the remaining hostages are aged 75 or older.

Israel aims to kill the top three leaders of Hamas and will continue the war in Gaza into early 2024 at least to accomplish that goal, according to a report.
While Israel's air and ground offensive has mostly targeted the northern Gaza Strip since the Oct. 7 terror attack, the county is preparing for a long campaign to eradicate Hamas that will send Israeli forces into the south Gaza Strip, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

The military's goal is to kill Hamas' top three commanders — Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa — and secure ""a decisive"" military victory that would eliminate Hamas' 24 battalions, destroy its underground tunnel network and end the terror group's ""governing capability in Gaza,"" the report said.
“This will be a very long war . . . We’re currently not near halfway to achieving our objectives,” a source familiar told the Financial Times.

The top 
United Nations official for human rights called the end of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas ""catastrophic"" and urged the international community to press both sides for another pause. 
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a statement issued in Geneva on Friday that the situation in Gaza “is beyond crisis point” as more Palestinians risk being killed or “forcibly displaced to already severely overcrowded and unsanitary parts of Gaza.”
He said “recent comments by Israeli political and military leaders indicating that they are planning to expand and intensify the military offensive are very troubling.”
Türk said both Israel and Hamas have an ""obligation to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, throughout Gaza.”

Israeli warplanes carried out strikes in the Gaza Strip on Friday after the Israel Defense Forces intercepted a missile fired from Gaza and said Hamas broke the cease-fire.

KHIRBET ZANUTA, WEST BANK -- NOVEMBER 16, 2023: A Palestinian home sits abandoned after its inhabitants left due to repeated instances of Israeli settler violence and harassment, in the Palestinian village of Khirbet Zanuta, West Bank, Thursday, Nov. 16, 2023. (MARCUS YAM / LOS ANGELES TIMES)

The Biden administration is preparing to impose travel bans on Israeli settlers accused of carrying out attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, the Associated Press reported.
The report cited a senior U.S. official who said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war Cabinet on Thursday that the administration desires to hold settlers accountable for these attacks, but would not act unilaterally. 
Visa bans against an as-yet undetermined number of settlers could be announced as early as next week, the official said. The official spoke to reporters accompanying Blinken on his latest trip to the Middle East as he flew from Tel Aviv to Dubai.

Blinken previously raised concerns over Israeli settler violence at a news conference on Thursday after his meetings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
“We’re looking to the Israeli government to take some additional steps to really put a stop to this. And at the same time, we’re considering our own steps,” he said.
Settlers affected by the travel ban would be excluded from the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens of member countries visa-free entry into the United States for up to 90 days. Israel joined the program earlier this year.

Pakistan condemned the resumption of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Friday, accusing the Jewish state of ""war crimes"" and demanding a renewed cease-fire to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch made the comments during a weekly news conference on Friday, the Associated Press reported.
She said the temporary pause in fighting that ended Friday had given the people of Gaza a needed respite. 

“Pakistan reiterates its call for a durable and sustained cease-fire to enable supply of extensive and robust humanitarian assistance; urgent medical aid to the injured; and shelter to those who have been displaced as a result of the indiscriminate and inhumane bombing campaign by Israeli occupation forces,” she said.
Baloch said Pakistan supports a comprehensive investigation into ""attacks against medical facilities, schools, mosques, churches, residential buildings and water facilities and urges full accountability for the war crimes being perpetrated in occupied Palestine.”

The Israel Defense Forces have declared Khan Younis – a Hamas stronghold in Gaza acting as a temporary headquarters – a war zone and warned residents in the nearby areas to evacuate south toward the Rafah crossing.
The military released a map Friday that divided the Gaza Strip into hundreds of numbered parcels and asked residents to locate themselves in case of an eventual evacuation.

The parcels were crudely drawn, with lines cutting across streets in some cases. The map, which Israel said would eventually be interactive, was published hours after Israel-Hamas fighting resumed, ending a weeklong truce that had been negotiated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States.
Before the truce, the main combat zone was in northern Gaza, the focus of Israeli ground forces. Now, the Israeli military's attention appears to have shifted to southern Gaza, packed with some 2 million Palestinians, including hundreds of thousands who fled the north.
The Associated Press contributed to this update.

Hours after Israel resumed its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry said 32 people had been killed and dozens wounded. Hours later, they updated the figure to 54 dead.

Fighting between Israel and Hamas initially stopped on Nov. 24 after both sides negotiated a temporary cease-fire to exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israel. It initially lasted for four days, but was extended for several days with the help of Qatar and fellow mediator Egypt.
Qatar, which has served as mediator along with Egypt, expressed ""deep regret"" over the Israeli bombardments, saying the resumption of violence further complicates its attempts to negotiate peace.
""The State of Qatar expresses its deep regret at the resumption of the Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip following the end of the humanitarian pause, without reaching an agreement to extend it,"" the Qatari Foreign Ministry said.

""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms that negotiations between the two sides are continuing with the aim of returning to a pause. It also clarifies that the State of Qatar is committed, along with its mediation partners, to continuing the efforts that led to the humanitarian pause, and will not hesitate to do everything necessary to return to calm,"" it added.
And, ""The Ministry stresses that the continued bombing of the Gaza Strip in the first hours after the end of the pause complicates mediation efforts and exacerbates the humanitarian catastrophe in the Strip, and in this context calls on the international community to move quickly to stop the violence.""
These negotiators are continuing talks to restart the truce, according to mediator Qatar.


Israeli fighter jets struck several targets in the Gaza Strip just minutes after a weeklong truce expired on Friday morning, resuming the war with Hamas.

After more than 100 hostages were freed as part of the cease-fire and Palesitnians in Gaza experienced days of peace for the first time since a wider war broke out between Israel and Hamas, which governs the territory, black smoke billowed from the besieged territory once again.
The renewed hostilities came as Israel and Hamas have traded blame for the collapse of the cease-fire, with each saying the other side violated the terms of the truce.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu specifically said Hamas had ""not met its obligation to release all of the women hostages today and has launched rockets at Israeli citizens.""
The Israeli military’s announcement of the resumption of strikes came only 30 minutes after the cease-fire expired at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) Friday.

One airstrike destroyed a large building in Khan Younis. Another strike hit an apartment in a multi-story residential building in Hamad City. Elsewhere, a strike hit a home near Gaza City in the north, and in the refugee camp of Maghazi, near Gaza's center.

"Cruz rolls out measure to sanction Hamas, freeze Iranian assets",2023-10-30,Fox News,['Brooke Singman'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports from southern Israel. 
EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is rolling out a measure that would sanction every Hamas member known to the U.S. Treasury Department within two weeks of its passage and freeze Iran’s assets overseas, Fox News Digital has learned.
Cruz is expected to introduce the ""Hamas Sanctions Act"" on Monday afternoon, which would prohibit money from going into the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. The bill would sanction every Hamas member known to the U.S. Treasury Department within 15 days.
""The Biden administration has been indirectly and even directly funding Hamas and Hamas’s financiers in Iran,"" Cruz told Fox News Digital. ""They poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the Gaza Strip, despite knowing it would benefit Hamas terrorists.""

UN STILL DOES NOT LABEL, SANCTION HAMAS AS TERROR GROUP DESPITE MURDEROUS ATTACKS
The bill would sanction Hamas and its affiliates for using human shields, while also going after Hamas' safe havens in Qatar and Turkey. The bill would also impose sanctions on every hotel, landlord or bank that provides services to Hamas militants and its leaders.
The bill would also require President Biden to deliver a regular update on whether Qatar or Turkey qualify as state sponsors of terrorism for hosting Hamas.
Cruz said the Biden administration has ""allowed roughly $100 billion to flow to the Iranian regime by unfreezing accounts and refusing to enforce oil sanctions, which the Ayatollah passed on to Hamas.""
HAMAS ATTACK IS IRAN’S OPENING VOLLEY AGAINST ISRAEL. HERE'S HOW US MUST RESPOND
""The administration also refuses to enforce sanctions against Hamas for terrorism or for the use of human shields, or against those who provide Hamas leaders with safe haven in violation of sanctions,"" Cruz said.
Cruz’s bill would also enforce sanctions on Iran, freezing the country's assets overseas.
In September, the Biden administration made a deal with Iran to swap prisoners and release $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds.
The bill would refreeze the $6 billion, which sits in a bank account in Qatar. It would also freeze $10 billion of Iranian assets in an account in Oman.

The Biden administration maintains that the funds in Qatar have not been accessed amid criticisms from both GOP and Democrat lawmakers.
""The United States must stand with Israel in every way, for as long as it takes them to utterly eradicate Hamas, and the Hamas Sanctions Act is a necessary part of that effort,"" Cruz said.

Kirby warns to expect more civilian casualties in Gaza as Israel targets Hamas: ‘This is war’,2023-10-24,Fox News,['Anders Hagstrom'],"FOX News' Greg Palkot reports from near the Lebanon border in Israel with the latest.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby warned that more civilian casualties in Gaza should be expected as Israel continues its campaign against Hamas.
Kirby made the observation during a Tuesday press briefing at the White House, saying the casualties are an unfortunate reality of war even as Israel strictly targets Hamas positions. Hamas-run authorities in Gaza say 5,087 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since Oct. 7, though it is unclear how many of those were members of Hamas.
""This is war. It is combat. It is bloody. It is ugly, and it's going to be messy. And innocent civilians are going to be hurt going forward,"" Kirby told reporters. ""I wish I could tell you something different. I wish that that wasn't going to happen, but it is going to happen.""
""That doesn't make it right. It doesn't make it dismissible. It doesn't mean that we aren't going to still express concerns about that and do everything we can to help the Israelis do everything they can to minimize it. But that is, unfortunately, the nature of conflict,"" he added.

"‘People of Israel need our prayerful support,’ say US faith leaders from coast to coast as war continues",2023-10-10,Fox News,['Maureen Mackey'],"Israeli citizen Raz Shmilovich opens up to FOX News on the 'horrible' experience and says he fears what comes next as Hamas attacks continue.
With some 1,000 Israelis dead as of Monday evening and at least 11 Americans confirmed dead as well, faith leaders from across the U.S. shared their most solemn thoughts and deepest sympathies about the terror attacks over the weekend launched on Israel by Hamas and Islamic jihadists — and the now ongoing war. 
The fighting began on Saturday morning.
Judge Phil Ginn, president of Southern Evangelical Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina, told Fox News Digital, ""In Deuteronomy 7:6, God refers to the Jewish people when he says, ‘For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.’""
Ginn added, ""This promise is [also] contained in the same Bible as John 3:16 — and I believe that God meant both of them.""

Said Ginn further, ""He is not through with Israel. God’s purposes will be fulfilled — and the hellions of terror will not prevail in their nefarious and evil schemes and actions.""
He said that ""Southern Evangelical Seminary, along with Bible-believing Christians all over the globe, stand squarely in support of the nation of Israel in their time of need, and we call on all levels of our government to bring about the entire might of America to bear against the enemies of both Israel and the U.S.""

Patti Garibay, founder and national executive director of American Heritage Girls, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, said in a statement to Fox News Digital, ""Words cannot describe the sorrow we feel regarding the horrible, unprovoked attack by Hamas on Israel. As our brothers and sisters who share our spiritual heritage, the people of Israel need our prayerful support.""
FAITH LEADERS RESPOND TO ATTACKS ON ISRAEL: ‘WE MUST PRAY THAT THIS TERROR COMES TO AN END IMMEDIATELY
Added Garibay, who is also the author of the book ""Why Curse the Darkness When you Can Light a Candle,"" ""We stand with Israel and pray that the evil aggression that started on the Jewish feast day is divinely interrupted through the power of our Almighty God.""

Mike Signorelli, pastor of V1 Church in Brooklyn, New York, shared a prayer that people of any faith can say.
""Father, we pray right now for the peace of Israel,"" he said. 
""We also pray for the Jewish people around the world who are experiencing anxiety and fear as a result of these circumstances. We pray they would experience the comfort of your Holy Spirit.""
‘SECOND COMING OF JESUS’ IS A LIGHT FOR HUMANITY, SAYS DR. DAVID JEREMIAH: ‘GLORIOUS HOPE’
He continued, ""We ask You for protection and provision for every individual. We ask for comfort and peace for those who came out of their holiday celebration and found this news out just recently. We pray You would comfort their hearts. We pray for every family, every child and their safety.""
""We pray for every family, every child and their safety.""
He concluded, ""We ask that Your perfect will be done in the midst of these horrific circumstances. In Jesus’ name, amen.""

Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, based in Tupelo, Mississippi, said, ""We at American Family Association are heartbroken at the loss of innocent life in Israel because of the attacks by Hamas in the last few days.""

He also said, ""We are praying that Almighty God preserve the nation of Israel and its people — and we remember in prayer that Islamist groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban also oppress the many Christians who suffer under their radical ideologies.""
Jimmy Mellado, CEO of Compassion International, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, told Fox News Digital, ""Whenever war breaks out, it is the innocent, the vulnerable who pay the highest price. The impact of conflict reaches far beyond militaries and governments. It disrupts transportation, access to food, water, shelter, protection and education.""
He added, ""So today, we pray for peace and an end to conflict. Our hearts go out to the children and families living in fear as their lives are upended by war. Heavenly Father, please bring peace.""

Earlier, Rabbi Pinchas Taylor of Plantation, Florida, told Fox News Digital, ""In addition to Judaism being a religious faith, the Jewish people around the world are a family, who experience triumph and tragedy as one.""
He added, ""With Jews under attack anywhere in the world, Jews around the world feel pained and even personally more at risk. The horrific news stories coming out of Israel this past weekend are some of the darkest moments in recent Jewish history.""
""We are praying that Almighty God preserve the nation of Israel and its people."" (iStock)
He said as well, ""Hamas is an evil terrorist group that is purposefully killing civilians. Mothers. Babies. Families. Their founding charter calls for the destruction of all Jews. They embody darkness and destruction and set their vile attack this [past] weekend on what is meant to be the happiest holiday on the Jewish calendar.""
""The greatest way to personally fight darkness is by adding in light.""
Taylor, who is director of the American Faith Coalition, a nonprofit that works to advance the spiritual values shared in the Hebrew Bible, said, ""Many people are feeling powerless and confused and want to help and be involved in some way. It's crucial to remember that the greatest way to personally fight darkness is by adding in light.""

Taylor added that ""acts of unity, expressions of goodness and kindness, faith and solidarity play an important role in eradicating darkness from this world. Those who are part of the Jewish people may want to consider taking on an extra mitzvah, as doing something Jewish is not only an act of solidarity, but spiritually uplifts someone on the other side of the world.""
""Those who are not part of the Jewish people,"" he also said, ""may want to consider reaching out to someone in your life that is Jewish, and letting them know that you're thinking about them and that they're not alone.""

GOP lawmaker seeks curb on non-US flags in Congress after Tlaib office pictured with Palestinian banner,2023-10-10,Fox News,['Jessica Chasmar'],"Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has been accused of racism and anti-Semitism for a number of comments that were largely defended by liberal media outlets.
Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, is calling attention to a measure he introduced that would prevent funding for any non-American flags displayed in the halls of Congress after the office of Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was pictured with a Palestinian flag out front.
Tlaib has had the flag outside her congressional office near the Capitol since at least January, and her support of Palestinians is widely known. Amid the Hamas war against Israel that has seen at least 11 Americans dead, the Washington Examiner's Reese Gorman snapped a photo of the flag that went viral on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
The flag was still prominently displayed in front of Tlaib's office as of Tuesday morning, photos taken by Fox News Digital revealed.
 (Drew Angerer/Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/Fox News Digital)
Miller shared Gorman’s tweet and posted a screenshot of an amendment he is sponsoring.
""The halls of Congress belong to America,"" Miller wrote. ""They should be reserved for flags that embody our great nation. The Palestinian flag should not have a place here. That’s why I sponsored an appropriations amendment to end this silliness.""
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB, CRITIC OF ISRAEL, BREAKS SILENCE ON HAMAS ATTACKS AS ISRAELI DEATH TOLL CLIMBS OVER 600
Miller’s amendment to a legislative appropriations bill would prohibit funds from being used to acquire or display any flag or pennant other than the flag of the United States, any state or territory of the U.S., or the POW-MIA flag on Capitol grounds.
More than 4,500 rockets have been fired by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip toward Israel since Saturday. So far the conflict has left around 1,600 people dead on both sides, including about 900 in Israel.
The Biden administration confirmed that 11 American citizens have been killed so far in the conflict, and that it has started delivering munitions and military equipment to support Israel.
Hamas warned Monday that it would begin killing Israeli civilians held captive for every new Israeli bombing of civilian homes without warning.

In a statement, Biden said the U.S. believes it is likely that American citizens may be among those being held hostage by Hamas, but officials are working to confirm that.
Tlaib, a frequent critic of Israel, faced backlash Sunday after she issued a statement in the wake of the violence condemning the ""unconditional funding"" to support Israel, which she called an ""apartheid government.""
""I grieve the Palestinian and Israeli lives lost yesterday, today, and every day,"" she said, according to the Detroit News.

She then called for ""lifting the blockade, ending the occupation, and dismantling the apartheid system that creates the suffocating, dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance.""
Tlaib added that ""this heartbreaking cycle of violence will continue,"" so long as the U.S. ""provides billions in unconditional funding to support the apartheid government[.]""

"Israel launches 10,000th airstrike as Palestinians seek shelter in crowded southern Gaza",2023-12-04,Fox News,['Anders Hagstrom'],"FOX News' Greg Palkot reports the latest on the Israel-Hamas war.
The Israeli military said it launched its 10,000th airstrike against Hamas in the Gaza Strip late Sunday, as the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) ramps up its offensive in the south.
Israel has vowed to do everything it can to protect civilians as it targets Hamas and its network of tunnels. Many of the 10,000 airstrikes have been aimed at destroying Hamas' underground labyrinth.
Israel ordered evacuations from large sections of Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, on Monday. Critics say there are few places to evacuate to, as Southern Gaza is already crowded with Palestinians displaced during Israel's campaign against Hamas in the northern part of the strip.
The IDF says it has struck over 400 separate Hamas targets since the cease-fire agreement collapsed on Friday. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday that Hamas was to blame for the end of the cease-fire, because they did not release ""additional women and children that we know that they are holding, and they're refusing to let go.""

Israel releases unedited video of Oct 7 Hamas attack to counter ‘Holocaust denial-like phenomenon’,2023-10-23,Fox News,['Greg Norman'],"Fox News' Mike Tobin reports on gruesome terror footage
Israel released on Monday what it says is ""gruesome"" and ""unseen"" bodycam footage of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack in order to counter a ""Holocaust denial-like phenomenon evolving in real time."" 
Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy said in a video posted on X before the release that the Israel Defense Forces have ""been collecting footage from bodycams taken by the Hamas death squads,"" and that they would be making the footage public to maintain a record to counter those who doubt whether certain events took place.
""Now unfortunately, and I can't believe I'm saying this, and I can't believe that we as a country are having to do this as we work to defeat the terror organization that brutalized our people, we are witnessing a Holocaust denial-like phenomenon evolving in real time as people are casting doubt on the magnitude of the atrocities that Hamas committed against our people and, in fact, recorded in order to glorify that violence,"" he continued. 
""Therefore... the Government Press Office will screen for foreign media gruesome and as yet unseen footage of the barbarities perpetrated against our people on October 7th,"" he added. ""This is footage that has not been made public. It will screen a compilation of raw and unedited footage from the October 7th Massacre for journalists who can stomach the horrific truth and want to report on what they saw.""

At least 5,700 people have been reported killed in the war on both sides, including at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 32 Americans.

Biden refutes PBS reporter’s question on Hamas-provided Gaza death count: ‘I have no confidence’ it’s truthful,2023-10-25,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"President Biden answers a reporter's question about the accuracy of the death toll numbers released by the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. 
President Biden rejected a question posed by PBS correspondent Laura Barrón-López about the Palestinian death count provided by the terrorist group Hamas, saying he has ""no confidence"" such numbers are truthful.
During a joint press conference Wednesday alongside Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Barrón-López attempted to press Biden on whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was keeping his word of limiting civilian casualties in Israel's response to the horrific Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. 
""In the 18 days since Hamas killed 1,400 Israelis, the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed over 6,000 Palestinians, including 2,700 children,"" Barrón-López said. ""You've previously asked Netanyahu to minimize civilian casualties. Do these numbers say to you that he's ignoring that message?""

""What they say to me is I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,"" Biden responded.
Biden continued, ""I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war. I think we should be incredibly careful… Israel should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are the propagating this war against Israel. And it's against their interest when that doesn't happen. But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.""

Last week, several news organizations rushed to report claims made by the Gaza Health Ministry that Israel bombed Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital through an airstrike resulting in over 500 civilian casualties. 
Subsequent reporting and intelligence found it was an explosion in the hospital's parking lot stemming from a misfired rocket fired by Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, resulting in a death toll a fraction of what Hamas had first alleged.

The fake news prompted several Arab leaders to cancel meetings with Biden ahead of his planned trip to the region. The misreporting also led to protests and riots outside U.S. embassies across the Middle East. 
Despite being debunked by both U.S. and Israeli intelligence, some continue to promote the Hamas narrative including Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.

Kirby blames Hamas for breaking cease-fire: ‘We know they are holding’ more women and children,2023-12-03,Fox News,['Danielle Wallace'],"NSC Communications Coordinator John Kirby responds to progressive pushback against U.S. aid to Israel on ‘FOX News Sunday.’
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Sunday blamed Hamas for ending the temporary cease-fire agreement with Israel. 
In an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Kirby told host Shannon Bream that the United States believes eight or nine Americans are still held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, including one woman whose condition and whereabouts are unknown.
""We just don’t have perfect visibility,"" Kirby said. ""We’re at this literally by the hour, and we want to get that [cease-fire] put back in place so that, again, more hostages can come out."" 
""Hamas is the reason that the pause ended, because they refused to put on the list additional women and children that we know that they are holding and they’re refusing to let go,"" Kirby said. ""We are working literally by the hour to see if we can get this back on track."" 
A weeklong cease-fire that expired Friday facilitated the release of dozens of the 240 Israeli and foreign hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. But Israel has called its negotiators home and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has committed the Israel Defense Force to removing Hamas from power in Gaza.
Bream confronted Kirby with remarks from Democratic members of Congress regarding military aid to Israel, including progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., who said recently, ""What we are witnessing is the gross violation of human rights in Gaza and that is being done with U.S. military assistance.""

""What’s being done with U.S. military and security assistance is helping our friend and partner, Israel, go after a truly genocidal threat, a threat posed by Hamas,"" Kirby said in response. ""And I think it’s just too easy as we get further and further and further away from the 7th of October to forget what happened on that day: 1,200 Israeli literally slaughtered, kids in front of their parents, parents in front of their kids. And we’ve got to help Israel eliminate their threat to the Israeli nation and the Israeli people from that threat, from Hamas, and we’re going to keep doing that, absolutely."" 
Recognizing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Kirby said the Israeli forces have been ""receptive"" to messages from the United States and altered the way they’ve conducted some operations to spare civilians, even though Hamas militants are said to hide behind civilians in key infrastructure and safe zones.

Still, Kirby said, ""too many"" thousands of civilians have been killed and wounded, while 1 million people have been displaced internally in Gaza. ""We’re not blind to the humanitarian crisis, which is why we worked so hard to get that pause in place for seven days so that we could get hostages out and get an accelerated amount of food, water, medicine and fuel into Gaza,"" he said. 
ISRAEL RESUMES BOMBARDMENT OF GAZA AFTER CEASE-FIRE WITH HAMAS ENDS
Kirby reiterated how Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Israeli counterparts when he was there about the need to ""reform"" and ""revitalize"" the Palestinian Authority in a way to meet the ""aspirations and the needs of the Palestinian people."" Netanyahu has said Israel does not want to occupy or control Gaza after the conflict ends. 
John Kirby speaks during a daily news briefing at the White House on Nov. 27, 2023. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)
""We agree with them on that,"" Kirby said in response Sunday. ""We don’t want to see them occupy Gaza. We don’t think that that is a long-term strategic goal that is really achievable or wise for the Israeli people. We believe that at the core, the future of governance in Gaza has got to be something that the Palestinian people have a vote in, a voice in. That they have governance that it truly representative of them and their aspirations."" 
Kirby said Israel is a sovereign nation and denied that the U.S. was placing ""red lines"" on aid. 
Israel on Sunday ordered more evacuations in and around Gaza's second-largest city of Khan Younis, followed by heavy bombardment, as the military's offensive shifted to the southern half of the territory, where Israeli officials say Hamas leaders are hiding.

"Hamas tells NY Times it hopes war with Israel is ‘permanent,’ paper says Hamas not interested in governing",2023-11-09,Fox News,['Brian Flood'],"Israeli forces have destroyed 130 entrances to Hamas terrorist tunnels since the war began on Oct. 7, according to the Israel Defense Forces.
The Hamas terror group told The New York Times that it hopes the war with Israel will ""become permanent on all the borders"" and the Oct. 7 massacre ""succeeded in putting the Palestinian issue back on the table, and now no one in the region is experiencing calm.""
A Times report headlined, ""Behind Hamas’s Bloody Gambit to Create a ‘Permanent’ State of War,"" featured a subhead that ""Hamas leaders say they waged their Oct. 7 attack on Israel because they believed the Palestinian cause was slipping away, and that only violence could revive it.""
The terror group achieved violence, killing at least 1,400 civilians including women, children and the elderly while kidnapping hundreds of civilian hostages. Israel has responded with force, and the Times reported that ""carnage is not the regrettable outcome of a big miscalculation"" but instead a ""necessary cost of a great accomplishment — the shattering of the status quo and the opening of a new, more volatile chapter in their fight against Israel.""

The Times spoke with Khalil al-Hayya, a member of Hamas’s top leadership body, who told the paper that the terror group ""succeeded in putting the Palestinian issue back on the table, and now no one in the region is experiencing calm.""
Now, Hamas is hopeful that the entire Arab world will join them in a ""permanent"" war on the Jewish state. 
""I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us,"" Hamas media adviser Taher El-Nounou told the Times. 
The Times report added, ""The assault was so devastating that it served one of the plotters’ main objectives: It broke a longstanding tension within Hamas about the group’s identity and purpose. Was it mainly a governing body — responsible for managing day-to-day life in the blockaded Gaza Strip — or was it still fundamentally an armed force, unrelentingly committed to destroying Israel and replacing it with an Islamist Palestinian state?""
""With the attack, the group’s leaders in Gaza… answered that question. They doubled down on military confrontation,"" the Times wrote.

New York Times Istanbul bureau chief Ben Hubbard and investigative correspondent Maria Abi-Habib then wrote that the Oct. 7 attack ""stemmed from a growing sense that the Palestinian cause was being pushed aside, and that only drastic action could revive it.""
""On the surface, the months before the brutal assault seemed relatively quiet in Gaza. Hamas had sat out recent clashes between Israel and other militants, and the group’s political leaders were a thousand miles away in Qatar, negotiating to get more aid and jobs for residents of the impoverished territory,"" Hubbard and Abi-Habib wrote. 
""But the frustration was building. Hamas leaders in Gaza were flooded with images of Israeli settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank, Jews openly praying at a contested site customarily reserved for Muslims, and the Israeli police storming the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, a touchstone for Palestinian claims to the holy city. The prospect of Israel’s normalizing ties with Saudi Arabia, long a deep-pocketed patron of the Palestinian cause, appeared closer than ever,"" they continued. ""Then, on a quiet Saturday morning, Hamas attacked.""

The Times noted it was ""clear in advance that Israel would respond by bombarding Gaza, killing Palestinian civilians,"" but Hamas proceeded anyway. 
Al-Hayya told the paper, ""What could change the equation was a great act, and without a doubt, it was known that the reaction to this great act would be big"" and ""We had to tell people that the Palestinian cause would not die.""
Notably, the Times didn’t refer to Hamas as a terror group in the report, aside from one mention deep into the article that the United States and other nations have classified it as a terrorist organization.

Hamas brutality against Israeli innocents shocks the world’s conscience,2023-10-11,Fox News,['Howard Kurtz'],"FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst joined ‘MediaBuzz’ live from Southern Israel reporting on the latest news emerging from the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Hamas is beheading Israeli soldiers.
Hamas is beheading Israeli babies.
That should end the debate right there.FROM HAMAS BRUTALITY TO ISRAELI RETALIATION, THE MIDEAST IS AGAIN ENGULFED BY WAR
These mass murders are so barbaric, so medieval, so fueled by hatred, that the media are calling them out for what they are: human savagery.
It is hard to watch, hard to listen to, hard to think about during the wall-to-wall coverage. Even veteran war correspondents have been choking up, breaking down, in reporting on these atrocities. Mothers have tearfully described watching their kids seized from inside their homes. Many women have been raped.

If you want to say Israel is to blame for its treatment of Gaza – despite the fact that its forces voluntarily withdrew 18 years ago – that’s your privilege. The Jewish state has in the past used excessive force, and its retaliatory bombing will undoubtedly claim some civilian lives (though before decimating an apartment building, officials warned residents to evacuate).
But the Hamas regime has long treated its own citizens as human shields, mixing military production and organizations with ordinary people, with the added benefit that Israel can be blamed if civilians are killed.ELON MUSK: CRUSADER OR CRAZY?
By contrast, Hamas began its weekend assault by butchering 200 people at a music festival. By contrast, Israeli reports say the terrorist group killed 40 babies. By contrast, Hamas has kidnapped 150 people, many of them families with children.

These are not militants, as the New York Times and some at MSNBC insist on calling them. These are terrorists. Hamas is the new ISIS.
This is not a time for both-siderism. The bloody killings by Hamas are war crimes, and most of the world is truly sickened.

President Biden, after two days of radio silence, yesterday delivered a strong, emotional, empathetic denunciation of ""sheer evil"" and ""bloodthirstiness"" by Hamas. Viewers could see the pain etched in his face as he spoke of the casualties (including 14 Americans) and those taken hostage (which also includes Americans). But this followed two days of radio silence. Biden should be on TV every day talking about Israel and driving the news cycle. 
I am not, as a journalist, pro-Israel or anti-Palestinian. Bibi Netanyahu’s government has overreached in so many ways, including the attempt to neutralize the Supreme Court that utterly divided the country and caused waves of mass demonstrations. And the intelligence failure to detect an assault that overran small border towns that were always described as safe will go down in history. 
I have hoped for decades there could be a two-state solution. But it always seems out of reach. What we have, instead, is Israel’s 9/11.
War is ugly, as we all know. But this is not the traditional war pitting one military against another. The deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians unfortunately carries echoes of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including the mass kidnapping of children. But even the Kremlin doesn’t boast about its horrific methods.SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

Pro-Palestinian protesters blame Israel for Hamas terror attack in ‘repugnant’ demonstrations,2023-10-08,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"Hundreds turned out to demonstrate against Israel after the Hamas terrorist attack over the weekend, blaming Israel for the attack and urging the U.S. to end its ties with Israel. (Peter Gerber for Fox News Digital)
Hundreds of protesters turned out in New York City on Sunday to support the Palestinians after an attack by Hamas on Israel over the weekend.
Hamas terrorists launched thousands of missiles at Israel and invaded towns along the Gaza border on Saturday, killing at least 700 people and wounding thousands more and prompting Israel to declare war against the Iran-backed group.
The protest, organized by the Democratic Socialists of America – a group that boasts six members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including members of ""the Squad"" – took place in Times Square and then advanced down 42nd Street to Bryant Park, close to the Israeli Consulate.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned the rally ahead of its start, saying that the ""people of Israel are facing violent terrorist attacks and civilian kidnappings"" and blasting the rally as ""abhorrent and morally repugnant.""

Hundreds marched through the city’s midtown area, with many chanting, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" – a chant that the Anti-Defamation League notes can be understood as a call for the elimination of Israel. Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine often use the chant as an anti-Israel rallying cry.
The protesters carried signs that called for an end to U.S. aid to Israel and argued that ""Resistance is justified when people are occupied.""

The protest prompted a counter-protest from Israel supporters, who police separated from the pro-Palestinian protesters with barriers and roads where possible. The opposing groups lined 42nd Street as they chanted at each other, at times hurling insults and yelling directly at the other side.

Israel at War: How President Nixon saved the Jewish state with an ingenious plan,2023-10-13,Fox News,['Eric Shawn'],"Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan joins 'FOX News Live' to describe the 'unprecedented attack, atrocities' waged by Hamas on Israel.
The Biden administration is rushing munitions, an aircraft carrier battle group and warplanes to help Israel fight the Hamas terrorists who launched the devastating mass attack that has left so much horror.
The U.S. action is reminiscent of an earlier White House push that helped save the Jewish State 50 years ago.
In 1973, in the wake of the surprise Yom Kippur War launched by Arab states, President Nixon ordered a mass airlift of tanks, ammunition and equipment that is credited with making the difference for Israel to win the war. The operation even creatively sketched out a plan to send warplanes by having them hopscotch from aircraft carrier to aircraft carrier to fly across the distances needed to reach Tel Aviv to resupply the 49 Israeli jets that had been bombed by Egypt and Syria.

""50 years ago my grandfather, President Richard Nixon, ordered the Pentagon to send 'everything that can fly' to aid Israel as she came under a surprise attack in what would become the Yom Kippur War,"" notes President Nixon's grandson, Chris Cox.
""The invading Egyptian and Syrian armies were repelled in less than a month. As he proved, decisive presidential leadership matters and I hope that America's leaders come to Israel's aid in the same manner in what has become the second Yom Kippur War.""
Nixon's plan was called ""Operation Nickel Grass.""
""You get that stuff to Israel. Now. Now,"" the president was quoted as ordering.

The airlift shipped 22,395 tons of military equipment, including tanks, to Israeli forces in a matter of weeks, but perhaps the most unusual triumph was the ingenious way the administration was able to resupply Israel with warplanes.
The Europeans refused to allow U.S. fighter jets to transit their territory, except for Portugal permitting refueling in the remote Azores in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The planes, A-4 Skyhawks, took off, were refueled by tankers from USS John F. Kennedy, landed on USS Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Mediterranean, were refueled by tankers from USS Independence which was east of USS Franklin D. Roosevelt, before landing at Lod International airport in Israel, where the U.S. insignias were swapped out for IDF signs and sent into battle.
""The Yom Kippur War of 1973 was a great power conflict; the Soviet Union armed Israel's attackers then, like Iran is supporting Hamas now,"" noted Cox.

""The United States employed a tactful combination of dialogue and military strength 50 years ago and the Soviet Union backed down. One hopes that America's leaders today take lessons from my grandfather, President Richard Nixon, and send Israel 'everything that can fly.'""
""The CIA is on record that they were caught flat-footed 50 years ago in failing to anticipate the Yom Kippur War,"" says Cox. ""It remains to be seen now, 50 years later, why there was yet another intelligence failure as Hamas committed atrocities against Israeli citizens.""

The war lasted 18 days, while the airlift lasted for 32 days. According to ""AirPower Journal,"" Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir ""emotionally commented that 'for generations to come, all will be told of the miracle of the immense planes from the United States bringing in the material that meant life to our people.""
The legendary prime minister called Nixon, ""My president,"" and now, as then, the Jewish state, our closest ally in the Middle East, looks to America for help in its time of crisis.

Holocaust victims’ kin torches women’s groups’ silence on Hamas pillaging: ‘Horrendous’,2023-12-06,Fox News,['Charles Creitz'],"Daniella Greenbaum Davis, a Jewish-American columnist, calls out the 'silence' from women's organizations following the Oct. 7 atrocities in Israel on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.' 
A Jewish-American columnist who is the descendant of Holocaust victims lambasted top women's groups for their silence against documented evidence of widespread rapes, dismemberment and torture of Israeli women by Palestinian Hamas terrorists.
Daniella Greenbaum Davis told FOX News she is outraged at the silence or countervailing comments from women's rights activists and those who proclaim to be part of the #MeToo movement or other liberal causes.
In one case cited by ""The Story"" anchor Martha MacCallum, a volunteer member of Israel's October 7 Response Team appeared shellshocked at a podium as he recounted some of the horrors he and his team viewed as they recovered bodies of those murdered by Hamas.
""Her body was brutal (sic) in a way that we cannot identify her from her head to toes. She was abused in a way that we could not understand and cannot deal with,"" said Simcha Greinman in public remarks.
GRAHAM TORCHES ANTISEMITISM IN DEMOCRATIC RANKS

MacCallum reported to Davis that the World Health Organization, Planned Parenthood, the Women's March group, and EMILY's List have all said little or nothing about the abuse and murder of women by Hamas.
""I never could have imagined this. I think we talk about MeToo. We talk about ‘believe all women’. We talk about what it means to be a good feminist and support each other. And there has never been as much evidence in a case of sexual assault that we have right now with what happened on October 7th,"" Davis said, adding there is likely more abuse occurring among women still held by Hamas in Gaza.
She said there are documented accounts from groups like Greinman's of corpses with broken pelvic bones, potentially signifying rapes, and severed Achilles tendons to prevent kidnapped women from running away.
SCHUMER PRAISED ON THE RIGHT FOR CONDEMNING LEFT-WING ANTISEMITISM
""And still, we're seeing silence from U.N. Women, from the MeToo movement, from every single community of women that I would have expected would have shown up in this moment,"" said Davis, who recently returned from Israel to volunteer with the recovery.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed that sentiment on Tuesday, publicly addressing worldwide women's organizations: 
""You've heard of the rape of Israeli women – horrible atrocities, sexual mutilation – where the hell are you?"" Netanyahu said.
Later, MacCallum read a tweet from a former press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, which drew widespread scorn:
""Believe all women was always an absurd overreach. Women should be heard, claims should be investigated, but evidence is required. The same is true of the allegations out of Israel. But also, this isn't a 'believe women' scenario because no female victims have offered testimony,"" Briahna Gray wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

Davis claimed the message showed a belief that Israeli women ""aren't human"" to some detractors and that for those who deny the existence of evidence of Hamas atrocities, they are not just being reported on FOX News in right-leaning media, but by such left-wing standards as the New York Times as of late.
""I think we need to be able to … remember that on October 7, there was no act of war: Hamas broke a cease-fire, came in to innocent communities, raped women and children, kidnapped Holocaust survivors, shot parents in front of their children, shot children in front of their parents. And so now there's a war and people are dying on both sides,"" Davis said.
""And it's horrendous. And we can't lose sight of how we got here.""

Volunteer in Israel describes the nightmare from the Hamas terrorist attacks,2023-10-12,Fox News,['Breana Scheckwitz'],"Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan discusses Hamas' unprecedented attacks in Israel on 'The Story.'
Images and videos from the aftermath of the horrific attacks by Hamas over the weekend are emblems of the massacre in Israel, and one ZAKA volunteer believes they go far beyond depictions of a ""regular war.""
""The size of this was insane. The amount of bodies. Not just the bodies that got shot. Bodies that got tortured,"" Tomer Peretz, a volunteer with ZAKA, shared with Fox News Digital.
Tomer Peretz is an American artist who was visiting Israel with his two sons when hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel and shot rockets into civilian villages. The Israeli government declared war on Hamas Saturday in response to the attacks that have claimed the lives of at least 1,200 Israeli civilians and soldiers.

""I never thought in my worst nightmare that anyone could do stuff like that. You see body parts all over. Babies. Kids,"" he shares with followers in a video on his Instagram. ""What kind of animal does stuff like that?""
ZAKA protocol was to write the house number on the body bags, one of the only ways to identify some of the victims, as many of the faces were indistinguishable after the brutality. ""They cut the bodies. They burned the bodies."" 
""Some kids and some babies, lots of women, some body parts,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Some were burned, some shot in the eyes, some shot maybe 50 times, tortured.""
ZAKA volunteers told to write the house number on body bags to help identify victims of Hamas attacks 
The Israeli-born American said he wishes the world could see what he witnessed to know what is happening in Israel. ""This is not a regular war; this is a genocide. They torture the people before they kill him."" 
The search continues for bodies left in shambles by Hamas.
""Once we cleared out the bodies, we found another body in between a house that collapsed. The head was tied to a tree, the body was cut, shot and burned. I think it was a teenager, maybe 18, hard to tell. Not a young person and not an old person,"" he said.
ISRAELI MUSIC FESTIVAL SURVIVOR DESCRIBES HORROR OF HAMAS-LED ATTACK THAT LEFT 260 DEAD
The humanitarian response has been so ""loving,"" with everyone coming together to lend a hand where they can. Zaka and volunteers have received ""A lot of food, a lot of donations,"" Peretz shares. ""I keep getting hundreds of messages of people wanting to help.""

Although first seen as a ""rookie"" by seasoned volunteers and members of ZAKA, he knew the work had to be done and that there was no hiding the horror of the murders. He went into houses he was advised against entering due to the devastating scenes inside. He said no matter what emotional toll it takes, ""You just have to keep helping.""
""I want the world to see it. I will share as much as I can. Pray for Israel,"" he said in a video posted on his Instagram account.

How does Israel’s Iron Dome defense system work?,2023-10-11,Fox News,"['Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy Report']","President Biden says the U.S. stands with Israel, saying, 'There is no justification for terrorism.'
The ongoing Israeli-Hamas war witnessed a surge of hostilities over the weekend as Palestinian terrorists launched a surprise attack on Israel, which the Israeli prime minister called the deadliest offensive in 50 years. 
The attack, dubbed Operation Al Aqsa Flood by Hamas, involved over 3,000 rockets, drones and commando raids that have targeted Israeli cities, military bases and infrastructure. 
In response, the skies lit up with the action of the Iron Dome, Israel’s air defense system, neutralizing a significant number of incoming threats with a reported interception rate of 90%, according to the Israeli military.

Here's how Israel’s iron dome defense system works. (CyberGuy.com)
The creation of the Iron Dome was spurred by the need to shield Israeli civilians from the unrelenting fire of mortars and rockets, chiefly from militants in Gaza and Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. It made its interception debut in April 2011, neutralizing a Grad rocket headed for Ashkelon from Gaza. Since then, it has been a key player in Israel's defense strategy, intercepting thousands of projectiles. 
The Iron Dome operates through a sophisticated radar system that detects incoming projectiles from approximately 40 miles away, calculates their trajectories and discerns their potential threats. It is a vigilant device that springs into action, firing a launcher containing 20 interceptor missiles to intercept any rocket deemed dangerous. Remarkably, it is designed to conserve its ammunition, holding fire on projectiles heading toward uninhabited regions. 
CHINA HACKING GROUP CAUGHT SPYING ON U.S. ORGANIZATIONS 
The financial facet is as hefty as the technological one, with each intercepting missile costing around $40,000 to $50,000. As of mid-2021, Israel deployed ten of these systems, each capable of guarding a vast area, ready to respond to aerial threats in any weather condition.
Originally a solo endeavor by Israeli firms Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries, the Iron Dome was designed to shield against short-range rocket threats. The project took a collaborative turn in 2011 when the United States began financially supporting the initiative, significantly bolstering its development and deployment. This financial backing was further solidified with the U.S. Congress approving a total of $1.6 billion in funding from 2011 to 2021 and an additional $1 billion in 2022. 
GET MORE OF MY TECH TIPS & EASY VIDEO TUTORIALS WITH THE FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER - CLICK HERE
The collaboration expanded in scope with the involvement of U.S.-based Raytheon Technologies, which joined hands with Israel's RAFAEL to form a joint venture called Raytheon RAFAEL Area Protection Systems. This venture aimed to establish a production facility for the Iron Dome weapon system in the United States, marking a significant step in the co-production of Iron Dome components. 
The Iron Dome undeniably contributes to safeguarding Israeli lives from rocket attacks, providing a buffer for the Israeli government to strategize its response. Last July, Israel announced significant upgrades to the Iron Dome with the addition of AI to allow for more precision in targeting.  
BIDEN SAYS U.S. COMMITMENT TO ISRAELI 'SECURITY AND THE SAFETY OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE' IS 'UNSHAKABLE'
As of the time of writing, both sides have declared war against one another, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying, ""I tell you frankly, difficult days are still ahead of us.""

Senior Hamas official admits Israel attacks had been planned for years under guise of governing Gaza,2023-10-12,Fox News,['Danielle Wallace'],"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A senior Hamas official stated during a Russian television interview that the Israel attacks had been planned for years under the guise of governing Gaza. 
""In the past couple of years, Hamas has adopted a 'rational' approach. It did not go into any war and did not join the Islamic Jihad in its recent battle,"" senior Hamas official Ali Baraka said in an interview that aired on Russia Today TV on Oct. 8. 
The interviewer interjected, ""But all this was part of Hamas's strategy in preparing for this attack.""
""Of course,"" Baraka said, according to the translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute, a nonprofit press monitoring and analysis organization co-founded by a former Israeli military intelligence officer and an Israeli American political scientist. ""We made them think that Hamas was busy with governing Gaza, and that it wanted to focus on the 2.5 million Palestinians [in Gaza], and has abandoned the resistance altogether.""
""All the while, under the table, Hamas was preparing for this big attack,"" Baraka continued. ""The rockets of the resistance cover all of Palestine. Where would [Netanyahu] take [the Israelis who were attacked]? To Tel Aviv? We bombed Tel Aviv on the very first day of the attack. Does he want to take them to the Galilee? The northern front – with Lebanon – has opened today. The Galilee is no longer safe for the Zionist enemy. We can bomb the Galilee from inside occupied Palestine."" 
""The Israelis are known to love life. We, on the other hand, sacrifice ourselves. We consider our dead to be martyrs. The thing any Palestinian desires the most is to be martyred for the sake of Allah, defending his land,"" he continued. ""We have been preparing for this for two years. We have local factories for everything. We have rockets with ranges of 250 kilometers, 160 kilometers, 80 kilometers, 45 kilometers and 10 kilometers."" 
BLINKEN, IN ISRAEL, SAYS MORE AMERICANS KILLED, VOWS SOLIDARITY ‘ALWAYS’
Israeli intelligence has come under fire after Hamas launched what came as a surprise attack Saturday. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since declared war, launching airstrikes pulverizing Gaza and preparing for a ground operation yet to come. During the interview, Baraka said the timing and specific details were kept top secret among a handful of Hamas officials. 
""The zero hour was kept completely secret,"" he said. ""A limited number of Hamas leaders knew it. The number of people who knew about the attack and its timing could be counted on one hand.""

RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN BLAMES US FOR CREATING CONDITIONS LEADING TO ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR
""In order to keep the attack secret and successful, the different factions and our allies did not know the zero hour,"" Baraka explained. ""But after half an hour, all the Palestinian resistance factions were contacted as were our allies in Hezbollah and Iran. The Turks were also notified, and a meeting was held with them three hours later, at 9 am. We updated anyone who contacted us. Even the Russians sent a message and inquired, and they were updated about the situation and about the goals of the war.""
As of Thursday, authorities in Gaza say more than 1,400 people have died there, and Israel says hundreds of the dead inside Gaza are Hamas members. The Israeli military said more than 1,300 people, including 222 soldiers, have been killed in Israel. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has been dispatched by President Biden to Israel, said Thursday said at least 25 Americans are among the dead. Hamas militants are said to have kidnapped more than 150 people being held hostage.  
During the Oct. 8 interview, Baraka also spoke of a potential prisoner swap deal. 
""There are also Palestinian prisoners outside of Israel, in European countries,"" the Russia Today interviewer posed. ""There are also prisoners in the U.S. We want them. Of course. There are Hamas members sentenced for life in the U.S.,"" Baraka responded. ""We want them too. Of course. We demand that the U.S. free our sons from prisons. The U.S. conducts prisoner swaps. Only recently, it did one with Iran. Why wouldn't it conduct a prisoner swap with us? After all, it is participating in this war. Biden, the highest authority in the U.S., declared that he stands with Israel against Hamas and the Palestinian people. Therefore, he is a partner to this aggression, he must pay the price.""

The Biden administration brokered a $6 billion prisoner swap deal with Iran last month, but since Hamas’ attacks in Israel, even some Democrats have joined Republicans in demanding the White House rescind those funds. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday no current evidence directly linked Iran to the attacks in Israel, though admitted Tehran held ""broad complicity"" in bolstering Hamas, Hezbollah in bordering Lebanon, and other terrorist groups.

Baraka applauded Iran during the TV interview for their financial and arms support for Hamas.  
""Our allies are those that support us with weapons and money. First and foremost it is Iran that is giving us money and weapons,"" Baraka said. ""There is also Hezbollah, and the Arab and Islamic people who are standing by us. There are countries that support us politically. Even Russia sympathizes with us. Even the Russians sent us messages yesterday morning. They sympathize with us. Russia is happy that America is getting embroiled in Palestine. It alleviates the pressure on the Russians in Ukraine. One war eases the pressure in another war. So we are not alone on the battlefield.""

Israel moves closer to a ground invasion into Gaza as IDF expands operations | Live Updates from Fox News Digital,2023-10-28,Fox News,[],"incoming update…
Coverage for this event has ended.

White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said Friday that the U.S. won't draw ""red lines"" for Israel.

The U.S. is not “drawing red lines” for Israel in its war with Hamas, White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said in a Friday press briefing over the phone.
“We’re going to continue to support them” but “since the very beginning we have, and will continue to have, conversations about the manner that they are doing this.”
On Friday, Israel’s military said it was expanding ground operations in Gaza three weeks into the war.
Kirby said the U.S. is continuing its humanitarian efforts in Gaza, noting that 10 additional trucks with supplies had gotten through – for a total of 84 – but that the U.S. is aware that fuel there “is only anticipated to last a couple of days.”
He added, that the administration is ""doing everything we can possible to bring"" American citizens trapped in Gaza
 ""home and to secure their release. 
Kirby said the U.S. is still evaluating the impact of airstrikes against Iranian-backed militias and “we will not hesitate to take further actions in our own self-defense.”
The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Colleges should expect more vocal board members and less generous donors if they continue letting students force ""woke"" decisions on administrators, a former University of Pennsylvania trustee said following widespread anti-Israel rallies.
""A university is not run by the students, the university is run by the board of trustees who represent all the alumni,"" the former trustee, CSMI CEO and charter school magnate Vahan Gureghian, told Fox News. ""Presidents of these universities need to take heed before they make these woke decisions that adversely impact the reputation of these elite institutions because they have awakened the sleeping giant of donors who are now saying, ‘I'm not just going to write a check anymore and automatically give them money no matter what they say or do.’""

Several top universities, including UPenn, have drawn criticism for allowing pro-Palestinian student groups to rally and express anti-Israel sentiments. Several major donors have cut off support from the Ivy League school, and drove Gureghian and a board of advisors member to resign.
UPenn faced criticism prior to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel for hosting a ""Palestine Writes Literature Festival"" featuring speakers with a history of antisemitism despite alumni and students' appeals to cancel or condemn the event, Fox News previously reported. Gureghian, who was still a trustee at the time, was surprised the university's president, Liz Magill, let the Sept. 22 event proceed after concerns were raised.
""There's plenty of people on the board, all of whom are substantial men and women, that you could get advice and counsel from, and clearly they would give you the advice and counsel to cancel,"" he said. ""That didn't happen. She let it go on.""

But then Magill took three days to release a statement in response to Hamas' attack, which killed around 1,400 Israelis and included women and children. Gureghian felt that was too slow — particularly after her decision about the Palestine Writes event just weeks earlier — and resigned as a trustee after nearly 15 years.

Over 600 alumni, faculty, and students of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are pleading with the university’s president
 to ""prevent the propagation of slogans, messages, and hateful acts that may threaten the safety of Jewish and Israeli students"" after calls for ""intifada"" rang out at an anti-Israel protest last week.
A list of 607 people associated with the school, including a graduate of 1953, wrote a letter to MIT President Sally Kornbluth Monday citing ""deep concern, fear, and disappointment"" after chants of ""one solution, intifada revolution"" and ""from the [Jordan] river to the [Mediterranean] sea, Palestine will be free!"" rang out at a rally in support of the Hamas terrorist attacks that killed over 1,400 Israelis Oct. 7.
""While we fully support the principles of free speech and the right to peaceful assembly, it is essential that we also prioritize the safety and well-being of all members of the MIT community,"" the letter states.

The letter says in addition to the use of these derogatory messages, several attendees of the event used hateful language and messages toward Jewish and Israeli bystanders. In one case, ""a perpetrator aggressively held their bicycles as intended to harm a Jewish MIT student, stating that ‘[your] ancestors did not die in the Holocaust so they could kill Palestinians.’""
Those signing the letter include graduates with PhDs and MBAs and prestigious fellowship recipients.
The authors state that in the context of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the word intifada means the ""armed and violent Palestinian insurrection targeting Israelis, including civilians, which resulted in the killing of thousands of Israelis in the last few decades.""

Three weeks to the day after the Hamas assault on Israel, former President Donald Trump and his top rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination will showcase their solidarity with Israel as they all speak at the same event.

Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy all speak Saturday at the Republican Jewish Coalition's (RJC) annual leadership conference in Las Vegas.
The gathering is only the second time Trump, the commanding frontrunner for the GOP nomination as he makes his third straight White House run, is taking part in an event with his 2024 rivals.
""This is a Halley’s Comet-type rare event where we have all of the Republican presidential candidates together at the same event on the same day on the same stage,"" RJC CEO Matt Brooks told Fox News.

Brooks said the appearance of the major Republican presidential contenders and other major GOP leaders speaking at the three-day confab that got underway Thursday ""underscores how much they value the Jewish community.""
More than 1,400 Israelis were killed during the sneak attack. Israel responded with relentless airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, which, according to authorities in the Hamas-controlled territory, have left roughly 7,000 Palestinians dead.
Israeli military aircrafts attacked about 150 underground targets in the northern Gaza Strip over Friday night amid the ongoing war against Hamas terrorists.
The Israeli Defense Forces said Hamas terrorists were killed while underground combat zones and other underground terrorist infrastructures were also destroyed.
The IDF said the head of the Hamas air force was eliminated.
More than 8,400 people have been killed in Gaza and Israel since Hamas launched its largest attack against Israel in decades on Oct. 7, leading to retaliatory action from Israeli forces. 

Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Friday that cutting off communication to people in Gaza during the war between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists is ""unacceptable"" and endangers innocent civilians.
The congresswoman was responding to a post on X from Palestinian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Husam Zomlot, who said he has been unable to contact his family in Gaza.

""I have been trying to reach my family in Gaza for hours with no success,"" Zomlot wrote. ""All telecommunications and internet have been cut, while Israeli strikes is literally destroying Gaza from air land and sea. How many more innocent people: children, parents and grandparents will be murdered before the world steps in?""
Ocasio-Cortez replied, ""Cutting off all communication to a population of 2.2 million is unacceptable. Journalists, medical professionals, humanitarian efforts, and innocents are all endangered.""
""I do not know how such an act can be defended. The United States has historically denounced this practice,"" she added.

President Biden said in a letter to House and Senate leaders that the U.S. airstrikes against Syria on Thursday represented ""necessary and proportionate action consistent with international law"" within ""the United States' inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.""

As I have reported previously, militia groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have perpetrated a series of attacks against United States personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria,"" Biden wrote. ""Since October 17, 2023, these militia groups have conducted numerous attacks using unmanned aerial systems and indirect fire, injuring several United States service members.  A United States contractor suffered a fatal cardiac incident while moving to shelter during one of these attacks.  These attacks have placed under grave threat the lives of United States personnel and of Coalition forces operating alongside United States forces.""

""In response to this series of attacks and continuing threats of future attacks, at my direction, on the night of October 26, 2023, United States forces conducted targeted strikes against facilities in eastern Syria,"" he continued. ""The precision strikes targeted facilities used by the IRGC and IRGC-affiliated groups for command and control, munitions storage, and other purposes.  The strikes were intended to establish deterrence and were conducted in a manner to limit the risk of escalation and avoid civilian casualties.  I directed the strikes in order to protect and defend our personnel, to degrade and disrupt the ongoing series of attacks against the United States and our partners, and to deter Iran and Iran-backed militia groups from conducting or supporting further attacks on United States personnel and facilities.""

The president added, ""I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations.  The United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent with international law and in the exercise of the United States' inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action, as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.""
The military action comes against Syria comes amid the war in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas.
More than 8,400 people have been killed and thousands more wounded in Gaza and Israel since Hamas launched its largest attack against Israel in decades on Oct. 7, leading Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare war on the terrorist group.


Israel intensified its airstrikes in Gaza ahead of an imminent ground invasion as the United States continued to push for humanitarian pause to try to negotiate the release of hostages, two U.S. officials told Fox News Digital on Friday.
On Friday morning, the Israeli military’s plan was to send a division into Gaza as airstrikes intensified, but it has held off on a large-scale offensive, instead sending in a smaller force.
There is no progress on hostage negotiations with Hamas
 as of Friday but the U.S. continues to push for humanitarian pauses if hostage releases would be successful, the officials said.
They also said that Israel “has heard our concerns” about taking every attempt to mitigate civilian casualties. 
Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III also spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant in a Friday call in which they discussed Israel's operations in Gaza, according to a readout.
Austin ""underscored the importance of protecting civilians during the Israel Defense Forces’ operations and focusing on the urgency of humanitarian aid delivery for civilians in Gaza"" while stressing the importance of Hamas releasing all hostages, the readout said.

Hamas is trying to prevent people from leaving northern Gaza and is shielding itself behind civilians despite warnings from Israel to leave the area amid its airstrikes, a Palestinian activist told Fox News Digital.
""Unfortunately, sometimes we have more and more casualties among the Palestinians because of such kind of attitude and behavior of Hamas,"" Palestinian human rights activist and political analyst Bassem Eid said, accusing the group of physically restraining and blocking people from leaving.
Hamas continues to hide underneath homes and hospitals in the Gaza City, Israel alleges.
""They are physically … and trying even sometimes by force to push people back, closing the entrances of the villages or the cities or the neighborhoods over there, just standing over there and not allowing for people to move out,"" Eid said. ""So I can say that they are forcing people – they never ask people to remain in their places, but they are forcing people not to get out of their homes."" 
Israel has told residents they should be safe in southern Gaza.

Grand Central Terminal in New York City has temporarily closed due to protests inside the station, the Metro Transit Authority said just before 8 p.m. Friday.
The closure came after Pro-Palestine protesters packed the station, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.

Videos of the protests shared to social media show demonstrators wearing shirts that said “Cease fire now” and ""Not in our name"" and chanting ""Free Palestine"" while some held banners, including one that said “Palestinians should be free.”
A video from Freedomnews.tv showed an officer on a bullhorn being drowned out by cheering protesters as he told them they were ""occupying this premises unlawfully"" and that they would be arrested if they didn't disperse.
Police confirmed to Fox News Digital that arrests were made but didn't yet have the exact numbers of how many.
The protests started around 6 p.m., WABC-TV reported.
Jewish Voice for Peace confirmed on X, formerly Twitter, that it had organized the rally.

""HAPPENING NOW AT NYC'S GRAND CENTRAL STATION: THOUSANDS OF JEWS AND ALLIES HOLD AN EMERGENCY SIT-IN, DEMANDING A CEASEFIRE IN GAZA,"" a post from the group said. ""WE'RE TAKING OVER THE GRAND CONCOURSE. WE'RE REFUSING TO ALLOW A GENOCIDE BE CARRIED OUT IN OUR NAMES. CEASEFIRE NOW! NEVER AGAIN FOR ANYONE!""
The MTA said subway riders should allow extra time and take the subway to Harlem-125 St for train service.
On Friday, the UN adopted a non-binding resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza without condemning Hamas’ attacks, which the U.S. voted against and Israel rebuked it.
Israel on Friday also said it was expanding its ground activity in Gaza. 


Tulane University in New Orleans called a rally held without permission that descended into violence Thursday a ""dark day for our community.""

Three students were assaulted during the brawl that the university said involved many people who weren't affiliated with the school.
Video of the incident shows police and what appears to be school administrators trying to calm the competing crowds of protesters, who at times come to blows. The pro-Palestinian protesters also carry banners that read, ""From the River to the Sea Palestine Will Be Free,"" which many have interpreted and understood to mean a call for the end of Israel's existence as a state.
""This rally was not approved or sanctioned by Tulane,"" the statement from University President Michael A. Fitts read. ""There were approximately 40 plainclothes and uniformed New Orleans, Tulane, Loyola and State Police officers, including mounted police, who made arrests.""
He added, ""Everyone who committed an illegal act on this day will be held accountable for their actions ... Symbols and acts of hatred, anti-Semitism, deliberate provocation and preying upon the fears of others are not part of who we are.""

Israel condemned the Untied Nations’ non-binding resolution that was passed on Friday as “empty words” that refused to call out “murderous terrorists by name.”
“Today is a day that will go down in infamy,” Israeli Gilad Erdan said after the 120-14 vote with 45 abstentions.
The U.S. voted against the resolution after supporting a Canadian amendment to condemn Hamas that failed to pass.

Erdan continued, “We have all witnessed that the UN no longer holds even one ounce of legitimacy or relevance. This organization was founded in the wake of the Holocaust for the purpose of preventing atrocities, yet the spectacle we just saw proves beyond a doubt that the UN is committed, not to preventing, but ensuring, further atrocities.”
He said it the duty of the U.N. to “call out murderous terrorists by name, not hide them behind empty words! Why are you defending murderers? Why are you defending terrorists that deliberately beheaded children and abducted babies?”
The ambassador added that Israel is committed to eradicating Hamas’ capabilities for the “purpose of preventing future atrocities.”
“We all know, that if given the chance, Hamas – and Hezbollah – would commit the October 7th Massacre again, and again, and again, until there is not a single Israeli left to murder, or a single citizen to terrorize and drive away from Israel,” he added.

“And the only way to destroy Hamas, is to root them out of their tunnels and subterranean city of terror.”
He noted that the resolution doesn’t even name Hamas.
“As if this war started on its own!” he said. “Even when discussing our hostages, the drafters could not even bring themselves to name the Hamas terrorists responsible for this blatant war crime.”
Erdan added that Israel will continue to defend itself and will do “what must be done” to stop Hamas’ capabilities.
“This is a dark day for the UN and for mankind,"" he added.
In a statement on X, formerly Twitter, Eli Cohen, Israel’s foreign minister said, “We reject outright the UN General Assembly despicable call for a ceasefire. Israel intends to eliminate Hamas just as the world dealt with the Nazis and ISIS.”

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres stressed the importance of Iran’s contribution toward the “unconditional and immediate” release of hostages being held in Gaza, in a Friday meeting with Iran’s foreign minister H.E. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.

“The Secretary-General expressed to the Foreign Minister the importance of the Iranian contribution towards the unconditional and immediate release of hostages held in Gaza, and for the efforts being made to avoid a regional spill-over of the conflict and, in particular, in relation to Lebanon,” a readout of the meeting said.
On Thursday, Amir-Abdollahian accused Israel of “war crimes” and said the U.S. should stop supporting “genocide” in Gaza.
“Unfortunately this is the state of our world today,” he said. “This is the situation of the Security Council, which was supposed to try to establish world peace and security,” he said.

Friday afternoon, the UN General Assembly adopted a non-binding resolution calling for a for ""durable and sustained humanitarian truce"" in Gaza 120-14 with 45 abstentions.
The resolution didn't condemn Hamas for its unprovoked ""terrorist attacks"" that Canada had offered in a rejected amendment to the resolution. The U.S. backed the amendment and voted against the resolution.
In response to the resolution, Israel’s ambassador Gilad Erdan said, “today is a day that will go down in infamy.”
“We have all witnessed that the UN holds not even one ounce of legitimacy,” he said. “The UN is committed to ensuring further atrocity. According to the family of nations, Israel has no right to defend itself.”

The United Nations on Friday adopted a non-binding resolution 120-14 with 45 abstentions for a “humanitarian truce” in Gaza that failed to condemn Hamas for its unprovoked attacks on Israel at the start of the war.
The U.S. was among the 14 who voted against the resolution.
It was the first U.N. response since Hamas Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.
A Canadian amendment backed by the Untied States to condemn Hamas’ “terrorist attacks” was rejected before the resolution was adopted.
In response to the resolution, Israel’s ambassador Gilad Erdan said, “today is a day that will go down in infamy.”
“We have all witnessed that the UN holds not even one ounce of legitimacy,” he said. “The UN is committed to ensuring further atrocity. According to the family of nations, Israel has no right to defend itself.”


“People are very scared inside” Gaza “at this hour,” Fox News reporter Trey Yingst said in a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, live from Southern Israel late Friday local time, citing a source within Gaza.
Airstrikes could be heard and seen in the video behind him.
He added, “We do expect it to be a very active front in the hours to come.”
Earlier, Yingst called Friday night the “next phase of the war.”
“I cannot confirm a ground invasion has begun but a new phase has begun,” he reported live on air. ""This is unlike any other night we have covered.""


The war between Israel and Hamas has entered the “next phase,” Fox News reporter Trey Yingst reported from Southern Israel on Friday evening local time.
“I cannot confirm a ground invasion has begun but a new phase has begun,” he reported live on air.“
Tonight there will be Israeli forces
 inside the Gaza strip” whether or not it is a full ground invasion, he added.
He stressed, “We have not seen anything like this,” adding that Friday evening is “unlike any other night we have covered.""
He said a source inside Gaza told him that “Gaza tonight is alone” and the millions of “innocent bystanders” there feel “terrified.”
Yingst added that Israel’s military said it is increasing air strikes and continuing with plan to completely destroy Hamas. 
Mark Regev, a senior advisor to Prime Minister Netanyahu also told Fox, ""We are beefing up the pressure on Hamas. Hamas is feeling Israel's might.”


Dr. Phil McGraw strongly condemned university leaders for their tepid response to ""disturbing"" student protests after the Hamas terror attack, saying there was an ""ivy-covered intellectual rot"" on college campuses.
The no-nonsense television host began his message scolding those who were softening language in describing the Hamas terrorists.

""The Hamas invaders were not soldiers; they were assassins,"" McGraw said in a video posted by the Dr. Phil Show and TBN Israel. ""The Hamas charter calls for the ultimate annihilation of all Israeli Jews, followed by the annihilation of Jews around the world. Sound familiar?"" he remarked while photos from the Holocaust played in the background. ""Sadly, some people, including some right here in America, actually celebrated the slaughter and blame those being murdered, raped, and kidnapped,"" he said.
McGraw called out Harvard
, Yale, Georgetown, UCLA and Stanford among the dozens of other universities which he said have ""indulged"" and ""sanctioned"" protests in recent weeks. ""These student organizations' response to the Hamas attack revealed a disturbing degree of ivy-covered intellectual rot,"" he warned.
McGraw turned his ire onto university leaders who've allowed demonstrations which he claimed were ""celebrating the murder"" of Israelis.
""The leadership of these supposedly highly sophisticated schools are so busy virtue-signaling and coddling students who think that words are violence, but violence, horrific, inhumane violence, is social justice, that they have forgotten it is their job to teach their students to think and to test reality,"" he ranted.
""Instead of training tomorrow’s leaders,"" he added, ""they are profoundly demagnetizing our culture’s moral compass among the college population.""

He went on to say that ""enlightened, woke"" universities were failing miserably at educating students and training them in critical thinking.

The Israel Defense Forces said Friday the military is expanding its ground operations into Gaza. 
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the army’s spokesman, said aerial attacks had been targeting Hamas tunnels and other targets.
""In addition to the attacks that we carried out in recent days, ground forces are expanding their activity this evening,” he said. “The IDF is acting with great force ... to achieve the objectives of the war.”

Sources tell Fox News that mobile comms systems inside Gaza have collapsed entirely, rendering communications for civilians virtually impossible. A Palestinian telecom provider told the Associated Press internet service in the Gaza Strip has been cut off by Israeli bombardment.
Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reported the main internet and cell towers across Gaza are down, but some civilians are able to get signals by bouncing off Israeli towers across the border.
In the past few days, Israel has conducted
 brief ground incursions with troops and tanks to pave the way for a full-scale invasion to eradicate Hamas. Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told journalists Friday it is not a question of if, but when Israel conducts a ground operation to eliminate Hamas.  
The Israel Defense Forces said earlier Hamas terrorist targets were struck by ground troops, fighter jets and unmanned aerial vehicles over the past 24 hours. There were no injuries reported by the Israeli military and the troops were quickly out of the area.
Targets hit by the IDF include anti-tank missile launch sites, command and control centers, and Hamas operatives, according to the army.
The brief ground incursion overnight Thursday mostly impacted the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of the northern Gaza Strip, according to Fox News' Mike Tobin, and marked the second consecutive night of such operations ahead of a looming invasion.

A Hamas spokesperson stormed out of a BBC interview on Thursday when asked about how the terror group justified killing civilians in its Oct. 7 attack against Israel.

During an interview with BBC Middle East reporter Hugo Bachega, Deputy Foreign Minister for Hamas, Ghazi Hamad, insisted that his group’s attack on Israel that resulted in the murders of around 1,400 people was focused on military targets.
He claimed that there was ""no command"" to kill innocent people.
When Bachega pressed him on the fact that Hamas fighters targeted civilians during their invasion into neighborhoods in southern Israel, Hamad refused to continue with the discussion and left.
Prompting the sparring between the spokesman and BBC reporter in the now viral clip, Hamad claimed that Oct. 7’s attack ""was a military operation."" 

""It was directed for military purposes, for the military sites,"" he insisted, before Bachega cut him off, stating, ""But hundreds of civilians were killed."" 
Hamad sidestepped the interruption and pressed on, adding that Hamas’ attack was also against the ""military soldiers who imposed sanctions and collective punishment against our people.""
Again, the Hamas spokesperson said the attack was not aimed at civilians, stating, ""And I think from the first moment, we declared that this operation was not directed to the civilians. But I can confirm and assure again and again that there was no command, no command to kill any civilians.""

United Nations Secretary General António Guterres issued a dire warning about the imminent ""total collapse"" of the humanitarian situation in Gaza as Israel intensifies its bombing campaign. 
""The humanitarian system in Gaza is facing a total collapse with unimaginable consequences for more than 2 million civilians,"" Guterres said in a statement.

He lamented that only 12 aid trucks per day have been permitted to enter Gaza through the Rafah border crossing, emphasizing there is greater need for fuel, medicine and food now amid war than ever before. 
""Given the desperate and dramatic situation, the United Nations will not be able to continue to deliver inside Gaza without an immediate and fundamental shift in how aid is going in,"" Guterres said, calling for additional aid trucks to be admitted to Gaza.
""I welcome the growing global consensus for a humanitarian pause in the conflict. I repeat my call for a humanitarian ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and the delivery of life-saving supplies at the scale needed,"" he continued. 
""Misery is growing by the minute.
""Without a fundamental change, the people of Gaza will face an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering.""


Telegram, a popular social media messaging app, has shut down several accounts belonging to the terrorist group Hamas that have been used to release videos related to the Israel-Hamas war, a report said.
An account linked to Hamas' military wing
, the Qassam Brigades, which has nearly 693,000 followers, now reads, ""Unfortunately, this channel couldn’t be displayed on your device.” the same message appears when opening the page of Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obeida, the Associated Press reported.
The AP report cited a Google spokesperson who was not authorized to speak publicly to the media and spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirming the report. 
The spokesperson said Google Play’s policies require all apps that feature user-generated content to effectively moderate egregious content, including content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist attacks.
“When violations are found we take appropriate action,” the spokesperson said.
In the days immediately following the Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel, Hamas released graphic images and videos on social media boasting of the atrocities committed on more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and troops.

Projectiles hit two Egyptian Red Sea towns on Friday, injuring six people, according to reports.
Israel's military blamed an ""aerial threat"" in the Red Sea region: a possible reference to Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement which is known to use drones, Reuters reported. 
Egyptian army spokesperson Colonel Gharib Abdel-Hafez said an ""unidentified drone"" crashed into a building adjacent to a hospital injuring the six in Taba, on the border with Israel, in the early hours.

Later Friday morning, another projectile fell near an electricity plant in the town of Nuweiba, about 43 miles from the border, two Egyptian security sources told Reuters. 
No one has claimed responsibility for the incidents. 
Witnesses reported hearing explosions and seeing smoke rising plus Egyptian warplanes flying overhead, according to Reuters. 
The incidents underscore fears that the war between Israel and Hamas could erupt into a larger Middle East conflict involving terrorist groups backed by Iran.

American forces intercepted a drone attack on Al-Assad Air Base in Iraq on Friday, according to a U.S. defense official.
""Early in the morning of 27 OCT, U.S. forces engaged a one-way attack drone a few kilometers from Al-Assad Air Base, Iraq, and successfully shot it down without further incident,"" the official said. 
This is the 20th attack on U.S. troops in the Middle East since October 17th. 

The U.S. military conducted airstrikes on two facilities in eastern Syria in response to ongoing attacks against American military personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past week, according to the Department of Defense.
A pair of F-16s targeted two facilities – a weapons depot and an ammo storage area – near Abu Kamal used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin. It's unclear if there were any Iranian militants at the facilities when they were hit.
Earlier, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that U.S. strikes on Iranian proxies in Syria were targeting weapons and storage facilities.

“These strikes were in self defense,” Kirby said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" 


Several loud explosions were seen and heard in Gaza on Friday as Israel prepares for a ground invasion of the Palestinian territory. 
The blasts were observed in near the Gaza border in southern Israel, where Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reported live from the scene.

The terror group Hamas has denied Israel's allegation that its command centers exist in an underground complex beneath Gaza's largest hospital. 
A senior Hamas leader called the allegations ""baseless"" in a statement reported by the Times of Israel.

Izzat al-Rishq said, ""these lies represent a prelude to a new massacre against our people, greater than the one of the al-Ahli Baptist Hospital” — referring to the Oct. 17 blast that U.S. intelligence determined was likely caused by an Islamic Jihad rocket misfiring. Hamas has blamed Israel for the explosion and accused the Jewish state of committing war crimes against the Palestinian people.

The IDF said earlier that Hamas has hidden its main base of terror operations within a complex network of underground tunnels connecting hospitals and other civilian structures in Gaza. 
“Over 40,000 have sought refuge in Al-Shifa hospital, as they were displaced by the bombing that hit everything,” al-Rishq said. “We call on the leaders of Arab and Muslim countries to take action and stop the genocide against our people.""


IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari briefed international reporters Friday and said Hamas has placed its main base of terror operations beneath the largest hospital in Gaza.

Hagari said Shifa Hospital, which has over 1,500 beds and 4,000 staff, houses an ""underground terror complex"" used by the Islamist group to plan attacks on Israel. He referred to Israeli intelligence reports that Hamas uses an expansive network of tunnels connecting hospitals in Gaza from which to plan and launch rocket attacks targeting residential areas in Israel. He said that terrorists do not need to enter the hospital from outside to reach the tunnels, but there is an entrance to the underground complex inside the hospital wards. 
“We have concrete evidence that hundreds of terrorists flooded into the hospital to hide there after the massacres of October 7,"" Hagari said. 
According to IDF, Hamas' internal security has a command center inside Shifa Hospital, where the terrorist group stores weapons. 

“Hamas uses Shifa hospital as a shield for Hamas terror infrastructure,” Hagari said. “Hamas wages war from hospitals. By operating from these hospitals, Hamas not only endangers the lives of Israeli civilians; but also exploits innocent Gazan civilians.
Hagari shared an animated illustration showing the Hamas infrastructure beneath the hospital, based on Israeli intelligence. He told reporters Israel will not share the intelligence used to create the illustration, which has been shared with Israeli allies. 
""“Hamas terrorists operate inside hospitals precisely because they know that the IDF distinguishes between terrorists and civilians,"" Hagari said. 
“When medical facilities are used for terror purposes, they are liable to lose their protection from attack in accordance with international law,"" he added.

I’ll always stand for what’s right but to see people I’ve always identified with ripping down posters of hostages & say such horrific & uninformed things that truly resemble antisemitic tropes is very troubling to me & so many. I stand with all those who want to protect innocent Palestinians."" 
""Why can’t that same attitude be expressed for Jews?"" he asked. 
Gad was responding to a post from activist Charlotte Clymer on how the left's response to the war has been a major miscalculation. 

""It's been rather astonishing to watch just how badly much of the far-left is miscalculating this moment,"" Clymer wrote. ""It has never been more clear how many of them are firmly ensconced in echo chambers, and it is doing them no favors. Quite the opposite.""
This is not the first time that Gad, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, has spoken out about the conflict between Israel and Gaza. Lieba Nesis, entertainment writer for The Jewish Voice, told Fox News Digital in an interview that Gad has previously ""felt the need to correct himself"" for his initial reaction expressing sympathy for Israel, writing on social media he was ""personally attacked, shamed, unfollowed and threatened"" and reiterated his long-standing criticism of the Israeli government's ""occupation and their attacks on innocent Gazans.""

Newly-minted House Speaker Mike Johnson told FOX News in his first television interview since gaining the gavel that the U.S. stands firmly behind Israel, while back at home, lawmakers and the Biden administration alike must find common ground and acknowledge ""God is not done"" with America yet.

Johnson told ""Hannity"" the House is primed to proffer a $14.5 billion support bill for Israel, slightly more than what the Louisiana Republican said Israel – via the White House – has asked for.
However, a key difference between the House appropriation and other federal support is that the money will come in exchange for ""pay-for's"" in the budget, rather than simply printing the money.
Johnson said the figure is a ""very specific number tied to very specific measures"" and that each dollar should be offset by a cut elsewhere.
In terms of potential U.S. military involvement in Israel's fight for survival against Iran-backed Hamas, Johnson said he is hopeful to avert a boots-on-the-ground situation, but added that during a White House meeting Thursday he reminded President Biden's staff that they have limited ability to directly respond without congressional approval.

The Founding Fathers, he said, envisioned a ""multitude of wise counsel"" in such matters, which he noted is why Congress has the power to declare war, not the executive branch.
Johnson added that he has met previously with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and agreed that while Americans talk of ""existential threats"" stateside, Israel faces one or more daily.
""Their neighbors want to eliminate them,"" he said.
""America will back [Netanyahu] up – they tell us when we're in Israel the reason we're able to sustain ourselves and survive is because everybody knows our big ally is America.""


White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday that the U.S. strikes on Iranian proxies in Syria were targeting weapons and storage facilities. 
“These strikes were in self defense,” Kirby said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" 

Hours earlier, the U.S. military conducted airstrikes on two facilities in eastern Syria in response to ongoing attacks against American military personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past week, according to the Department of Defense.
A pair of F-16s targeted two facilities – a weapons depot and an ammo storage area – near Abu Kamal used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin. It's unclear if there were any Iranian militants at the facilities when they were hit.
Asked if Iran will retaliate, Kirby said, “It’s not uncommon for them to strike back. If they do, we’ll absolutely do what we have to do to protect our troops and our facilities.""
""We’ll be ready for that,” he added.

Local authorities identified the driver of the Volkswagen-made vehicle as 47-year-old Hani Saleh of Elmsford, New York. (White Plains Police Department)

A man was illegally carrying a handgun after he drove through the streets of a New York town in a car covered in swastikas, a Palestinian flag and pro-Hamas messages just blocks from a planned pro-Israel rally, officials said.
Hani Saleh, 47, was arrested Wednesday in White Plains at South Lexington Avenue and Quarropas Street after cops pulled over his Volkswagen, according to the White Plains Police Department 
The vehicle sported a Palestinian flag along the top, according to photos obtained by Fox News Digital.

""The license plate on the vehicle had been apparently illegally altered, and the vehicle also had writing painted across the entire windshield obstructing the driver's view,"" White Plains Police Capt. James Spencer said in a statement shared with Fox.
Police said an investigation revealed the license plate, which appears to say ""MMORTAL,"" to be a forged instrument. A weapon was also found inside the vehicle, along with other license plates, cops said.
""An inventory subject to the vehicle being impounded revealed a .40-caliber handgun and several Arizona license plates along with a New York license plate,"" Spencer said. ""Saleh was booked and processed for criminal possession of a forged instrument … and criminal possession of a weapon.""
Spencer noted that Saleh, listed as a resident of Elmsford, New York, was also issued a traffic summons for the violations.

Saleh, after being stopped by police, was arrested two blocks away from the site of a pro-Israel rally slated to take place later that evening.

A Hamas rocket struck a residential building in Tel Aviv, injuring three civilians as Hamas terrorists continue to fire at major Israeli population centers. 
Sirens blared in Tel Aviv on Friday morning to signal incoming rocket fire on the 21st day of the Israel-Hamas war. Hamas has launched thousands of rockets at Israel since the start of the war on Oct. 7, intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure.
Israel has responded by hammering the Gaza Strip with airstrikes and conducting brief ground incursions to pave the way for a future full-scale invasion. Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told journalists Friday it is not a question of if, but when Israel conducts a ground operation to eliminate Hamas.  
Israeli raids overnight by land and sea targeted tunnel infrastructure beneath the Gaza Strip as the number of hostages held captive by Hamas has risen to 229 people. 
The rescue of hostages and destruction of Hamas military capabilities are among the main mission objectives for the Israeli military, Gallant said. 
Fox News' Trey Yingst contributed to this update.


Overnight, an Israel Defense Forces raid struck a compound use by Hamas' naval forces, the military said. 
""IDF soldiers of Flotilla 13 conducted a targeted raid from the sea in the southern Gaza Strip. During the activity, the soldiers struck Hamas military infrastructure and operated in a compound used by Hamas' commando naval forces,"" the IDF said. 

The soldiers were assisted by Israeli Navy vessels and aircraft. IDF forces exited the area after the raid was carried out.
Hamas terrorists in a statement claimed to have repelled the Israeli raid from the sea.
IDF earlier said it killed the commander of Hamas' West Khan Younis Battalion, Madhat Mubasher, in an overnight airstrike in the Gaza Strip. Mubasher ""took part in sniper attacks and was responsible for large explosive devices [used] against IDF forces and Israeli towns,"" according to the military. 
Separately, IDF said it carried out more than 250 airstrikes against Hamas targets in the past day.

The legacy media’s widely panned coverage of last week's Gaza hospital explosion
 raised eyebrows across the globe and resulted in multiple corrections and editor’s notes. National Center for Audio and Video Forensics founder David Notowitz, who sniffs out deceptive and misleading evidence for a living, was among the many who were stunned anyone allowed the Hamas-backed Gaza Health Ministry to set the initial framing of the story. 
Notowitz believes the media backlash could have been avoided if journalists simply followed the common-sense methods he uses when determining the trustworthiness of evidence and sources.
""Hamas is not a reliable news source, ever. Now, you should be skeptical of anything they give you. It might be real, but you should be skeptical. Skeptical of any videos, any stills, any news they give you. It could be accurate, but check your sources and check other sources other than them,"" Notowitz told Fox News Digital. 

""A missile was shot off from Gaza intending to reach Jews. It misfired, landed in a parking lot in the Gaza hospital. Immediately, Hamas Health Ministry announced it was the fault of the IDF. And immediately, The New York Times, Reuters, BBC, they all swallowed it. They didn't even look into it,"" Notowitz added. ""They didn't try to get other opinions… way too quick on them for doing that.""

A Hamas official said Friday that the Palestinian terrorist group cannot release the hostages it has captured during its war with Israel until a ceasefire deal is reached, a report says. 

The Russian newspaper Kommersant quoted Abu Hamid – a member of a Hamas delegation visiting Moscow – as saying that Hamas needs to locate where Palestinian factions have taken the hostages inside the Gaza Strip, according to Reuters. 
""They seized dozens of people, most of them civilians, and we need time to find them in the Gaza Strip and then release them,"" Hamid reportedly said, noting that a calm environment was needed to do so. 
The development comes as the number of hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists has risen to 229, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari said Friday. 
Friday's number is five more than the 224 hostages reported on Thursday, and the number is likely to change as various operations continue to unfold, Hagari said. 

Since Hamas began taking hostages during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, only four have been released from custody – a mother-daughter duo from the Chicago area and two elderly Israeli women. 
Fox News Digital's Greg Norman contributed to this update.


The U.S. on Friday lobbed additional 
sanctions against the Palestinian terror group Hamas after the Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel, which started a war.
The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement the measures targeted additional assets in a Hamas investment portfolio and people facilitating sanctions evasion by Hamas-affiliated companies, including a Hamas official in Iran and members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 
A Gaza-based entity that Treasury said has served as a conduit for illicit Iranian funds to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was also targeted, the department said. Iran backs Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East.

""Hamas has built their own illicit networks for terror by taking many of the same steps the Kremlin is taking to avoid our financial sanctions. And much like many Russian elites, senior Hamas officials often live in luxury, while the average Gazan faces dire living conditions,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wall Adeyemo said in a speech Friday announcing the sanctions. 
""Almost immediately after its horrific attacks, Hamas solicited donations to fund its continued terrorist activities,"" he said. ""Our goal is to cut off those financial resources, while ensuring humanitarian aid can continue to flow to the Palestinian people in Gaza.""

Rep. Daniel Goldman, D-N.Y., meets with Avichai Brodutch in Washington, D.C. (Daniel Sachs Goldman and Avichai Brodutch)

Qatari Ambassador to the U.S. Meshal bin Hamad al Thani met with an Israeli man whose wife and three children are currently held captive by Hamas in Gaza, Fox News has confirmed. 
The ambassador met with Avichai Brodutch, a member of Kibbutz Kfar Gaza, whose wife Hagar and three children, Ofri, 10, Yuval, 8, and Uria, 4, were kidnapped in the Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel. 
Brodach thanked the ambassador for Qatar's mediation efforts to free hostages held in Gaza. This is the first official meeting of a senior Qatari representative with an Israel family since the outbreak of the war. 

""As a parent, a father of three children held by Hamas in Gaza, I hope Qatar will continue its efforts to immediately return home my wife and three children, and the more than 30 children held hostage by Hamas,"" Brodutch said. 
IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari revealed earlier there are 224 hostages in Hamas' custody as of Thursday morning, and all families have been notified.

Israel's military has vowed to ""reveal evidence"" that Hamas terrorists are exploiting civilian locations to carry out attacks, an official said.

Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), said during a press briefing Friday morning that Israel continued its offensive activity ""from the land, air and sea last night with an emphasis on the Shejaiya neighborhood, which is one of the major terrorist strongholds of Hamas."" The IDF killed Hamas operatives and destroyed rocket launch sites, he said.
""In the coming hours we will reveal evidence that shows Hamas's use of humanitarian facilities for terrorist infrastructures in a way that endangers the citizens of Gaza"" he added. ""I repeat, we will expose these materials that connect Hamas to the cynical use it makes of humanitarian facilities.""
Hagari also updated the number of deceased IDF soldiers to 310 and the number of hostages to 229. ""We continue to put in the most effort – the civilian effort, the operational effort, the intelligence effort to do one thing – bringing the hostages home is the highest priority,"" he said.

Hagari added, ""Hamas prefers, at any point in time, to endanger the residents of the Gaza Strip in order to protect terrorists. At every point, he prefers to get food, electricity and medical equipment to Hamas terrorists than to the citizens of Gaza who are not involved in the war. We will expose these evidence and bring them to the attention of the world and the public.""

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant says the ground invasion of Gaza is ""close"" and that the world should prepare for a lengthy battle to eradicate Hamas in the Palestinian territory.
""It's not a question of weeks, but a question of months,"" Gallant told Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst on Friday. 
Israel has amassed hundreds of thousands of troops along the border with Gaza and launched several small-scale ground incursions to hit terrorist targets. But a full-scale invasion to eradicate Hamas, promised after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in which 1,400 Israelis were brutally murdered, has so far not come to fruition. 

Gallant said he cannot give a precise date for the start of the operation, but plans are underway for the Israelis to enter Gaza and destroy Hamas and its governing capabilities. The army's mission is to return some 229 hostages to their families, secure Israel's southern area and deter Israel's adversaries in the region from joining the war.
""I'm the son of holocaust survivors,"" Gallant said. ""I'm not going to let it happen again.""

A top British government minister who represented the U.K. at the U.N. Security Council this week says he is seeing positive signs at the international body amid efforts to find common ground on ways to resolve the crisis that erupted from the Hamas terror attack on Israel.
""The U.N. is an opportunity, a place where you expose difference in order to try to find solutions. So you shouldn't walk in expecting to find unanimity, you should walk in expecting to find difference so that you can find areas of common ground that you work on,"" Tom Tugendhat, the U.K. Minister of State for Security, told Fox News Digital in an interview.

Tugendhat took the U.K. chair for the Security Council for a meeting on the situation in the Middle East, and used it to express British support for its ally Israel.
""The U.K. stands resolutely with Israel in defending itself against terror,"" he told the Council. ""We are clear that it must act in line with international humanitarian law and take every possible step to avoid harming civilians. We have given that message to Israel as a friend and ally, and we restate that position in this Council.""
Tugendhat told Fox News Digital after the meeting that there were two clear messages that emerged from the gathering and his discussions with other governments' officials.

""The first is Israel's right to self-defense,"" he said. ""It is simply unacceptable that the state of Israel should have to be there to get murdered by Palestinian terrorists, Hamas, every few weeks, months or years. That's clearly unacceptable. The second thing is that the Palestinian people should not suffer for the fact that Hamas has occupied and controlled that territory for… 30 or so years and therefore, finding ways in which we can get aid in through the Rafah crossing and support Palestinian civilians is incredibly important.""
""Is that the answer to all it? No, but that is a good place to start building on the direction of travel,"" he said.

An emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the Israel-Hamas war will resume Friday morning, with about 100 speakers remaining.

“Stop the bombs and save lives!” the Palestinian ambassador demanded Thursday at the U.N. meeting as Israel continued to pound Gaza with airstrikes. However, the Israeli envoy declared again, ""We will not rest until Hamas is obliterated."" 
The war sparked by Gaza’s Hamas rulers’ surprise attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 played out in the vast hall of the 193-nation General Assembly, where Arab nations expected to adopt a resolution Friday calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza after the Security Council’s four failed attempts to agree on any action.
At the assembly’s resumed emergency special session, speaker after speaker backed the Arab resolution’s cease-fire call — except for Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan, who told the 193-member world body, “A cease-fire means giving Hamas time to rearm itself, so they can massacre us again.”

The non-binding Arab resolution will get a vote Friday afternoon. It calls for an immediate cease-fire and demands that all parties respect international law and protect civilians.

The U.S. military conducted airstrikes on two facilities in eastern Syria on Thursday in response to ongoing attacks against American military personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past week, according to the Department of Defense.
A pair of F-16s targeted two facilities – a weapons depot and an ammo storage area – near Abu Kamal used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin. It's unclear if there were any Iranian militants at the facilities when they were hit.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Thursday night that the U.S. does not seek conflict, but the ""Iranian-backed attacks"" on American forces are ""unacceptable and must stop.""

""Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them,"" Austin said. ""If attacks by Iran’s proxies against U.S. forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people.""
There have been 19 attacks against American personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17, including three additional attacks on Thursday, according to Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder. 
A U.S. contractor died from a cardiac incident while sheltering in place during the attacks and 21 American troops were injured – all of whom have since returned to duty, Austin said.


Israel Defense Forces said an airstrike killed Madhath Mubashar, the commander of Hamas' Western Khan Yunis battalion.

Mubasher is accused of taking part in explosives and sniper attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilian communities.
""Furthermore, the IDF struck 250+ Hamas targets including a terrorist tunnel network in Gaza that detonated the secondary explosions,"" the IDF said.
Earlier, IDF said they eliminated a top Hamas intelligence official in an airstrike in Gaza on Thursday.
Israel identified the official as Shadi Barud, deputy head of Hamas' Intelligence Directorate. He is one of several senior Hamas officials to be killed in Gaza in recent days.

""Shadi Barud, Deputy Head of Hamas’ Intelligence Directorate has been eliminated by an IDF aerial strike,"" the Israeli military wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. ""He took part in the planning of the October 7 massacre and countless other deadly attacks carried out against Israelis.""
""We will continue to strike and eliminate Hamas leaders and operatives responsible for the barbaric attacks,"" it added.


Fighter jets hit more than 250 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, according to Israel Defense Forces Thursday morning.

The IDF said it struck Hamas infrastructure, operational command centers, tunnel shafts and rocket launchers ""placed in the heart of civilian areas"" that have fired toward Israeli territory since the terrorist group launched its attack on Oct. 7.
In addition to the airstrikes, the Israeli navy also took down a Hamas surface-to-air missile launch post in the Khan Yunis area.""The post is located adjacent to a mosque and kindergarten, which is further proof that Hamas deliberately uses civilian sites for terror purposes,"" the IDF said.
IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari also revealed there are 224 hostages in Hamas' custody as of Thursday morning, and all families have been notified.
""The effort to release the hostages is still a high priority in any possible way,"" Hagari said.
Fox News' Yael Rotem-Kuriel contributed to this report.


Israel launched a second brief incursion into Gaza overnight Thursday, Fox News correspondents reported from Tel Aviv Friday morning.
The Israel Defense Forces said Hamas terrorist targets were struck by ground troops, fighter jets and unmanned aerial vehicles over the past 24 hours. There were no injuries reported by the Israeli military and the troops were quickly out of the area.
Targets hit by the IDF include anti-tank missile launch sites, command and control centers, and Hamas operatives, according to the force.

The brief ground incursion mostly impacted the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of the northern Gaza Strip, according to Fox News' Mike Tobin, and marked the second consecutive night of such operations ahead of a looming invasion.
“I think preparation of the battlefield is the precise word to use there. That’s what we are getting from the Israelis,” Tobin reported from Tel Aviv at 10 a.m. Friday.

U.S. military forces are maneuvering ships throughout the Middle East to amass one of the largest collections of war ships in the region in decades, according to reports.

Making its way halfway across the Atlantic Ocean, the USS Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group is moving toward a group of U.S. naval ships in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. Once there, it will make its way through the Suez Canal to the Persian Gulf.
The fleet consists of the USS Gravely and USS Mason, both destroyers, and the USS Philippine Sea, a guided-missile cruiser.
The strike group was first tasked to join the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group in the Eastern Mediterranean, but it has since been issued the change of plans.
Once the fleet reaches the Persian Gulf, it will mark the first time since the evacuation of Afghanistan that a U.S. carrier strike group will operate in the Middle East.
U.S. Naval Institute (USNI) News reported that France is also sending an amphibious warship to join U.S. and U.K. forces as a deterrence to keep the war between Israel and Gaza from spreading to other parts of the region.

On Tuesday, U.S. Department of Defense spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed that the New Jersey Air National Guard's 119th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron arrived within U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, adding additional F-16 fighting Falcon Squadrons into the mix to deter further aggression in the region.
The U.S. Navy announced last week it would be sending the USS Mount Whitney to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea as tensions in the Middle East rise amid the Israel-Hamas war. The ship left Gaeta, Italy last week to join the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group.
Also in the area is a special operations capable Marine rapid response force of nearly 2,000 Marines and sailors known as the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which is moving closer to Israel via the Red Sea. The group includes the amphibious ready groups USS Bataan and USS Carter Hall.

"Tulane University condemns violence at dueling Palestinian, Israel protests: ‘a dark day for our community’",2023-10-27,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"Video shows a fight breaking out between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students at Tulane University in New Orleans. (Ryan Zamos)
Tulane University has denounced a rally that was held without the school’s permission or approval and developed into a serious brawl that ended with three students being assaulted. 
Video of the incident shows police and what appears to be school administrators trying to calm the competing crowds of protesters, who at times come to blows. The pro-Palestinian protesters also carry banners that read, ""From the River to the Sea Palestine Will Be Free,"" which many have interpreted and understood to mean a call for the end of Israel's existence as a state.
""This rally was not approved or sanctioned by Tulane,"" the statement from University President Michael A. Fitts read. ""There were approximately 40 plainclothes and uniformed New Orleans, Tulane, Loyola and State Police officers, including mounted police, who made arrests.""
Fitts called the protest ""deeply distressing"" as the protest ""intentionally"" took place on a public sidewalk outside the university, over which the school has no jurisdiction. He also insisted that ""many"" of the protesters at the rally were not affiliated with Tulane. 
""Everyone who committed an illegal act on this day will be held accountable for their actions,"" Fitts promised.
COLLEGE STUDENTS SAY THEY DO NOT FEEL SAFE ON CAMPUS AMID PROTESTING
""Tulane has always found strength in our unity,"" he continued. ""We must now lean on our common humanity and the Tulane spirit to find a path forward during these challenging times. Symbols and acts of hatred, anti-Semitism, deliberate provocation and preying upon the fears of others are not part of who we are.""

The university also arrested a suspect in connection with anti-Semitic vandalism to a building near the campus, and the school expects that more arrests could occur as a result of an investigation into the protest, which includes a review of video evidence.

Fitts insisted that the campus itself remains secure – a growing concern over the past two weeks as universities across the country continue to see massive demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people mixed in with antisemitic incidents. 
""To be clear: We condemn and are outraged by today’s violence and the hateful language and rhetoric we heard,"" Fitts wrote, noting that the protests had started peacefully before devolving into ""a dark day for our community.""

Two Republican lawmakers are moving to introduce legislation that would prohibit the U.S. from accepting potential Palestinian refugees displaced by the conflict in Israel.
Reps. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., and Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., will introduce the Guaranteeing Aggressors Zero Admission Act, or the GAZA Act, which aims to prevent the Biden administration from granting visas to holders of Palestinian passports, according to a report from the New York Post Saturday.
""We can’t let President Biden abuse our parole and visa rules to bring unvetted Palestinians into American communities the way he did with thousands of unvetted Afghans,"" Tiffany said of the legislation in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

The bill would also prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from allowing Palestinians into the country through its parole program.
According to the report, experts believe that there could be more than a million Palestinian refugees from Israel's bombardment of Gaza.
""I introduced the GAZA Act to protect America’s national security,"" Tiffany said.
The bill comes at the same time as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., announced his intention to introduce legislation aimed at forcing the Biden administration to cancel visas for foreign nationals who ""endorse or espouse terrorist activity.""

Biden tries to hide away in Nantucket but can’t escape pro-Palestinian protesters,2023-11-25,Fox News,['Peter Aitken'],"FOX News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson describes growing criticism over President Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, on 'Special Report.'
President Biden retreated to Nantucket, where he normally finds reprieve from the demands of running the country, but pro-Palestinian protesters managed to track him down and remain a reminder of the troubles waiting for him. 
The protesters found Biden twice on Friday, once as he departed lunch with his family and again when they attended a tree-lighting ceremony. Each time, they shouted now-familiar slogans, including ""Free Palestine"" and ""Biden, Biden, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide!""
If the president heard them, he didn’t let them know: Biden focused on greeting members of the children’s choir who performed at the tree lighting. A local official tried to dissuade the protesters from interrupting the ceremony, stressing that it was not a political event. 
Biden’s staunch support for Israel has come at a price as his party finds itself divided over the war in the Gaza Strip. His polling numbers have slumped as younger voters and members of his party stand in favor of the Palestinian people, who have died by the thousands during Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza.

""The gap is gone,"" Kornacki said. ""36% positive on both and actually Biden, one point more negative than Trump. That’s been a significant advantage for Biden, our poll says that advantage, at least for now, may be gone.""

Sen. Blackburn concerned over Biden supplemental request to aid Gaza after Hamas reportedly stole aid,2023-10-21,Fox News,['Jamie Joseph'],"Israel is expected to launch a ground invasion into Gaza after Hamas terror attacks.
Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., is concerned President Joe Biden's supplemental request to Congress, which includes humanitarian aid for Gaza, will further fund terrorism in the region. 
""Even last week, we got a report that Hamas was intersecting aid that was going and whether it is money, food, fuel even first aid kits and medical supplies — they're taking it all and it is not even Gazans,"" Blackburn told Fox News Digital in an interview Friday. ""So, we've got to move to a position where humanitarian aid is going to make it to people that are suffering, and not terrorists.""
Last week, the United Nations agency that delivers aid to Palestinians, announced Hamas leaders in Gaza had stolen medical supplies and fuel that was meant for civilians. They later deleted the post on X and claimed nothing had been stolen.

In Biden's $105 billion emergency supplemental request, he outlined $9 billion for Ukraine, Gaza and Israel.
""The majority of the American people support Israel, and they want to make certain that aid is going to make it to people who need that aid,"" Blackburn said. ""You now have this progressive group that conducts themselves as if they are Hamas sympathizers, and that is incredibly disappointing to see.""
Blackburn's jab was aimed at progressive ""Squad"" members like Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ilhan Omar who have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and oppose more funding for Israel's military.

Blackburn — who has been a leading lawmaker in calling on the administration to freeze the $6 billion in Iranian assets — was part of a group of GOP lawmakers who penned a letter to Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. on Friday calling for the supplemental request to be split up in separate packages.

""These are two separate conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to Israel in attempt to get additional aid for Ukraine across the finish line. Furthermore, it would be irresponsible and we should not risk a government shutdown by bundling these priorities together and thus complicating the process and lessening the likelihood of a funding package,"" the lawmakers wrote. 
Congress will have to convene next week to begun negotiations on the supplemental request and pass a final package and send it for final approval to the White House.

Israeli TV footage appears to show Gaza hospital blast came from Palestinian rocket,2023-10-18,Fox News,['Anders Hagstrom'],"Keshet 12 News anchor Yonit Levi describes the moment a news camera captures a rocket launched from Gaza hitting the al-Ahli Hospital. (Keshet News 12)
Israeli media shared footage from their own cameras that appears to show at least one rocket fired from Palestinians in Gaza falling short and landing on a hospital in their own territory.
The footage, shared by Keshet 12 News, clearly shows multiple rockets launching toward Israel on Tuesday. Moments later, a blast is seen in Gaza midway along the rockets' trajectory.
""This is proof of Israel's claims that it was actually missiles from the Gaza Strip that shot into the direction of the Alahali Hospital in Gaza City and not from Israel,"" Keshet 12 anchor Yonit Levi says of the footage.
""This is Channel 12's camera. It is a camera situated in the city of Netivot, and its view is of the Gaza Strip,"" she continues. ""You can see the rockets… fired over the hospital…  and you can see the blast. So that is proof of the fact that it came from the Gaza Strip.""
HUNDREDS KILLED IN BLAST AT GAZA STRIP HOSPITAL; ISRAEL SAYS ISLAMIC JIHAD'S 'FAILED ROCKET LAUNCH' TO BLAME
Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza have fired thousands of rockets into Israel since their Oct. 7 attack. 
The footage comes after Hamas claimed Israel hit the hospital and killed 500 people with an airstrike Tuesday night. Israel immediately rebutted the claims, and President Biden has said that data from the Pentagon supports Israel's assertion that the blast originated from fire in Gaza. Israel believes the rocket was fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a State Department designated foreign terrorist organization.

CNN host clashes with ‘Squad’ Democrat over Hamas’ use of sexual violence: ‘You turned it back to Israel’,2023-12-03,Fox News,['Hanna Panreck'],"Rep. Pramila Jayapal clashed with CNN host Dana Bash on Sunday after she questioned why progressive women have been hesitant to speak out against Hamas' use of sexual violence in their attacks against Israel.
CNN host Dana Bash clashed with progressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., over the lack of widespread condemnation of Hamas' use of sexual violence against Israeli women during their Oct. 7 attacks.
""I want to ask you about sexual violence, and it’s kind of remarkable that this issue hasn’t gotten enough attention, globally. Widespread use of rape, brutal rape, sexual violence against Israeli women by Hamas. I’ve seen a lot of progressive women, generally speaking, they’re quick to defend women’s rights and to speak out against using rape as a weapon of war, but downright silent on what we saw on October 7. And what might be happening inside Gaza right now to these hostages. Why is that?"" Bash asked. 
The ""Squad"" Democrat suggested that wasn't true and claimed she had already condemned Hamas' treatment of women before quickly turning the conversation back to Israel.
""But I think we have to remember Israel is a democracy. That is why they’re a strong ally of ours. And if they do not comply with international humanitarian law, they are bringing themselves to a place that makes it much more difficult strategically for them to be able to build allies, to keep public opinion with them, and frankly, morally, we cannot say that one war crime deserves another. That is not what international humanitarian law says,"" Jayapal said.

""With respect, I was just asking about the women, and you turned it back to Israel. I’m asking you about Hamas,"" Bash said. 
The lawmaker said she had already answered the question and added, ""we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians. Fifteen thousand Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air strikes, three-quarters of whom are women and children."" 
""And it’s horrible,"" Bash said. ""But you don’t see Israeli soldiers raping Palestinian women.""
""I don’t want this to be the hierarchies of oppressions,"" Jayapal said.

ISRAELI POLICE SAY EXTREME SEXUAL VIOLENCE, RAPE BY HAMAS TERRORISTS WAS ‘SYSTEMATIC’
The official UN Women X account was widely criticized this week after explicitly condemning the Hamas massacre in Israel for the first time as well as the terrorist group's treatment of women, nearly two months after the attack happened. 
U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres announced on Wednesday that the UN would be investigating the Hamas attacks and their use of sexual violence against Israeli women. 
""There are numerous accounts of sexual violence during the abhorrent acts of terror by Hamas on 7 October that must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted,"" Guterres said. His statement added: ""Gender-based violence must be condemned. Anytime. Anywhere.""

""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin has also called out international women's organizations for their silence on the sexual violence used against Israeli women.
""The fact that sexual violence was used against Israeli women, and the major women’s groups in this country have not come out and denounced it. This weekend, Sheryl Sandberg put out a gripping video calling for it. That violates every rule of warfare. It is the height of immorality and the fact that the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Women Empowerment has been silent, the U.N. Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women has been silent, and the international MeToo movement has been silent,"" Griffin said.

Fetterman denies Israel has committed war crimes in Gaza,2023-12-05,Fox News,['Gabriel Hays'],"During a CNN interview, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., trashed accusations that Israel has committed war crimes it its retaliation for Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack. 
Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., ripped claims in a new interview that Israel has committed war crimes in its retaliatory strikes against Hamas following its Oct. 7 massacre in the country.
Fetterman told CNN anchor Abby Phillip Monday night that Hamas must be destroyed in order for Israelis to exist peacefully and said he values the lives of innocent Palestinian children as much as he does innocent Israeli children. The Democrat has taken heat from the party's left flank for his staunch support of Israel in media and public appearances.
Phillip brought up accusations Israel has committed war crimes in Gaza following the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. 
""Do you believe that anything that Israel has done in these six weeks of fighting has amounted to a war crime?"" she asked.

""Of course not. Of course not,"" Fetterman said. ""And it’s like, let’s not forget what Hamas started. They broke the first cease-fire, and then they attacked Israel and murdered over 1,200 innocent, women, children, babies, everything, and brutalized it in the most unspeakable kinds of ways.""
""And so… this is absolutely an unequivocal attack to destroy Israel and we must remember that’s [what] started all of this.""
""But are you comfortable, Senator, with the number of Palestinians that have lost their lives, 7,000 children, 15 or 16,000 civilians dead? Do you believe Israel is doing enough to minimize civilian casualties?"" Phillip asked.
""One death is too many. It is tragic,"" Fetterman said. ""I don’t value any Palestinian’s child life any more than, or any less than, my own child as well, too. It’s heartbreaking and it is awful.""

Still, he clarified the necessity for the Jewish state to wipe out Hamas, adding, ""But, I do fundamentally believe that Israel must destroy Hamas to achieve conditions that allow for peace to prosper.""
Fetterman has been a strong supporter of Israel in the wake of Hamas October terror attack, a stance that has put him at odds with fellow progressives.
Former staffers have criticized his stance, with one stating that it ""has felt like a gutting betrayal.""
Last month, Fetterman also made news for waving an Israel flag in front of pro-Palestinian protesters attempting to confront him over his support for the country. Several of the protesters yelled ""Shame!"" at the lawmaker as he walked past, in addition to accusing him of supporting genocide.

Iran shares chilling message for Israel after Gaza hospital explosion kills 500: ‘Time is OVER’,2023-10-18,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"FOX News contributor Joe Concha joined 'FOX & Friends First' to discuss Biden's visit to Israel as the war against Hamas continues. 
Iran’s foreign minister posted an ominous tweet on Wednesday that said time is ""running out"" for Israel. The post was made hours after a Hamas-run hospital in Gaza suffered an explosion that reportedly left hundreds dead.
Hossein Amir-Abdollahian posted the tweet after Hamas blamed Israel for the blast at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, where the Gaza health ministry said more than 500 were killed. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) denied attacking the hospital and has since investigated the blast. The IDF determined the blast was caused by a rocket misfire launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. U.S. intelligence also points to a terror group, and not Israel, as causing the explosion.
""After the terrible crime of the Zionist regime in the bombing and massacre of more than 1,000 innocent women and children in the hospital, the time has come for the global unity of humanity against this fake regime more hated than ISIS and its killing machine,"" Amir-Abdollahian tweeted.
He added: ""Time is OVER!""

The post follows similar remarks Amir-Abdollahian made during a televised interview.
""Time is running out very fast,"" he said. ""If the war crimes against the Palestinians are not immediately stopped, other multiple fronts will open and this is inevitable.""
The Embassy of Israel to the United States posted a Matrix meme in response to Iran's embassy in Syria tweeting the same ""time is up"" warning.
BIDEN SAYS ISRAEL NOT TO BLAME FOR ROCKET ATTACK ON GAZA HOSPITAL THAT LEFT 500 DEAD: 'DONE BY THE OTHER TEAM'
Other regional leaders have expressed strong language in the fallout of the hospital explosion. 
On Tuesday, Jordan's King Abdullah II said: ""This war, which has entered a dangerous phase, will plunge the region into an unspeakable disaster.""
President Biden, who landed in Israel on Wednesday, denied Israel's involvement in the hospital blast.
During a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said he reviewed evidence and strongly suggested it was the result of a terror group.

Judge lets lawsuit claiming Biden admin knew US funds were aiding Palestinian terrorists move forward,2023-10-11,Fox News,['Brianna Herlihy'],"President Biden says the U.S. stands with Israel, saying, There is no justification for terrorism.
A federal judge in Texas on Tuesday evening ordered the discovery phase of a lawsuit accusing the Biden administration of knowingly providing funds that benefited Palestinian terrorists get underway.
America First Legal (AFL) first filed the lawsuit in 2022, alleging that President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken resumed payments to the Palestinian Authority (PA) that former President Trump ended in order to be in compliance with the Taylor Force Act — a federal law that prohibits the government from sending American taxpayer dollars to the PA until it stops supporting terrorism. 
The lawsuit claims the Biden administration has transferred nearly half a billion American taxpayer dollars ""to directly benefit and subsidize the Palestinian Authority"" while admitting that the PA still operates its ""Pay to Slay"" program – which encourages terrorist attacks against persons living in and visiting the State of Israel.
Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, of the Northern District of Texas, found Tuesday that AFL’s ""recent production of records shows that the Government knew its economic support fund (ESF) funding in the West Bank and Gaza was benefiting Palestinian terrorists, thereby ‘increasing the risk of terrorist attacks against the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated.’""

""And they aver that the Government's ‘admission that its activities in the West Bank and Gaza benefit Hamas suggests, with reasonable particularity, the possible existence of other facts, currently hidden, establishing traceability,’"" the order says.
""These reasons, in concert with Hamas's recent attack on Israel that killed fourteen Americans and resulted in others being held hostage, provide a sufficient basis for Plaintiffs Request,"" Kacsmaryk wrote. 
AFL asked the court to grant what is called expedited and limited jurisdictional discovery, which will require the Biden administration to produce related documents and testimony for the court. 
The legal group represents Congressman Ronny Jackson, R-Texas; Stuart and Robbi Force, parents of West Point graduate Taylor Force murdered by a Palestinian terrorist in Tel Aviv – after whom the Taylor Force Act was named; and Sarri Singer, the survivor of a suicide bombing on a Jerusalem bus. 
""This case is about the Palestinian Authority’s decades-long program of financial payments, social services, misinformation, and indoctrination to incentivize terrorist attacks against persons living in or visiting the State of Israel. The program is known as ‘Pay to Slay,’"" the lawsuit states.

""Under Pay to Slay, the Palestinian Authority rewards terrorists and/or their families with increased rewards in proportion to the casualties inflicted. Terrorists who are married, or have children, or are Israeli residents/citizens receive an additional payment. Terrorists who spend more than 5 years (in a single term or cumulatively) in prison are paid a guaranteed salary by the Palestinian Authority for the rest of their lives,"" the lawsuit explains.
""Every terrorist, regardless of their affiliations or the identity of their victims, is paid by the Palestinian Authority. This includes members of designated terror organizations, such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who kill U.S. citizens,"" the lawsuit alleges. 
According to the suit, the ""Pay to Slay"" program beneficiaries include the family of Bashar Masalha who stabbed 11 people and murdered 28-year-old U.S. Army Iraq and Afghanistan war Taylor Force on March 8, 2016. Mr. Force was visiting Israel as part of his graduate program. Shortly after his death, Congress passed the legislating in his memory.

In the Taylor Force Act, Congress determined that ""The Palestinian Authority’s practice of paying salaries to terrorists serving in Israeli prisons, as well as to the families of deceased terrorists, is an incentive to commit acts of terror.""
Through the Act, Congress prohibited the Executive Branch from providing any grant or award from U.S. taxpayer funds available for assistance under chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 that ""directly benefits the Palestinian Authority"" unless the Secretary of State certifies that the Palestinian Authority is taking credible steps to end acts of violence against Israeli citizens and United States citizens and has terminated ""Pay to Slay.""
Congress also made it clear that the Palestinian Authority could directly benefit from U.S. taxpayer-funded projects in the West Bank or Gaza, or operate the ""Pay to Slay"" program, but not both. 
The lawsuit outlines that the Palestinian Authority chose ""Pay to Slay"" and consequently, the Trump Administration terminated funding.

AFL alleges, however, that when President Biden took office in January 2021, his administration transferred ""hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers to the Palestinian Authority despite ""Pay to Slay"" and contrary to the Taylor Force Act.""
""Contrary to law, they have transferred nearly half a billion American taxpayer dollars to directly benefit and subsidize the Palestinian Authority. Among other things, the defendants are unlawfully laundering U.S. taxpayer funds through non-governmental organizations to directly benefit the Palestinian Authority,"" the lawsuit alleges. 
The lawsuit says that at the time the complaint was filed in court, President Biden and Secretary Blinken ""admit that the Palestinian Authority operates ‘Pay to Slay’ to encourage terrorist attacks against persons living in and visiting the State of Israel."" 
The lawsuit was filed in December 2022.

As of July 2023, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers were still requesting an update from Blinken on the administration’s plan to end ""Pay to Slay.""
On Sept. 27, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on efforts to stop ""Pay to Slay.""
Former Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Adviser Elliott Abrams testified before the committee that he believes the Biden administration has been encouraging other nations, like Saudi Arabia, to give the PA case, undermining the Taylor Force Act. 
Blinken is expected Wednesday to meet with senior Israeli officials and ""reiterate his condolences for the victims of the terrorist attacks against Israel and condemn those attacks in the strongest terms,"" a statement from his office said Tuesday. 
"" The Secretary will also reaffirm the United States’ solidarity with the government and people of Israel,"" the statement said. "" He will also discuss measures to bolster Israel’s security and underscore the United States’ unwavering support for Israel’s right to defend itself.""

Freed Israeli hostage claims Hamas’ Gaza leader was silent after confronting him in tunnel,2023-11-29,Fox News,['Greg Norman'],"The 'Outnumbered' panel discussed the latest on the release of Hamas hostages and Palestinian protesters openly defending the terror organization.
One of the first Israeli hostages to have been freed by Hamas is now saying she confronted the terrorist group's Gaza leader in a tunnel underneath the territory during her time in captivity. 
Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, told the Israeli newspaper Davar that Yahya Sinwar paid the hostages a visit and ""was with us three to four days after we arrived,"" according to Reuters. 
""I asked him how he is not ashamed to do such a thing to people who all these years have supported peace,"" she reportedly said. ""He didn't answer. He was silent."" 
Lifshitz was freed by Hamas on Oct. 23 in one of the first hostage releases of the war.

Prior to their capture from their home in the Nir Oz kibbutz near the Israel-Gaza border, Yocheved and her 83-year-old husband Oded – who remains in captivity – were activists who helped sick Gazans receive medical care in Israel, her grandson Daniel Lifshitz previously told Reuters.  
""They are human rights activists, peace activists for all their life,"" Daniel Lifshitz was quoted as saying. 
""For more than a decade, they took... sick Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, not from the West Bank, from the Gaza Strip every week from the Erez border to the hospitals in Israel to get treatment for their disease, for cancer, for anything,"" he added.

Yocheved Lifshitz said civilians beat her once she was brought into Gaza before being moved into an extensive tunnel system where Hamas did provide hostages with some medicine and hygiene supplies, according to Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst.  
In late October, Lifshitz’s daughter Sharone described to reporters in Tel Aviv the manner in which she was captured on Oct. 7.  
""My mom is saying she was taken on the back of a motor bike with her body with her legs on one side and her head on the other side,"" Sharone Lifshitz said. ""That she was taken through the plow fields with men in front on one side and men behind her.""

Israel subsequently declared war on Hamas, killing more than 11,000 people in Gaza since Oct. 7, with 40% of them being children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Protests have erupted over the conflict in New York City, throughout the U.S., and around the world.

UCLA professor of political science Dov Waxman joined ""FOX News Live"" Saturday, saying that the protests in U.S. cities and on college campuses can support Palestinians without supporting terrorism. He said, however, that many people confuse the two. ""They certainly don't have a sophisticated view of the conflict,"" Waxman told co-host Eric Shawn. ""They don't really have an understanding of the history of this conflict. Many believe it began with the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in Gaza, not knowing that it actually long predates that. They don't really know about Hamas as a terrorist organization, or what Hamas seeks to do.""""Sometimes, there's a kind of confusion in these protests as to what exactly they're calling for – are they signaling their support for Hamas, or are they really signaling their support for the Palestinian cause at large?""

Left-wing activist billionaire George Soros is facing intense criticism
 from Israel’s ambassador to the U.N. for pumping over $15 million into a network of nongovernmental organizations that allegedly support Hamas.
""George Soros’ donations to organizations that seek the destruction of the State of Israel as a Jewish state is shameful. However, I am not surprised,"" Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan told Fox News Digital.
Hamas launched a full-blown invasion into southern Israel Oct. 7, resulting in the mass murder of 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans. Hamas also took more than 200 hostages. American citizens were among civilians kidnapped by the jihadi terrorist entity.
""For years, Soros has backed and transferred money to organizations supporting BDS that want to isolate Israel,"" added Erdan, who has been leading the diplomatic campaign at the U.N. to spell out Hamas’ crimes against humanity. ""They have never been about real peace or any solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""

BDS is an abbreviation for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign targeting the Jewish state. The German and Austrian parliaments classified BDS as an antisemitic movement that resembles the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses during the nascent phase of the Holocaust.
Rachel Ehrenfeld, author of ""The Soros Agenda,"" told Fox News Digital, ""Support of pro-Hamas, pro-Palestinian groups in the U.S. is not limited to foreign entities. It also comes directly and indirectly from U.S.-based foundations. George and Alexander Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF) is one of them.""

A U.S. defense official tells Fox News that Iranian proxy groups have attacked American forces in the Middle East at least 75 times since October 17.
The most recent attack was on Friday, where multiple rockets targeted Patrol Base Shaddadi in Syria. There was no damage to infrastructure or any injuries to personnel.
36 of the strikes happened in Iraq, while 39 of the attacks occurred in Syria. Iranian proxy groups have been using a mix of rockets and one-way drones to target American forces.
The latest attack happened shortly after the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Carney shot down an Iranian-made drone launched by Houthis in Yemen.
""At the time of the shoot-down, the USS Carney was escorting the USNS SUPPLY (Oiler) and another U.S.-flagged and -crewed ship carrying military equipment to the region,"" U.S. Central Command said to Fox News Digital. ""There were no injuries to U.S. personnel and no damage to U.S. vessels.""

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin criticized recent Iranian attacks on U.S. personnel in the Middle East at the Reagan National Defense Forum on Saturday.
Speaking from Simi Valley, California, Austin acknowledged that Iran is ""raising tensions"" by launching strikes against American forces in Iraq and Syria.
""We will not tolerate attacks on American personnel,"" Austin stated. ""And so these attacks must stop.""

""And until they do, we will do what we need to do to protect our troops and to impose costs on those who attack them,"" he continued.
The defense secretary also spoke about the Israel-Hamas war, arguing that protecting Gazan civilians is ""both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative.""
""I personally pushed Israeli leaders to avoid civilian casualties and to shun irresponsible rhetoric and to prevent violence by settlers in the West Bank and to dramatically expand access humanitarian aid,"" Austin added.

Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to protest the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
The protesters waved Palestinian flags and held up signs reading ""Stop the Violence"" and ""Full Cease-Fire.""
One large banner read ""From the U.S. to Palestine, Abolish the Settle State."" Some of the signs were critical of President Biden, with at least one calling him ""Genocide Joe.""
New York Police Department (NYPD) officers were at the scene of the protest. Officers were seen guarding the museum behind a barricade fence.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that Wessam Farhat, Hamas’ Shejaiya Battalion Commander, was killed by IDF fighter jets on Saturday.
In a joint statement with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), the IDF said that Farhat had commanded the battalion since 2010.

According to the IDF, Farhat was responsible for killing six Israeli soldiers during Operation Protective Edge in 2014. On October 7, the commander sent Hamas terrorists to Kibbutz Nahal Oz and the IDF post at Nahal Oz.
Farhat was involved in terroristic activities for approximately three decades.
""In 1995, while he was on his way to carry out a suicide attack in Israel, Farhat was apprehended by security forces and imprisoned in an Israeli prison for ten years,"" the IDF explained. ""Following his return to Gaza, he worked in rocket production for the Hamas terrorist organization.""
""Since the beginning of the war, the IDF and ISA have significantly degraded the Shejaiya Battalion’s capabilities, including the elimination of their senior commanders and the striking of terror infrastructure and weapons,"" the statement added.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Saturday that a missing Israeli colonel was actually killed on October 7.
""Tonight it finally became clear that Col. Assaf Hamami, a hero of Israel, fell in a battle on October 7th,"" Netanyahu said. ""Assaf was the southern brigade commander in the Gaza Division.""
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that Hamami was 41 years old and from Kiryat Ono, near Tel Aviv.

""Two weeks ago I met with his family,"" the prime minister explained. ""We prayed together for a different result and unfortunately this result did not materialize.""
""Assaf was a hero to all of us,"" he added. ""May his memory be a blessing.""

Deputy Hamas chief Saleh Al-Arouri told Al Jazeera the terrorist group will not release any more hostages until Israel declares a cease-fire in Gaza.
Al-Arouri claimed that the only hostages in Hamas custody that were kidnapped from Israel are either Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers or men who had previously served in the IDF.
The Hamas leader asserted that the hostages would not be released until all Palestinian prisoners are released amid another cease-fire.
""Let the war take its course,"" Arouri said. ""This decision is final.""
""We will not compromise on it,"" he added.

The Israel Defense Forces said Saturday that before the temporary truce with Hamas, soldiers operating in Gaza found and destroyed several tunnels belonging to the terror group.

One tunnel shaft was discovered in the courtyard of a school complex and had a depth of dozens of meters, the IDF said. The discovery was made by troops with the 551st Reserve Brigade in the Beit Lahiya area in the northern Gaza Strip.
""The soldiers, in cooperation with special forces, worked to neutralize the underground infrastructure and they secured and isolated the areas to the north of Jabalia,"" IDF said. 
""As part of the activity, the soldiers neutralized terrorists, while cooperating with the IAF and the brigade’s intelligence and fire teams. In addition, the soldiers of the brigade destroyed enemy capabilities and terrorist targets, and seized a large amount of military equipment, including weapons, grenades, explosives, launchers and ammunition,"" the military added.

Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday outlined the Biden administration's view of what post-war Gaza should look like while emphasizing that Israel has a right to self-defense. 

At a press conference in Dubai, Harris said the United States remains committed to securing the release of American hostages held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza. She also said that Israel must abide by international humanitarian law as it conducts an offensive in Gaza to destroy the terrorist group. 
""As Israel pursues its military objectives in Gaza, we believe Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians. So we all want this conflict to end as soon as possible and to ensure Israel's security and ensure security for the Palestinian people,"" Harris said. 

After the war, the Biden administration seeks a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority's governance. ""No forcible displacement. No reoccupation. No siege or blockade. No reduction in territory and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism,"" Harris outlined. ""We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. And Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the center of this work."" 
The vice president called for international cooperation to bring an end to the war and deliver humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people. 
""The international community must dedicate significant resources to support short and long term recovery in Gaza. For example, rebuilding hospitals and housing, restoring electricity and clean water, and ensuring that bakeries can reopen and be restocked,"" she said. 

Harris also called for the Palestinian Authority security services to assume security responsibilities in Gaza and reiterated that terrorists must not be permitted to threaten Israel.
""We have been clear the Palestinians have a right to dignity and self-determination. And Israelis and Palestinians must enjoy equal measures of prosperity and freedom,"" she said. ""They also deserve all deserve a sense of safety and security. And a two state solution then remains the best path, we believe, toward a durable peace. The president and I are committed to that goal."" 


Actress Susan Sarandon has apologized for her comments at a recent pro-Palestinian demonstration that resulted in her being dropped from a major Hollywood talent agency.
In a statement posted to social media on Friday evening, Sarandon called it a ""terrible mistake"" to claim at the rally that anger and hatred Jews had experienced in the wake of the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel was just a ""taste"" of the treatment that Muslims experience in this country.

In the lengthy Instagram post, the actress said, ""Intending to communicate my concern for an increase in hate crimes, I said that Jewish Americans, as the targets of rising antisemitic hate, ""are getting a taste of what it is like to be Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.""
""This phrasing was a terrible mistake,"" she continued, ""as it implies that until recently Jews have been strangers to persecution, when the opposite is true. As we all know, from centuries of oppression and genocide in Europe, to the Tree of Life shooting in Pittsburgh, PA, Jews have long been familiar with discrimination and religious violence which continues to this day.""
The actress admonished herself again, adding, ""I deeply regret diminishing this reality and hurting people with this comment. It was my intent to show solidarity in the struggle against bigotry of all kinds, and I am sorry I failed to do so.""

Sarandon made her original controversial comments in front of a large pro-Palestinian crowd in Manhattan’s Union Square on November 17 to protest the ongoing Israel-Hamas War.

Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen slammed the United Nations after its women's agency waited 57 days to condemn the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel. 

Late Friday, UN Women, the agency for ""gender equality and women's empowerment,"" issued a statement saying, ""We deeply regret that military operations have resumed in Gaza, and we reiterate that all women, Israeli women, Palestinian women, as all others, are entitled to a life lived in safety and free from violence.""
""We unequivocally condemn the brutal attacks by Hamas on Israel on 7 October. We are alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks,"" the agency added.
That condemnation of Hamas' atrocities came 57 days after the horrific rape, torture and murder of women of all ages on Oct. 7. More than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in the attack. 
""The conduct of UN Women, the UN Secretary-General, and other UN agencies since the October 7 massacre is disgraceful,"" Cohen posted on Saturday. 

""UN Women's announcement was both feeble and late, coming after nearly two months of silence during which war crimes, crimes against humanity, and *gender-based crimes carried out by the Hamas terrorist organization were ignored,"" he wrote. 
Cohen also slammed UN support for the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel's investigation into sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas, claiming the commission is ""comprised of a clique of notorious antisemites."" 
""Any investigation must be conducted by a neutral and objective body and not by antisemitic Israel-haters,"" Cohen wrote. ""I call on the UN Women's Executive Director, who has failed to carry out her mission at this critical time, to resign.""

Rocket alerts sounded all across Israel on Saturday as fighting intensified between Israel, Hamas terrorists inside the Gaza Strip, and Hezbollah fighters firing on Israel from Lebanon. 
Alerts were activated in the city of Ashdod, in Kibbutz Kissufim near the Gaza Strip, in the Lakhish area, in the city of Ashkelon and in communities in norther Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces.

The IDF said that sirens sounded in the Galilee in northern Israel were activated because of a combat helicopter that downed a military drone that was identified as having a technical malfunction. 
The alert, that warned of rocket and missile fire, was triggered by the interception,"" the IDF said. ""The interception was carried out in a controlled manner and there is no fear of a security incident.""
Earlier, the military said it launched retaliatory strikes at Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in Lebanese territory with aircraft, mortar fire and artillery. 
""In addition, a short while ago, a number of launches toward IDF posts in the area of the Lebanese border were identified. In response, the IDF is striking the sources of the fire,"" the military said at 8:28 a.m. ET.

French President Emmanuel Macron will travel to Qatar to assist efforts to negotiate a new truce between Israel and Hamas.
Macron, speaking at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai on Saturday, told reporters that France is ""very concerned"" by the reignited violence in Gaza. He questioned the feasibility of Israel's ultimate goal in the war — to eradicate Hamas — and said all parties must double down on efforts to secure a lasting cease-fire.

""We are at a moment when Israeli authorities must more precisely define their objectives and their final goal: the total destruction of Hamas, does anyone think it is possible? If this is the case, the war will last 10 years,"" Macron said.
""There is no lasting security for Israel in the region if its security is achieved at the cost of Palestinian lives and thus of the resentment of public opinions in the region. Let's be collectively lucid,"" he added.
Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that the Mossad team in Qatar will return home after reaching an ""impasse"" in truce negotiations. 
Reuters contributed to this update.


The director general of the Red Cross said Saturday that reignited fighting between Israel and Hamas has been ""intense"" after a cease-fire deal fell apart. 

The Israel Defense Forces said Saturday that it struck 400 terrorist targets and killed an unspecified number of Hamas fighters since the fighting resumed on Friday. The Hamas-led Gaza Health Ministry said nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed since Friday. 
""We don't have precise reports but what I can say is the resumption of fighting was intense again,"" ICRC Director General Robert Mardini told Reuters at the COP28 U.N. summit in Dubai.
""It's a new layer of disruption coming on top of massive, unparalleled destruction of critical infrastructure, of civilian houses and neighbourhoods,"" he said, warning that the violence would make it difficult to get humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Mardini said the Red Cross has 130 staff working in Gaza, which he described as being in ""shambles and rubble."" 


The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Saturday that a Mossad team sent to Qatar to negotiate for another cease-fire with Hamas would return to Israel after reaching an ""impasse."" 

""Following the impasse in the negotiations and at the direction of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Mossad head David Barnea ordered his team in Doha to return to Israel,"" the prime minster's office said in a statement. 
""The terrorist organization Hamas did not fulfill its part of the agreement, which included the release of all children and women according to a list that was forwarded to Hamas and approved by it,"" it added. 
Under the previous cease-fire arrangement, Israel secured the release of 84 women and children held captive in the Gaza Strip after the Oct. 7 massacre. 
However, the truce ended Friday after both sides accused the other of violating its terms. Israel said Hamas refused to release all of the women it promised. A Palestinian official told Reuters the truce fell apart over female Israeli soldiers.

The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza on Saturday claimed that the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 15,200 in the Israel-Hamas war, and that 70% of those killed were women and children. 
That figure, which cannot be independently verified, was announced by ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra. Hamas does not distinguish between civilians and terrorist fighters killed in battle.
The previous toll given by Gaza officials was more than 13,300 dead. Al-Qidra did not explain the sharp jump. However, the ministry had only been able to provide sporadic updates since Nov. 11, amid problems with connectivity and major war-related disruptions in hospital operations. 

More than 40,000 people have been wounded, al-Qidra claimed.
Fighting resumed Friday after a cease-fire deal collapsed amid accusations from each side that the other violated the terms of the agreement. 
Many of Israel's attacks Saturday were focused on the Khan Younis area in southern Gaza, where the military said it had struck more than 50 Hamas targets with airstrikes, tank fire and its navy. Israel's military said it hit more than 400 targets across the Gaza Strip.

The chairman of the Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Center
 in Jerusalem, whose mandate is to use the example of the systematic genocide of millions of Jews by the Nazis in World War II as a teaching point to prevent such mass atrocities from happening again, believes that the rampant rise in antisemitism and anti-Zionism in the U.S., and around the world, stems from the inaction of administrators at Ivy League colleges and other institutions of higher learning.
Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan, speaking to Fox News Digital after a weeklong trip to the U.S. where he met with presidents, provosts and deans from East Coast colleges, including Columbia University, University of Pennsylvania, New York University and Queens College, said that in many of these distinguished institutions, where there has been a sharp rise in incidents of antisemitism, there were academics peddling inaccurate theories about Israel.

""In Ivy League colleges across the U.S. … there are groups of academics, not all of them, but important academics, especially in the humanities and social sciences, that are meticulously, stone-by-stone and step-by-step, building pseudo-academic, pseudo-scientific, pseudo-intellectual theories justifying the elimination of the Jewish state,"" he said.
""Violent demonstrations with students calling ‘from the river to the sea’ or for a ‘global Intifada’ are, of course, extremely disturbing,"" said Dayan, a former Israeli consul general in New York. ""But in some sense, these are just a symptom.""

""With all those academic buzzwords about the ‘ethnic-nationalistic,’ ‘settler colonial,’ ‘colonization of Palestine’ and ‘apartheid,’ they are building slowly yet constantly, a pseudo-scientific truth of academic theories,"" he said, adding that ""first it's the demonization of Israel and then justification, after that they are actively advocating for the elimination of the Jewish state, and that is terrible.""
Dayan said that calling for the elimination of the world’s only Jewish state is ""a terribly antisemitic thing to do.""

A team from Israel's Mossad intelligence agency was in Doha on Saturday for talks with Qatari mediators about a renewed cease-fire in Gaza, Reuters reported.
The report cited a source briefed on the visit who said the Qatari-mediate talks focused on the release of more hostages, not just women and children, and the details of a new truce.
Israel and Hamas have resumed fighting after a previous cease-fire arrangement collapsed on Friday. 

The truce which began on Nov. 24 saw Hamas release Israeli women and children taken hostage on Oct. 7 in exchange for the release of Palestinians, including women, held in Israeli prisons.
Israel and Hamas have traded blame over the collapse of the truce, which lasted a week and was extended twice before mediators were unable to find a way for a third extension.
Israel said Hamas refused to release all of the women held in Gaza. A Palestinian official told Reuters the truce fell apart over female Israeli soldiers.

Israeli airstrikes hit several points near Damascus in Syria, state media reported. 
“Nearly at 1.34 a.m. Saturday, the Israeli enemy carried out a missile aggression from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting some points in the vicinity of Damascus,” an unnamed military official told SANA. 
The strikes resulted in some ""material damages,"" according to the statement. 
Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps later said that two of its officers were killed in Syria, the Times of Israel reported.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based opposition war monitor, said the strikes hit in the area of the south Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab, where it said that “there are military forces working with the Lebanese Hezbollah.” It said ambulances rushed to the scene.
Israel has struck targets in Syria several times since the onset of the Hamas-Israel war on Oct. 7. On Sunday, a reported Israeli airstrike hit the international airport in Damascus and put it out of commission, just hours after the airport resumed flights following a monthlong hiatus after a previous Israeli strike.
Israel is known to have carried out hundreds of strikes in parts of Syria, aiming at Hezbollah and other terrorist groups backed by Iran, but it rarely acknowledges the attacks.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly doubled down on his position that Hamas is not a terror group and insisted they must be involved in Gaza's future after the war.
“I stand by my position. No matter what anybody says, I cannot accept Hamas as a terror group,” Erdogan told Turkish media on Saturday, according to the Times of Israel.

Those comments came in response to a question about possible U.S. sanctions on Turkey for supporting and funding Hamas, the outlet reported. 
The United States recognizes Hamas as a terrorist organization. On Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists infiltrated communities and a music festival in southern Israel, brutally raping, torturing and murdering as many as 1,200 Israelis that day and taking 240 hostages back to Gaza. The attack, labeled ""Black Shabbat"" in Israel, started the ongoing war in Gaza.
Erdogan has made several anti-Israel statements since the start of the war, accusing the Jewish state of war crimes in Gaza and calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a ""butcher."" 
Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas and its governing capability in Gaza, but Erdogan insisted Saturday that Hamas must be a part of any post-war reality for the Palestinian territory. 
The ""exclusion and destruction of Hamas is not an option,"" Erdogan said.

At least two people were injured Friday afternoon and a protester was in critical condition after attempting to light themselves on fire outside the building that houses the Israeli Consulate General in Atlanta, officials said. 

Officials don't believe the incident was terrorism, the ATF said in a press briefing, calling it likely an ""extreme act of political protest."" A Palestinian flag that was used in the protest was recovered after the incident. 
A security guard who works at the building was burned on the wrist and leg while trying to stop the protester, the ATF said. 
Both people have been taken to the hospital. 
The midtown Atlanta office building houses the Israeli Consulate General, among other offices. 
Atlanta police responded to the scene as well as the FBI and ATF. 

""We are saddened to learn of the self-immolation at the entrance to the office building,"" Anat Sultan-Dadon, Consul General of Israel to the Southeastern United States said in a statement. ""It is tragic to see the hate and incitement toward Israel expressed in such a horrific way. The sanctity of life is our highest value. Our prayers are with the security officer who was injured while trying to prevent this tragic act. We are grateful to the city of Atlanta’s law enforcement and first responders for all they do to ensure safety.""

Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire hit targets in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday as Israel advances its campaign to eradicate Hamas.
Fighting resumed on Friday after a cease-fire agreement between the two sides collapsed. The Israeli military said that in the last 24 hours combined attacks by its ground, air and naval forces had hit 400 militant targets and killed an unspecified number of Hamas fighters.

The Hamas-led Health Ministry in Gaza claims at least 178 people have been killed by Israel since the end of the truce, adding to the more than 13,300 Palestinians killed during the war. At least 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Oct. 7 terror attack that started the conflict.
The warring sides blamed each other for the collapse of the seven-day truce, during which Hamas had released hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
United Nations officials have decried the renewed fighting, saying it will worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
""Hell on Earth has returned to Gaza,"" said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian office in Geneva.

The Chicago City Council on Friday passed a resolution during a special meeting to show solidarity with Israel that saw pro-Palestinian protesters removed from the chambers as tensions flared over events happening thousands of miles away. 
The measure was passed in a voice vote with no official tally taken following nearly three hours of a sometimes heated debate. Under the Israel Solidarity Resolution, the city will ""condemn this heinous terrorist attack by Hamas, stand in support of Israel, express our deepest sorrow for all innocent civilians, and pray for the safe release of all the hostages taken into Gaza.""
Supporters of the Palestinians were at City Hall protesting against the measure, calling it ""Anti-Palestinian."" They had planned to ""flood city hall"" with hopes of blocking the show of support to Israel.

The vote came as Israel continues its military offensive against the Hamas terrorist group following the killing and kidnapping of Israeli civilians, including babies and young children, in communities near the Gaza Strip last week. 
At one point, Mayor Brandon Johnson ordered the sergeant-at-arms to remove everyone on the second floor of the council chambers after the protesters kept interrupting the city clerk as she read the proposed resolution, FOX Chicago reported.
They began protesting in the lobby. Some protesters chanted, ""Free, free Palestine."" At one point, when a person supporting Israel interrupted, the crowd began chanting, ""Kick them out!"" The council eventually took a five-minute break as the protesters were cleared out. 
The resolution was proposed by Alderperson Debra Silverstein. During the debate, Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez stated her opposition to the measure. 
""Although I wholeheartedly agree that the attacks from Hamas are brutal and that no one should be subjected to that violence, I also understand that the situation is more nuanced than what this resolution expresses,"" he said.

During his remarks, Alderman Raymond Lopez assailed critics of Israel amid the deadly events perpetrated on its citizens. 
""Too many in here and out have worked to manufacture a narrative and blame the victim of terror as being responsible for what has unfolded,"" he said. ""Would any of us… would try to legitimize attacks on our own country following 9/11? Would we have given excuse or safe harbor or an apology to Osama bin Laden for killing nearly 3,000 Americans?""
Several American cities have seen protests against Israel by pro-Palestinian supporters since the Oct. 7 attack. Instead of condemning Hamas, many have spoken out against Israel for military operations in besieged territory, citing civilian casualties.

Israel has stopped supplying the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip with electricity, food, water and fuel. On Thursday, Israel’s military told some 1 million people to evacuate to the southern part of Gaza ahead of an expected ground invasion. 
Israel has long accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields. Hamas told Gazans to ignore the evacuation order.

Foreign survivors of brutal Hamas attack on Israel recall terror massacre : ‘Everything was burning’,2023-11-05,Fox News,['Ruth Marks Eglash'],"FOX News correspondent Trey Yingst reports from southern Israel on the number of hostages inside Gaza and the growing number of Israeli airstrikes on 'FOX News Live.'
JERUSALEM – For Mitchai Sarabon, a Thai fieldhand working on Kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel, Oct. 7 started like any other Saturday. His one day off a week, the 32-year-old said, he woke early and began doing his laundry. His friends – a mix of Thai migrant workers and Nepalese agricultural students – were also milling about the compound where they lived on the edge of the kibbutz, taking care of various personal tasks, when suddenly they heard gunshots.  
""Suddenly, I saw one of the Nepalese guys being shot, others ran to hide in a bomb shelter and then the terrorists arrived,"" Sarabon recounted to Fox News Digital in a video interview from his home in Udon Thani, Thailand, on Friday. ""They threw a grenade inside, some of the people died instantly and others ran away, they were shot dead too.""  
Sarabon also began to run, taking cover inside his living quarters, crouching in the kitchen, and turning off the lights. But hiding did not help, Sarabon said. The terrorists soon found him and the five other people with him, first lobbing in grenades and then shooting everyone who was still alive. Sarabon, who served in the Thai military before moving to Israel for work, made the impulsive decision to break the kitchen window and climb out.

""Everything was burning, the room, the people and I just decided to jump out and run,"" he said, showing Fox News Digital scars from shrapnel and two gunshot wounds in his side and upper chest. Running from the burning building, Sarabon said he almost made it to the edge of the kibbutz’s orange groves when the terrorists shot at him again, this time hitting him in the head.  
Just 2.5 miles from the border with Gaza, Kibbutz Alumim was one of some 22 agricultural communities ruthlessly attacked by thousands of Hamas terrorists who invaded Israel four weeks ago. While the majority of the 1,400 people killed in the assault, which also included infiltrations into two cities and a music festival, were Israeli nationals, among the victims were also those like Sarabon – Thai nationals in Israel for agricultural work.

Israel’s agricultural communities – communal kibbutzim like Alumim and independent farmers – have relied on migrant workers from Thailand for years and most arrive as part of a bilateral economic agreement struck between the two countries in 2012. Just prior to Oct. 7, around 6,000 out of some 30,000 Thais nationals were working in southern Israel, near the Gaza periphery.

Thailand’s ambassador to Israel, Pannabha Chandraramya, who met on Thursday with Israel’s President Isaac Herzog, said the Thai people were still reeling from the attack. 
""I think we are the second group after Israel who suffer with this loss,"" she told the president, adding that so far the Thai death toll was 23, with 29 being held captive in Gaza. Four more Thai nationals, Chandraramya said, were still hospitalized in critical condition. More than 7,000 Thais have left Israel since the attack, returning home on government-sponsored flights.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Thai Prime Minister Sarata Thavisin last week, expressing condolences over those who were murdered by Hamas and promising to work to bring about the release of the abductees.  
Volunteers working with the Thais who have chosen to remain in Israel believe that the number of dead might be much higher as the Israeli authorities continue to struggle to identify bodies so badly burned and brutalized by Hamas that only tiny pieces remain.

Dr. Yahel Kurlander, a migration scholar, and an expert on the subject of Thai migrant workers in Israel, said that for the Thai nationals, the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack ""has been much messier than for the Israelis.""   
""The identification process has been extremely difficult,"" she said. ""There are no biological relatives in Israel, and they first tried to identify the dead using AI technology, but in most cases, they need to wait for DNA samples to arrive from Thailand.""

Immediately following the mass attack, Kurlander and others familiar with the community mobilized, helping the Thais who had survived to first evacuate the area and then find alternative places to live.  
""Some went to work with other employers because they were worried about their salaries,"" she said, describing how she tried to explain to them that they did not have to return to work immediately after such a traumatic event.  
For the others, Kurlander said, the volunteers set up a retreat, bringing them Thai food and helping them to replace lost items such as phones and clothes. Many of them were incredibly traumatized, she said, and, after consulting with professionals, were given medication.  
On Alumim, where Sarabon had been working as a manager in the citrus fields for the past five years, nine out of the 24 Thai nationals living and working there were brutally murdered and four are being held hostage. Of the Nepalese students, 10 were murdered, four were injured, and one was abducted.

""We were used to the rocket fire and the airplanes flying by, but we never thought this could happen with terrorists and guns and grenades,"" said Sarabon, who fell unconscious after being shot, a fact that most likely saved his life.  
""I still feel scared and sad for the many people that were killed,"" he said, recalling how he woke up to hear the terrorists, still nearby, discussing how no one was alive.  
""I stayed very quiet until they left, I wanted them to think I was dead too,"" said Sarabon, who was rescued by Israeli police officers several hours later, and spent 24 days recovering in an Israeli hospital before flying home to Thailand last week.  
He told Fox News Digital that he learned to speak some Arabic after spending time with Palestinian laborers, who before the attack entered daily from Gaza to also work in the kibbutz fields. The terrorists, Sarabon said, appeared to know exactly where they were going and who they were targeting in the horrific attack.  
""I’m pretty sure that the Thai people were a target of Hamas because they came specifically to the area where we lived and they called out to us in Thai,"" said the father of two. ""They spoke to us in Thai when they were trying to get us to open the door.""

Sarabon said that while he is happy to be home – far away from the rocket fire and gunshots – he is still having nightmares and feels fear deep inside.  
While he said he will never return to Israel, Sarabon said: ""I want the people of Israel to know that they are in my thoughts all the time and I want the Israeli military to know that I am on their side.""

While the Israelis continue to work to identify the bodies and as IDF forces look to free the hostages, a recent protest outside the United Nations by a number of Thais and their supporters demanded the world body do more.
""The U.N., world governments and international protesters have willfully ignored the targeted killing, abduction and torture of hundreds of Thai civilian nationals who had been working alongside both Israelis and Palestinians by Hamas on Oct. 7,"" noted one of the protesters Eric Parnes, a business immigration attorney focusing on U.S.-Thai legal matters.  
Parnes added, ""Their failure to recognize and condemn these atrocities is proof that the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms are vain and hollow.""

Tulane student who filmed violent pro-Palestinian protest blasts ‘anti-Jewish’ attitudes: ‘Deeply concerning’,2023-10-29,Fox News,['Taylor Penley'],"Tulane University student Ryan Zamos joins 'FOX & Friends Weekend' to discuss tumultuous pro-Palestinian protests that rocked the streets of New Orleans amid the Israel-Hamas war.
A pro-Palestinian protest erupted into violence near Tulane University in New Orleans last Thursday as similar unrest continues to rock major cities and college campuses across the nation.
Video appears to show two protesters standing in the back of a truck. One wearing a mask is holding a Palestinian flag. The other is attempting to set fire to an Israeli flag when counter-protesters stepped in. 
Ryan Zamos, a Tulane law student who filmed the video, spoke out about the ""terrifying"" experience Sunday on ""FOX & Friends Weekend,"" telling host Will Cain that the protests are a way of antagonizing Jewish students.
""Tulane University allowed for a pro-Palestinian protest to occur, and they did not take the preventative measures that were necessary, such as shutting down the street,"" he said.

""The car, as you see, drove by four times previously. It was on the fifth time that they attempted to burn the [Israeli] flag before students attempted to grab the flag before pro-Palestinian protesters come in and assault numerous students.""
According to the The Maroon, a student publication from Loyola University, one counter-protester threw an Israeli flag into the truck driven by pro-Palestinian protesters before attacking the truck and stealing its key fob, forcing the protesters to park on the side of the road.
FOX 8, an affiliate based in New Orleans, reported that authorities attempted to keep the crowd under control, adding that multiple arrests were made following the incident.
Zamos told Cain that Tulane's student population is approximately 44% Jewish, claiming the protest was an attempt to ""antagonize"" Jewish students by promoting hate and making them afraid to go to class.

""It's deeply concerning,"" he said, later calling on the university to take a ""firm stance against hate rather than remaining neutral.""
""These protests, they're not pro-Palestinian, they're anti-Jewish and anti-Israel,"" he added.
Tulane University President Michael A. Fitts issued a statement addressing the unrest Thursday, affirming that student safety is the university's top priority.
""Three Tulane students were assaulted at a rally intentionally staged on the public sidewalk along Freret Street, over which we do not have control. This rally was not approved or sanctioned by Tulane. There were approximately 40 plainclothes and uniformed New Orleans, Tulane, Loyola and State Police officers, including mounted police, who made several arrests. There were also dozens of Tulane staff members on hand to support students. TUPD also apprehended a suspect last night for an act of antisemitic vandalism (graffiti) to a building near campus,"" the statement read in part.

""To be clear: We condemn and are outraged by today’s violence and the hateful language and rhetoric we heard. It is counter to everything we stand for at Tulane. What started out as a peaceful demonstration unfortunately devolved into a violent incident and a dark day for our community… 
""At today’s rally, the actions of some of the protestors, many of whom were not affiliated with Tulane, were violent, deplorable, deliberately provocative and exploitative of the profound sorrow and anger so many of us have been experiencing over the last few weeks. They were also completely counter to Tulane’s values of practicing mutual respect when debating ideas and promoting viewpoints, especially with those with whom we disagree the most,"" it continued.
In a follow-up statement posted Friday, Fitts added that plans to enhance security measures, enforce the student code of conduct and provide support resources are in effect.

"Biden admin ‘unequivocally’ condemns terror group Hamas, says US ‘stands with Israel’",2023-10-07,Fox News,['Brooke Singman'],"FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest details on the Hamas attacks on Israel on 'FOX Report.'
The Biden administration ""unequivocally"" condemned terrorist organization Hamas on Saturday amid its unprecedented and ""appalling"" assaults against Israel, with President Biden and senior administration officials stressing that the United States ""stands with Israel.""
Israeli officials said at least 250 people have been killed since Hamas terrorists started firing rockets and slaughtering Israelis near the Gaza Strip, making the conflict one of the deadliest attacks in the country's history. At least 1,500 people have been wounded. 
ISRAEL'S MILITARY SAYS FORCE IS 'AT WAR' WITH HAMAS AS IDF HITS BACK AT TERROR TARGETS

He added: ""We will not ever fail to have their back."" 
Biden said his administration’s ""support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering."" 
The president, and senior administration officials, have made ""absolutely clear"" to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli officials ""across the political spectrum and their national security spectrum"" that the United States stands ""ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the government and people of Israel.""
 ISRAEL STRIKES BACK AFTER TERRORISTS KILL AT LEAST 250
The president spoke to Netanyahu on Saturday and offered ""full support to Israel."" A senior administration official said Biden and Netanyahu will stay in close contact.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed the situation with the Israeli minister of defense on Saturday as well, and is offering ""full"" U.S. military support to Israel.

Biden also spoke with the king of Jordan on Saturday, who he will stay in ""regular"" contact with. 
""The United States stands with Israel. The United States unequivocally condemns the appalling assaults against Israel by Hamas terrorists in Gaza,"" a senior administration official said Saturday evening. 
""That’s why we have taken action throughout this administration,"" the official said, adding that sanctions have been imposed on Iran for its support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations. ""That is going to continue—believe me,"" the official said. ""Hamas is a terrorist group—full stop.""

The official added: ""We will treat Hamas for what they are—they are an international terrorist organization… This was an attack by Hamas against the state and the people of Israel."" 
In a video message early Saturday morning, Netanyahu said, ""Citizens of Israel, we are at war — not in an operation, not in rounds — at war."" 
A senior administration official said the United States will continue to provide Israel with support, including intelligence sharing.

In Israel’s fight for survival against tech savvy Hamas terrorists Biden seeks to micromanage the war,2023-12-04,Fox News,['Rebekah Koffler']," FOX News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the Biden administration's response to the Middle East conflict on 'Special Report.'
As Israeli Defense Forces resumed military operations to eradicate the Hamas terrorist threat last Friday, the Biden administration is inserting itself into Israel’s war planning process, teaching the Israelis – who’ve been fighting for their survival for decades – how to properly prosecute the conflict. 
Washington warfare ""experts"" – who arguably haven’t secured a single clear military victory since 1945 – insist that Israeli military strategists alter their war plans to make their combat operations more targeted and their strikes more accurate, in order to minimize casualties, especially among civilians. 
The Biden administration’s demands, while noble-sounding, are misguided and unreasonable. Implementing these requirements, at the expense of achieving the main mission of eliminating Hamas and its entire supporting infrastructure, will likely prolong the conflict, ultimately resulting in many more Israeli and Palestinian deaths. Here’s why.
LABELING CHINA, RUSSIA AND IRAN AS NEW 'AXIS OF EVIL' WILL NOT NEUTRALIZE THE THREATS THEY POSE

Hamas is no longer your grandfather’s terrorist gang, the way it used to be years ago. Like many other non-state terrorist groups, Hamas has benefited from the democratization of technology, which has made access to weapons, military-grade components, and the know-how necessary for indigenous production, much easier across the board than it used to be. 
Consequently, Hamas is now in possession of more deadly, more advanced weaponry than it had did even a decade ago. Its much more diverse weapons arsenal makes the terrorists look and fight more like a regular military force rather than a non-state terrorist group. This levels the battlefield a lot more than it did during the 2014 Gaza War between Israeli forces and Hamas.
The employment of drone warfare enabled Hamas to catch the Israelis off guard. During the initial wave of attacks on October 7, the terror group used small tactical drones to strike multiple Israeli military targets, disrupting infrastructure and destroying surveillance towers, cameras, and communications, as the terrorists  were infiltrating across the southern border, killing some 1,200 people. This element of surprise enabled Hamas to seize, at least temporarily, what’s called in modern warfare, strategic initiative, leaving Israelis stunned and scrambling to defend itself.

Hamas has modernized its drone arsenal, which now includes ‘Zouari’ suicide drone, named after Mohammed Zouari, the late Hamas engineer and drone pilot; Ababil-2 Iranian Tactical UAV; Misagh-1 with a high explosive-fragmentation warhead; AK-103-2 with aburst-fire setting, and RAAD-T, according to Army Recognition, OE Data Integration Network and DroneSec databases.

Hamas has also significantly improved its indigenously manufactured rockets, called Qassam, having extended their range from 2-3 miles in its first iteration to 10 miles, with the Qassam 3. Today’s generation of missiles used by Hamas have a range of 150 miles, covering all of Israel.
Hamas also has been the beneficiary of Iranian weapons, technical assistance, and training. In 2020, the State Department assessed that Iran sends $100 million a year to Palestinian terrorist groups, arming and training them to attack Israel and murder its civilians as Hamas did on October 7.
According to the Wall Street Journal, 500 Hamas terrorists were trained by Iran Quds Force, the foreign-operations arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in special combat tactics, during the weeks leading up to the October 7th terrorist attacks. Hamas used combined arms tactics during the assault, synchronizing the attacks across air, land, and sea, a warfare style used by regular armies.

During the 2023 campaign, Israelis are dying at more than twice the rate as in 2014, according to the Wall Street Journal. The upgrades in weapons and tactics are the likely reasons why Hamas is a much more lethal force than it used to be, posing a much more formidable threat to the Israeli forces.
On a visit to Tel Aviv recently, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned the Israeli leadership, about ""the imperative to the United States that the massive loss of civilian life and displacement of the scale we saw in northern Gaza not be repeated in the south."" He demanded a ""clear plan in place that puts a premium on protecting civilians as well as sustaining and building on the humanitarian assistance that’s getting into Gaza.""

How in the world can the Israelis assure Washington that they will avert civilian deaths, given that Hamas is known for using civilians as human shields? How can the IDF avoid striking civilian targets if Hamas uses hospitals as operational command centers and storage facilities for weapons and combat gear?

Whether intentional or not, what the Biden administration is doing is restricting the IDF’s freedom of action and flexibility of maneuver, as Israel is striving to eliminate the existential threat to its survival. 
It is bad enough that Israel has to deal with a much more lethal and bloodthirsty enemy that is armed to the teeth. Now its defenders have to fight with one arm tied behind their back because Washington, almost certainly driven by politics, is hell-bent on micromanaging someone else’s war.

Geert Wilders under fire for promoting plan to relocate Palestinians,2023-11-26,Fox News,['Emma Colton'],"Rabbi Chaim Mentz joins ""Fox News Live"" to discuss the latest news from the Israel-Hamas war as pro-Palestinian content continues to surge on social media.
Dutch right-wing politician Geert Wilders is facing condemnation from multiple Arab states after suggesting that the war between Hamas and Israel could be remedied if Palestinians are relocated to Jordan.
""Jordan is Palestine!"" Wilders tweeted Saturday, linking to a Politico story that detailed how Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Yemen and the Arab League issued statements to condemn the suggestion that Palestinians should be relocated to Jordan.
The Palestinian Authority said Wilders' proposal is ""a call to escalate the aggression against our people and a blatant interference in their affairs and future."" While the UAE embassy in the Netherlands called Wilders' suggestion ""irresponsible,"" leaders in Jordan labeled the suggestion a ""racist position,"" Arab News reported.

""Jordan rejects any proposal that undermines the rights of the Palestinian people or their quest for an independent state,"" Jordan's foreign minister said of Wilders' position. ""We remain committed to a two-state solution with east Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state, in accordance with international consensus.""
BIDEN ADMIN WILL HAVE TO USE LEVERAGE IF AMERICANS AREN'T RELEASED, WARNS MORGAN ORTAGUS
Jordan, along with other Arab states such as Egypt, said last month it would not accept any Palestinian refugees amid the war over reported fears that Israel wants to permanently remove Palestinians from Gaza into other nations, as well as concern that militants could be among refugees, Reuters reported.
""No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,"" Jordan’s King Abdullah II said last month.

""Jordan indeed is Palestine, I already spoke about it many years ago in Israel in 2010,"" Wilders told Fox News Digital in an emailed comment Sunday. He linked to a news article from 2010 in which he detailed his argument that Jordan should be renamed Palestine.
""Changing its name to Palestine will end the conflict in the Middle East and provide the Palestinians with an alternate homeland,"" he said at the time.

Wilders said he repeated the same argument from years ago ""and Arab nations complained again and stronger, I guess because I won the Dutch national elections last week.""
""I always said that relocation should be voluntary not compulsory. But I would applaud a massive voluntary relocation indeed,"" Wilders continued in his comment to Fox.
Wilders, dubbed in the media as the ""Dutch Donald Trump,"" is the leader and founder of the Netherlands' Party for Freedom, which saw a massive election win last week that positions Wilders to form the next ruling party and potentially become the country's next prime minister.
BIDEN ADMIN WILL HAVE TO USE LEVERAGE IF AMERICANS AREN'T RELEASED, WARNS MORGAN ORTAGUS
""I had to pinch my arm,"" Wilders said after the surprising election results, the Times of Israel reported. Wilders has only once before come close to governing the Netherlands when he supported the first coalition formed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte in 2010.

He has also championed closing the Netherlands' borders to immigrants, called for a referendum on the Netherlands leaving the European Union, has been labeled anti-Islamic, and he faced death threats over a handful of previous statements, including calling Islam a ""fascist ideology"" and a ""backward religion"" and arguing Muhammad was a ""pedophile,"" Reuters reported.

"Gaza hospital coverage proves media needs to be skeptical of sources, expert says: ‘All the facts were wrong’",2023-10-27,Fox News,['Brian Flood'],"National Center for Audio and Video Forensics founder David Notowitz said ""Hamas is not a reliable news source"" after years of pushing propaganda.
The legacy media’s widely panned coverage of last week's Gaza hospital explosion raised eyebrows across the globe and resulted in multiple corrections and editor’s notes. National Center for Audio and Video Forensics founder David Notowitz, who sniffs out deceptive and misleading evidence for a living, was among the many who were stunned anyone allowed the Hamas-backed Gaza Health Ministry to set the initial framing of the story. 
Notowitz believes the media backlash could have been avoided if journalists simply followed the common-sense methods he uses when determining the trustworthiness of evidence and sources.
""Hamas is not a reliable news source, ever. Now, you should be skeptical of anything they give you. It might be real, but you should be skeptical. Skeptical of any videos, any stills, any news they give you. It could be accurate, but check your sources and check other sources other than them,"" Notowitz told Fox News Digital. 
""A missile was shot off from Gaza intending to reach Jews. It misfired, landed in a parking lot in the Gaza hospital. Immediately, Hamas Health Ministry announced it was the fault of the IDF. And immediately, The New York Times, Reuters, BBC, they all swallowed it. They didn't even look into it,"" Notowitz added. ""They didn't try to get other opinions… way too quick on them for doing that."" 
MEDIA HAS EGG ON ITS FACE FOR ALLOWING HAMAS TO SET INITIAL TONE OF GAZA HOSPITAL COVERAGE WITHOUT SKEPTICISM
The legacy media’s widely panned coverage of last weeks Gaza hospital exposition raised eyebrows across the globe and resulted in multiple corrections and editor’s notes.  (DAWOOD NEMER/AFP via Getty Images)
Indeed, The New York Times, Reuters, and the BBC were among news outlets who rushed to report claims made by the Gaza Health Ministry that Israel bombed Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital through an airstrike resulting in over 500 civilian casualties. Subsequent reporting and intelligence found it was an explosion in the hospital's parking lot stemming from a misfired rocket fired by Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, resulting in a death toll a fraction of what Hamas had first alleged.
Notowitz feels that the rise in deepfake videos and the ease in which photos can be altered should make journalists more skeptical than ever. In addition, Hamas, which controls the Gaza Health Ministry that was quickly cited by the press, has a long history of pushing propaganda and misinformation. 
""Not only was it not the hospital, it was the parking lot of the hospital. And not only was it not IDF, it was, you know, a terrorist within Gaza firing this off. And on top of that, although it's sad there were 50 people that died approximately, even that's not confirmed, but not 500. So, all the facts were wrong. All the facts are exaggerated,"" Notowitz said. 
In the days since, the Times admitted that ""editors should have taken more care with the initial presentation"" of the explosion. CNN issued a similarly glaring correction, noting that an article ""did not clearly attribute claims about Israel’s responsibility to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza,"" and other news outlets have update coverage to reveal they initially jumped the gun. 
Notowitz, who regularly provides expert courtroom testimony regarding audio and video evidence, said the Times specifically made a ""really bad mistake"" and noted it took the paper six days to come clean. He hopes news organizations learned valuable lessons when it comes to trusting Hamas and said the terror group has a long history of pushing misleading information and doctored evidence to the press. 
MEDIA RUNNING HAMAS NARRATIVE ON GAZA HOSPITAL 'DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED' TO ENDANGERING US EMBASSIES ABROAD

An alarming report from Vanity Fair suggested that senior Times editors appeared to brush off concerns from other staffers when relying on information from Hamas. An international editor suggested the attribution should not hang ""something so big"" on a single source without first trying to verify the information, according to the report that cited internal Slack messages. 
""I think the first thing to think about when you're looking at videos, stills, images, documents, anything coming in, any news form, is do you trust the source? Is this source proven to be someone that you can generally trust over the long term? And I think that's going to be the bottom line now,"" Notowitz said. 
""There are subtitles that are changed, and you can have images easily edited on Photoshop. And, you know, even actors are used. I've seen, you know, Gaza has videos in the past where they've acted out scenes, recorded them and sent them to the press and people swallow them as accurate,"" he continued. ""So, I think it comes down to trying to find the original form of that evidence, who has it, who recorded it.""
NEW YORK TIMES ADMITS IT RELIED 'TOO HEAVILY' ON HAMAS CLAIMS IN INITIAL REPORT ON GAZA HOSPITAL EXPLOSION
Morgan Ortagus, former State Department spokesperson during the Trump administration and founder of Polaris National Security, told Fox News Digital the media's disinformation push ""directly contributed"" to the riots that erupted outside U.S. embassies in several Middle East countries which continues a ripple effect, putting Americans overseas in danger.  
""That in turn requires the military to scramble to send more reinforcements to the embassies. And, if the riots get worse, we will have to evacuate,"" Ortagus said. ""It is enormously expensive and requires us to divert forces from other theaters, like Asia, to deal with the emergency situation created from actual fake news.""

"Gov. Whitmer roasted over slow, ‘gobbledegook’ response to Hamas attacks on Israel: ‘Say their names’",2023-10-08,Fox News,"['Landon Mion', 'Kyle Morris']","Foundation for Defense of Democracy senior vice president of research Jonathan Schanzer discusses the 'horrific attacks' by Hamas in Israel on 'FOX Report.'
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, was criticized on social media for not saying enough in her statement about the attack against Israel by Hamas terrorists.
In a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, the governor said she spoke with ""communities impacted by what’s happening in the region,"" but failed to mention ""Israel"" by name.
""I have been in touch with communities impacted by what’s happening in the region. It is abhorrent. My heart is with all those impacted. We need peace in this region,"" Whitmer wrote.
The post drew criticism for her omission of Israel's name, as the country faces ongoing attacks from Hamas militants.

""Say their names...Israelis were murdered by Palestinian terrorists. I know this is hard for rich, white liberals like yourself,"" NewsBusters managing editor Cutis Houck replied.
Fox News Radio host Guy Benson called the governor's statement ""Weak.""
Richard Grenell, former acting director of National Intelligence under former President Trump, said the post was ""pathetic"" and asked why Whitmer would not express support for Israel.
""This is a pathetic statement,"" he wrote. ""Why can’t you say you support Israel? This is the Left in America. Wise up.""
In another reply, Grenell said to the governor, ""This could be about Hawaii. You have terrible instincts.""
Aryeh Lightstone, who served as senior advisor to former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman during the Trump administration, said he is embarrassed for Whitmer and is disappointed that he once hosted her for Thanksgiving in Israel.
""Dear @GovWhitmer I hosted you for Thanksgiving in Israel just a few years ago. I am embarrassed for you and by you & disappointed that I opened my home and my family to you,"" Lightstone wrote.

BIDEN ADMIN ‘UNEQUIVOCALLY’ CONDEMNS TERROR GROUP HAMAS, SAYS US ‘STANDS WITH ISRAEL’
Daniel Turner, the founder and executive director of Power the Future, a leading industry group that represents energy workers nationwide, also took aim at Whitmer for her comments.
""It took your office… 12 hours… to tweet complete gobbledegook. Congrats, Governor. This is exactly who we know you to be,"" Turner wrote in response.
""This so the … moral equivalent of 'some people did something'. Leaders who are afraid to call evil evil are a threat to a free people. Rest assured if this was a farmer buying seeds during COVID lockdown your words would have been quite decisive,"" Turner added in another tweet.
Retired U.S. Army Colonel James Hutton also blasted Whitmer's response to the terror attacks, calling her words ""disgusting.""
""You didn't even mention the one country that was attacked, Israel. You make it clear that you think Israel and Hamas are moral equivalents. Disgusting,"" Hutton wrote. ""The people of Israel will prevail despite your kind of thinking.""
Many of the replies under Whitmer's post asked her to state the region and communities she was referring to.
Following the pushback, Whitmer made another post in which she included Israel's name. She said the loss of lives in the country is heartbreaking, and condemned the violence against Israel.
""The images that continue to come out of Israel on the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War are devastating. The loss of lives in Israel –children and families – is absolutely heartbreaking and appalling,"" the governor said in her follow-up post on X. ""There is no justification for violence against Israel. My support is steadfast.""
The replies said the follow-up was an improvement from her initial post, but that Whitmer still needed to state that Hamas terrorists were responsible for the attack.
""And who were the people who did this? Say their name[s]. Coward,"" Houck wrote.

""Your support is so steadfast you couldn't state it the first time around and had to be twitter shamed into a second statement,"" said Stephen L. Miller, contributing editor at The Spectator.

Biden says Israel not to blame for rocket attack on Gaza hospital that left 500 dead: ‘Done by the other team’,2023-10-18,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"President Biden held a brief press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where the U.S. president said Israel was not responsible for a rocket attack on a hospital in Gaza that left 500 people dead.
President Biden arrived in Israel on Wednesday, where he held a brief press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In their remarks, both leaders highlighted the death toll, the atrocities committed by Hamas, and the impact on children in Israel.
Biden also said Israel was not to blame for a rocket attack on a hospital in Gaza, which left at least 500 people dead.
""I was outraged by the bombing of the hospital yesterday. Based on what I’ve seen, it was done by the other team. Not you,"" Biden said to Netanyahu. ""But there's a lot of people out there who are not sure.""

Biden added: ""The world is looking. Israel has a value set like the United States does and other democracies and they're looking to see what we're going to do.""
Netanyahu spoke first during the presser, applauding Biden for being the first U.S. president to visit Israel during a wartime.
""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1400 Israelis, maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. That's 20 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that we live in infamy,"" he said. 
Netanyahu continued: ""I want to thank you for coming here today and for the unequivocal support you've given during these trying times. A support that reflects the overwhelming will of the American people. I've seen your support every day and the depth and breadth of cooperation that we have had since the beginning of this war, a level of cooperation that is truly unprecedented in the history of the great alliance between our two nations.""
He added: ""We see that support and your steadfast commitment to provide Israel with the tools we need to defend ourselves. We see that support and the clear message you send our enemies not to test our resolve. And in the two American carrier battle groups that you send to the region. To back up those words with action."" 
""Above all, Mr. President, the world sees that support and the moral clarity that you have demonstrated from the moment Israel was attacked. You've rightly drawn a clear line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism,"" Netanyahu said. ""You describe what Hamas did as sheer evil. It is exactly that.""

The Israeli prime minister also urged the president to imagine what the Israeli children were imagining when Hamas fighters broke into their homes and found their hiding spots.
""Hamas murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children. They burned people alive. They raped and murdered women. They beheaded soldiers that they search for the secret hiding places where parents had their children,"" he said. ""And just imagine, Mr. President, the fear and the panic of those little children in their last moments as the monsters discovered find out their hiding places. Hamas kidnapped women, children, elderly, Holocaust survivors. I know you share outrage on this and I know you share our determination to bring these people back.""
Biden responded. ""It's beyond my comprehension."" He also said Hamas was guilty of slaughtering Israelis: ""They've committed evils that atrocities that make ISIS somewhat more rational."" 
The two left the conference without answering any questions. Biden will meet privately with the Israeli leaders. 
The president's comments about the hospital came after a Hamas-run hospital that was treating wounded Palestinians and sheltering many others in the Gaza Strip was hit and exploded Tuesday, killing hundreds of people.

The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 500 people were killed at al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City with many people still stuck under the rubble. 
The cause of the explosion is disputed by Hamas, who said it was the result of an Israeli airstrike. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) blamed the strike on the Islamic Jihad.
When asked earlier in the day, the IDF said it was investigating the source of the explosion, noting that the hospital is a ""highly sensitive building"" and is ""not an IDF target.""
Following an investigation, the IDF provided its findings with regard to the source of the airstrike.
""An analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the al-Ahli [Baptist] hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,"" IDF officials said. ""Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza.""

The attack caused an international summit that was initially set for Wednesday to be canceled. It was going to feature Biden, Jordan's Abdullah, Egypt’s Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
The international community continues to press for information on what caused the explosion as attacks on hospitals, schools and other civilian targets are widely criticized.

"Israeli women betrayed by UN, women’s rights groups after Hamas rape crimes",2023-11-19,Fox News,['Ruth Marks Eglash'],"The panel shared stories about their loved ones who were taken hostage by Hamas during 'FOX & Friends.'
JERUSALEM –  Women’s rights groups and officials in Israel who have been working tirelessly for the past six weeks to document cases of rape and gender-based atrocities carried out by Hamas terrorists during their mass, brutal terror attack in Israel on Oct. 7., say the United Nations is ignoring them. 
They say they have also shared much of this evidence, some of it horrifyingly graphic and all of it extremely intimate, with the United Nations and groups that protect and empower women. 
The response: Silence. 
""We’ve sent letters and shared graphic documentation,"" Sarah Weiss Maudi, a senior diplomat and legal adviser in Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Fox News Digital. ""Their silence is so deafening that it’s sickening,"" she said.
ISRAELI POLICE SAY EXTREME SEXUAL VIOLENCE, RAPE BY HAMAS TERRORISTS WAS SYSTEMATIC

Weiss Maudi, who last year became the first Israeli representative to serve as a senior adviser to the president of the 77th Session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, said that U.N. bodies, particularly U.N. Women, whose specific mandate is to champion the rights of women regardless of race or ethnicity, have simply refused to acknowledge that atrocities were committed against Israeli women – and young girls – despite much of it filmed by Hamas, and other Palestinian terrorists from Gaza, themselves.
More than 1,200 people were killed in the mass terror attack, which took place in more than 20 Israeli communities, army bases, and a mass music festival. A further 240 individuals, including women and young children, were kidnapped back to Gaza. While no victims of sexual crimes have yet to come forward directly – mainly because they were murdered, kidnapped, or are still reeling from the trauma, the Israel Police said last week that it had collected some 60,000 videos, including footage from the terrorists, victims, first responders, and CCTV, showing these gruesome crimes. Some disturbing eyewitness testimonies of gang rapes and other sexual acts have also been documented, the police said.

""What I don’t understand is that we provided very graphic and descriptive evidence of rapes, including gang rapes and the remains of semen on young girls, it was not good enough for the U.N.,"" said Weiss Maudi. ""Yet data provided by the Hamas Ministry of Health is accepted and quoted without any verification at all,"" she added.
On the U.N. Women’s website, the only reference to Israel since the Oct. 7 massacre deals with the ""devastating impact of the crisis in Gaza on women and girls,"" where Hamas’ Ministry of Health estimates that more than 11,200 people have been killed, of whom some 4,506 are said to be children and 3,027 women.
U.N. Women also details a two-day trip to Egypt by its executive director, Sima Bahous, where she called for ""immediate and unhindered humanitarian access,"" to Gaza.

""Some of them deny because they think Israelis fabricate lies,"" said Weiss Maudi. ""Others can only see these events in the context of the so called ‘occupation’ and they say ‘This is unfortunate but what did you expect was going to happen?’""
While referencing the Oct. 7 attack at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Oct. 24, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, ""It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum."" Following his remarks, there were calls for his resignation. He complained to the media that his comments had been ""distorted."" 
""I think many believe that Israeli women had this coming to them because they are seen as privileged women living good lives in southern Israel, while they claim the Israeli military is flattening Gaza,"" Weiss Maudi said, adding that many top international officials refuse to devote their energy to the Israeli female victims because they believe ""the Jewish lobby"" is supporting them and also ""why would they tell the story of a few rapes when they want to look at the bigger picture of what is happening now in Gaza?""

Anne Bayefsky, director of Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, who has followed U.N. Women closely, said it was more than that, however. 
""The fact is that U.N. Women is a phony human rights body, for which Jewish women and girls don't count,"" she said, adding that the organization ""is so twisted that it blames Israel for the violence of Palestinian men against Palestinian women, claiming that ‘structural gender discrimination... in Palestine’ means the war ‘increase[s] women’s risks to gender-based violence and food insecurity.’""
UN OFFICIAL CAUSES UPROAR OVER CLAIM THAT ISRAEL DOESN'T HAVE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST HAMAS TERRORISTS
Bayefsky added that U.N. officials, including its special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, have not only ignored that rape and gender-based crimes took place against Jewish and Israeli women on Oct. 7, but have even actively questioned whether such acts took place. 
""U.N. Women have been blasting around blood libels, including demonic characterizations of Israelis, whom they allege are responsible for the war's devastating impact on Palestinian women and girls, including pregnant Palestinians,"" she said. ""Yet on the issue of a pregnant Israeli woman whose body was slashed open and her fetus stabbed to death, or the pregnant woman believed to have given birth in Hamas captivity, they are silent.""

Dr. Cochav Elkayam-Levy, chair of Israel’s newly formed Civil Commission on October 7th Crimes by Hamas Against Women, said the reaction of international women’s organizations was ""deeply surprising and feels like a betrayal."" 
""Instead of taking care of ourselves and focusing on helping our victims and survivors, we are busy fighting these reactions and trying to prove that there were numerous cases of rape or women killed, their bodies mutilated, in the most horrible of ways,"" she said, adding, ""Gender-based violence is more than just sexual violence."" 
Elkayam-Levy, also a legal expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital, ""We have been struggling for weeks to get any recognition. Not only are they not responding or condemning what happened, they are now asking for us to provide more proof for the allegations.""

She recounted how the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), a branch of U.N. Women tasked with ""eliminating discrimination against women and girls in all areas,"" requested she prove to the committee that such atrocities took place. 
""Never in my life would I imagine that I would be standing in front of this distinguished committee to talk about gender-based war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against Israeli women and girls,"" Elkayam-Levy told CEDAW representatives on Oct. 30, according to testimony shared with Fox News Digital.

As she described to them video footage and other images of women brutalized by Hamas terrorists, Elkayam-Levy said: ""I pray that none of you, the committee’s distinguished members, will ever have to see the images I’ve seen.""
""Hamas might be now denying these war crimes, but during the attack and immediately after Hamas and its terrorists released horrific visuals of its brutal crimes, including hideous acts of torture, rape, abuse and murder of innocent women and girls, as trophies of war and killings in the most inhumane ways possible,"" she said.

""But it is not only Hamas that is denying these hideous crimes – we as Israeli women feel we are all subject of a collective international denial,"" Elkayam-Levy added. ""The evidence is undeniable. Yet, we find ourselves fighting a dual battle: one against these atrocities and another against global silence."" 
In addition, Elkayam-Levy said the refusal of international organizations to acknowledge such acts were committed against Israeli women is ""having a terrible influence on other women’s rights organizations around the world, who are failing to understand what happened and even denying it took place.""

She gave the example of a center for sexual assault at the University of Alberta, Canada, where the director signed an open letter disputing that women were raped and sexually assaulted by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. A statement released by the University of Alberta on Saturday said the director of the Sexual Assault Centre was no longer employed by the university, effective immediately.
In response to a request from Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for U.N. Women said the organization ""unequivocally condemns all forms of violence against women and girls, as well as any use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, which is a grave violation of human rights. It is never acceptable. International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law must be respected and upheld at all times.""

The spokesperson said Bahous had spoken about the issue at the Security Council’s Open Debate on Women, Peace and Security on Oct. 25, saying, ""Every act of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence, is unequivocally condemned, irrespective of the nationality, identity, race or religion of the victims.""
The organization said an independent commission of inquiry had already started ""collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes committed by all sides since 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched a complex attack on Israel and Israeli forces responded with airstrikes in Gaza.""

Israel’s hunt for Hamas terror group leader Yahya Sinwar: ‘Dead man walking’,2023-10-17,Fox News,['Ruth Marks Eglash'],"Jerusalem Post Editor-In-Chief Avi Mayer tells ‘America Reports’ that Hamas’ ideology is infused with hatred and the genocidal desire to end all Jews.
JERUSALEM, Israel – If there’s one clear objective of Israel’s war in Gaza right now it is this: To hunt down and assassinate Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. 
Referred to by Israel as the Butcher of Khan Younis for his violent and cruel torture methods against his enemies, both Israeli and Palestinian, Sinwar, 60, is widely seen as being behind the massacre of Israeli civilians carried out by thousands of Hamas militants on Oct. 7.
The attack, in which 1,400 people are now known to have been killed, with a further 200 missing and likely being held hostage inside the Gaza Strip, is the worst against Jews since the Holocaust. Civilian men, women and children were not only murdered but, according to multiple eyewitness reports also brutalized, raped and even decapitated.
""That man is in our sights,"" Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht told journalists over the weekend. ""Sinwar is the leader of Hamas in Gaza and he’s a dead man walking.""

""We will get to him, however long it takes… and this war could be long,"" he said.
Sinwar, who is believed to be somewhere in the Palestinian enclave but hidden deep underground in the warren of tunnels Hamas uses to transport weapons and fighters and where they may even be keeping the hostages, was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp when the area was part of Egypt.
According to multiple sources, he was always a militant activist and joined Hamas not long after its founding in 1987. Two years later he was arrested by Israel for his involvement in the abduction and killing of two Israelis, as well as the torturing and murder of four Palestinians he considered to be collaborators. 
Sentenced to life in prison, Sinwar ended up serving 22 years in an Israeli jail and was eventually released as part of a prisoner exchange for the abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.
""Sinwar has been active since the early days of Hamas,"" Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told Fox News Digital. ""In jail, he became a prominent leader of Hamas prisoners and was a very influential figure among all Palestinian prisoners.""

Michael said that during his time in jail Sinwar learned to speak Hebrew fluently and knows Israeli society very well. 
""He is religious, not necessarily in practice but in religious extremism,"" he said. ""In his soul and in mentality, he is a living martyr, not afraid to die or sacrifice himself. He is extreme and believes that he can lead the Palestinian people to destroy Israel."" 
""He does not have a Western way of thinking,"" Michael continued. ""When he talks about the destruction of the Zionist project and raising the caliphate from Marrakesh to Bangladesh, he is not even talking about in his lifetime but in future generations.""

FORMER ISRAELI SOLDIER SUGGESTS HOSTAGE RESCUE OPERATIONS BEHIND DELAY IN GROUND INVASION OF GAZA
After being returned to Gaza as part of the Shalit deal, Sinwar became a popular leader in Hamas, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, and in 2017 was elected by secret ballot to replace the incumbent political leader, Ismail Haniyeh.
Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at the Dayan Center in Tel Aviv University, described Sinwar as part of the second generation of Hamas leaders and said he has the potential of leading the whole movement, not just its affairs in Gaza. 
""Compared to Haniyeh and [former political leader Khaled] Mashal, Sinwar is very charismatic,"" said Milshtein, adding that he is also far more hardline and radical than the previous Hamas leaders. 
""He believes that he was born to promote jihad and kill the infidels, that is his approach,"" he said. ""He comes from the periphery of Palestinian society, from a refugee camp, unlike the others who like to wear suits and ties.""

Milshtein said Sinwar was willing to take the conflict to another level and was unlikely to run away from Israel’s approaching military. 
""I do not see him running away, giving up or handing himself over, he will fight until he dies, that is the kind of leader he is,"" said Milshtein. ""Sinwar has only left Gaza once or twice in the past six years and that was only to Egypt. He does not know much about the rest of the world or about diplomatic relations, he is focused on jihad."" 
This is not the first time that Sinwar is in Israel’s sights. In 2018, following the announcement by President Donald Trump that he would move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, mass protests broke out in Gaza along the border fence with Israel. Known as the Great March of Return, Israel said Sinwar was instigating the unrest and encouraging thousands of Palestinians to try and break through into Israel to harm civilians.

In terms of the Oct. 7 attack, which was led by Hamas’ elite Nukhba force, Israel believes Sinwar and other Hamas leaders, such as military commander Mohammad Deif, have been preparing for the attack for more than two years. There is evidence that Sinwar purposely misled regional partners such as Egypt and Qatar into believing that he was more focused on relieving the humanitarian crisis for the enclave’s 2.1 million residents than drawing Israel into a war. 
Retired Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, the Israeli army spokesman, told Fox News Digital that the army had ""no doubt"" Sinwar was the ""mastermind of this massacre.""
""He coordinated the entire institution of Hamas, the government, and the military wing,"" said Lerner. ""He is the financier, the instructor and he gave the ultimate green light to carry this out."" 
Sinwar, he said, was at the top of the Israeli military’s list of targets. 
""He is the figurehead,"" said Lerner. ""Although there are many others that were involved in the butchering of our civilians. We are collecting and currently analyzing visuals found on the bodycams carried by the Hamas terrorists during the attack.""

As to whether Israel will be able to reach its greatest enemy, Michael told Fox News Digital that ""as long as we stay determined and do not surrender under the pressure of the international community and as long as we are patient, then there is a high probability Israel will be able to get its hands on Sinwar.""
""Sinwar will not remain alive for too much longer,"" he said.

Average Palestinian in Gaza surviving on only 2 pieces of bread per day: UN human rights official,2023-11-04,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"'Special Report' All-Star Panel discusses growing pressure for President Biden and his administration to order a ceasefire in Gaza.
The average Palestinian in Gaza is living on just two pieces of Arabic bread, the Gaza director for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said Friday, highlighting the humanitarian crisis and the dire rarity of resources residents are experiencing as the war between Israel and Hamas continues.
Thomas White, Director of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), said the Palestinian refugee agency is supporting about 89 bakeries across Gaza, aiming to get bread to 1.7 million people — only barely needing basic needs.
White also said he traveled ""the length and breadth of Gaza in the last few weeks"" and described the place as a ""scene of death and destruction.""
No place is safe now, he said, as civilians remain in the crossfire of Israel’s campaign of vengeance against the Hamas terror group, which launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, slaughtering 1,400 people in border towns and communities on Oct. 7.

White said the bread, made from flour the United Nations had stockpiled in the region, is still not the most pressing need for those who remain in Gaza as residents plead for drinkable water: ""Now people are beyond looking for bread. It’s looking for water.""
U.N. deputy Mideast coordinator Lynn Hastings, the humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said only one of three water supply lines from Israel is operational.

""Many people are relying on brackish or saline ground water, if at all,"" she said.
Another major problem emerging out of Gaza is the lack of fuel, essential for the functioning of backup generators, which have been essential to keep hospitals, water desalination plants, food production facilities and other essential services operating
U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths also said intense negotiations are taking place among authorities from Israel, Egypt, the United States and United Nations on allowing fuel to enter Gaza.
""We must allow these supplies reliably, repetitively and dependently into Gaza,"" Griffiths said.

Hospitals, institutions and water and electricity distribution centers ""are one by one grinding to a halt as fuel supplies run out,"" Hastings added.
White said close to 600,000 people are sheltering in 149 UNRWA facilities, most of them schools, but the agency has lost contact with many in the north, where Israel is carrying intense ground and air operations following Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attacks.

White noted the U.N. cannot meet the needs of those who remain in their facilities: ""At last count, 38 people have died in our shelters. I fear that with the fighting going on in the north right now, that number is going to grow significantly.""
Griffiths, the humanitarian chief, said 72 UNRWA staff members had been killed since Oct. 7. ""I think it’s the highest number of U.N. staff lost in a conflict,"" he said.
More than 9,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and the death toll is expected to rise once buildings are cleared and rubble is taken away.

The United States does not officially support a ceasefire, as President Biden has repeatedly affirmed Israel's right to self-defense against Hamas. Biden has recently shifted his tone, amid pressure from progressive groups and world leaders, to express support for a humanitarian ""pause.""

More than 500 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic jihad targets have been struck overnight as part of a massive blitz on the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Air Force announced Monday. 
In a series of social media posts, the Israeli Air Force provided some details, including saying that one of the numerous multi-story buildings that was hit was the ""residence of Ruhi Mashtaa, secretary of the Hamas and part of the organization's decision-making group,"" which ""contained a Hamas terror command center, from which he helped direct the infiltration into Israel."" 
""Seven Hamas command centers and an Islamic Jihad command center were struck,"" the Israeli Air Force said. ""A building that was operationally used by a senior operative of the Hamas terrorist organization's naval forces was also targeted."" 
""Two Hamas operational assets were struck by an aircraft, one of them was located inside a mosque,"" they added. ""An Islamic Jihad asset located in a building in which terrorists operate and live was also targeted.""

Hours later, fresh rocket attacks were reported in the southern Israeli city of Ashdod. 
""We saw multiple impacts across this heavily populated area,"" Fox News Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst said, while reporting from the scene. ""We took cover next to a building, but you could see the rockets coming off the Gaza Strip and slamming into buildings in this community.""
It was not immediately clear whether the attacks were carried out in retaliation for the overnight siege on the Gaza Strip.

"Democrats support Palestinians over Israel, GOP overwhelmingly stands with US ally: 2023 poll",2023-10-10,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"Dozens of people in Israel were kidnapped by terrorists in a mass terrorist attack.

More Democrats in the United States support Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank than Israel, the closest U.S. ally in the Middle East, according to a 2023 poll.
Democratic sympathies for Palestinians has increased over the last decade, and a Gallup poll published in March 2023 found their affinity toward the Palestinians finally eclipsed their support of Israel, 49% to 38%.
The attitudes from March reflected a continued decline in Israeli support, from 40% to 38% and an 11-point surge of support for Palestinian people, from 38% to 49%.
The 38% support for Israel was a historic low for the Democratic Party, as is the 13% of Democrats who said they do not favor one side over the other.

Meanwhile, across the proverbial aisle, Republicans overwhelmingly support Israel with 78% supporting the Middle Eastern ally. Only 11% expressed sympathies more with the Palestinians.
The nearly 8-in-10 support for Israel has been steadfast since 2003, dipping only once over the past 20 years below 70%.
More Independents support Israel (49%) than Palestinians (32%). Nineteen percent said they did not favor one side over the other, according to Gallup.

The recent poll has resurfaced as a war has erupted between Israel and Hamas, a terror group that governs Gaza, a territory given to Palestinian people in 2005 in exchange for peace.
Hamas terrorists launched a brutal and surprising assault on towns and villages just across the Gaza-Israel border, massacring more than 700 of people in a single day.
The violence continued with Hamas firing more than 1,500 rockets into Israel, striking Tel Avi, Jerusalem and other cities.

Israeli Idan Rakovsky spoke to Fox News Digital after his brother-in-law, Avidan Tordjman, was killed by Hamas members in the infamous October 7 attacks. He criticized international media — both left-wing and right-wing — for its treatment of the Israel-Hamas war.

""How would the average American, or Canadian, or British, or French — doesn't matter now — How would he or she respond to [an event] 20 times 9/11 in one day?"" Rakovsky said of the October 7 attacks by Hamas that left at least 1,400 Israelis killed, with at least 199 others being taken hostage by Hamas into Gaza.
""That's what we're going through right now,"" Rakovsky said, again comparing the shock and tragedy of the Hamas attacks on Israelis and other citizens at a festival on the Gaza-Israel border to 9/11. ""So seeing the coverage outside of Israel is very, very hard,"" he said.
""I can tell you that we are already used to it, unfortunately,"" he said. ""So it doesn't really bother us anymore. We know that Israel is strong for itself and that we have no one to rely on [but] ourselves. And that's that's fine with us. And that's why we need to be as strong as we can.""

Rakovsky responded directly to the media coverage of the Gaza hospital bombing, which has sparked intense debate online as outlets, including CBS and The New York Times, received criticism for suggesting that Israel was to blame.

President Biden and the leaders of Western allies reiterated support for Israel's right to defend itself on Sunday amid attacks from Hamas terrorists while also urging the Jewish State to protect civilians and follow international humanitarian law.

Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, France President Emmanuel Macron, Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italy Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak released a joint statement Sunday welcoming the release of two hostages by Hamas and calling on remaining hostages to be freed as well.
""The leaders reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians,"" the statement read. ""They welcomed the release of two hostages and called for the immediate release of all remaining hostages. They committed to close coordination to support their nationals in the region, in particular those wishing to leave Gaza.""

""The leaders welcomed the announcement of the first humanitarian convoys to reach Palestinians in need in Gaza and committed to continue coordinating with partners in the region to ensure sustained and safe access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance required to meet humanitarian needs,"" the statement continued. ""The leaders committed to continue close diplomatic coordination, including with key partners in the region, to prevent the conflict from spreading, preserve stability in the Middle East, and work toward a political solution  and durable peace.""

More activity took place at Israel's northern border with Lebanon overnight Sunday as tensions escalate with Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah.
The IDF said Monday morning that its forces struck four Hezbollah terrorist cells on the Lebanese border and some of the group's infrastructure, including a military compound and an observation post, in Lebanon.
Skirmishes along the Israel-Lebanon border have become more frequent in recent days as many are concerned that a second front with Hezbollah may emerge in Israel’s war with Hamas.


In response to the rising concerns, the U.S. State Department alerted on X, formerly Twitter, Sunday night that American citizens should leave Lebanon immediately due to an ""unpredictable security situation.""
""U.S. citizens who wish to depart Lebanon should leave now, due to the unpredictable security situation,"" the post by the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs read. ""There are still commercial flights available, but there is reduced capacity.""


The State of Israel responded to a social media post by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg Friday in support of Palestinians.

""The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected,"" the 20-year-old posted to X, formerly known as Twitter.
Israel's X account, managed by the Middle Eastern country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, did not mince words as it fired back just over an hour after Thunberg's second version of the tweet.
"".@GretaThunberg, Hamas doesn’t use sustainable materials for their rockets which have BUTCHERED innocent Israelis. The victims of the Hamas massacre could have been your friends. Speak up,"" Israel posted.

Thunberg's original post included a picture of her with three other activists with signs that read, ""Free Palestine,"" ""Climate Justice Now,"" ""This Jew Stands With Palestine"" and ""Stand With Gaza."" It was deleted because it included a blue octopus that had a frowning face and was sitting on one of the activists’ legs, which she said she had not realized could be viewed as an antisemitic symbol.
Moments later, Thunberg shared a nearly identical photo – the same four people holding the same four signs – this time with the stuffed animal cut out of the photo.
 ""The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings,"" Thunberg explained.

A former State Department official resigned last week over the Biden administration’s response to the Israel-Hamas war.
Josh Paul, the former director of congressional and public affairs at the department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, announced his resignation on Oct. 18 in a two-page letter posted to LinkedIn, stating he couldn’t stay because of a ""policy disagreement"" with the United States’ ""continued lethal assistance to Israel.""

""Let me be clear: Hamas' attack on Israel was not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities. I also believe that potential escalations by Iran-linked groups such as Hezbollah, or by Iran itself, would be a further cynical exploitation of the existing tragedy. But I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response, and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people - and is not in the long term American interest,"" Paul wrote in part.

""This Administration's response - and much of Congress' as well - is an impulsive reaction built on confirmation bias, political convenience, intellectual bankruptcy, and bureaucratic inertia.  That is to say, it is immensely disappointing, and entirely unsurprising. Decades of the same approach have shown that security for peace leads to neither security, nor to peace. The fact is, blind support for one side is destructive in the long term to the interests of the people on both sides.  I fear we are repeating the same mistakes we have made these past decades, and I decline to be a part of it for longer.""
Paul, who worked 11 years for the State Department, told the New York Times ""legal guardrails"" were failing after Israel cut off water, food, electricity and medicine to Gaza after Hamas terrorists killed 1,400 Israelis and kidnapped hundreds more.

The Biden administration announced a $100 million humanitarian aid package for Palestinians last week and requested roughly $15 billion in aid for Israel from the U.S. Congress.

Some Hamas terrorists killed during the October 7 attack that marked the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war were carrying instructions about chemical bombs, Israeli officials say.
The instructions were reportedly about cyanide-based chemical bombs, according to Israeli intelligence reviewed by Axios. The information was found on USB devices that the terrorists were carrying.
The USBs were found on the bodies of killed Hamas fighters who invaded Kibbutz Be’eri in Southern Israel when the war began.
Israeli officials have told their embassies that the Hamas terrorists were expected to ""conduct attacks in a similar way that ISIS tried to do.""
""This finding points to an intention by Hamas to use chemical weapons as part of its terror attack against civilians,"" Israel reported in a cable to its embassies.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., criticized Iran for allegedly ""giving the green light"" to Hamas before the terrorist group began attacking Israel earlier this month.
Speaking from Tel Aviv on Sunday, the Connecticut senator warned Iranian leaders to not involve themselves with Hezbollah, another terrorist group.
""If you're thinking about giving the green light to Hezbollah, as you did to Hamas - don’t,"" Blumenthal said.

It is still unclear to what extent Iranian officials helped Hamas terrorists plan or carry out their attack against Israel, which began on October 7.
Senior White House official John Kirby has maintained that there is not a ""direct link"" between Iran and the Hamas attacks against Israel, though Iran funds, trains, and has been linked to the terrorist group in the past.
Kirby, who acts as the National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications, has asserted that the Biden administration has not ""turned a blind eye"" to Iran's influence.
""We're obviously recognize that there's broad complicity here by the Iranians, I mean, because of the longstanding support to Hamas,"" Kirby explained on October 11. ""Hamas wouldn't have been able to function at all had it not been for propping up by the Iranian regime."" 

""But we haven't seen any specific evidence that tells us they were wittingly involved in the planning or involved in the resourcing and the training that went into this very complex set of attacks over the weekend,"" he added.

Blinken appeared on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" to discuss the latest developments in the war, which began on October 7. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the northern part of the Gaza Strip amid dangerous conditions.
""To date, at least, Hamas has blocked [U.S. citizens] from leaving, showing once again its total disregard for civilians of any kind who are who are stuck in Gaza,"" Blinken said.
Host Margaret Brennan also pressed the official on why the U.S. is not advocating for a ceasefire, referencing Israel's airstrikes towards Gaza. Blinken said that he expects ""more will follow today and the day after that.""

""We want to make sure that we have sustained delivery of food, medicine, water, the things that people need,"" Blinken explained. ""At the same time, I said something a minute ago that we have to remember. Israel has to do everything it can to make sure this doesn't happen again.""
""Freezing things in place where they are now would allow Hamas to remain where it is and to repeat what it's done sometime in the future. No country could accept that,"" he added.


Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Fox News host Shannon Bream that China, Russia and Iran comprise the new ""axis of evil"" as the wars in Ukraine and Israel continue.
During a ""Fox News Sunday"" appearance, McConnell asserted that the world is the most endangered its ever been in his lifetime – even more than during the Cold War.

""You have to respond to conditions that actually exist that are a threat to the United States. The Iranians are a threat to us as well. And so, this is an emergency,"" the Kentucky senator explained. ""It’s an emergency that we step up and deal with this axis of evil – China, Russia, Iran – because it’s an immediate threat to the United States.""
McConnell then questioned if the United States will take on a leadership role during the tense geopolitical situation.
""The question is, is America going to lead?"" McConnell asked. ""I think the Biden administration sent the wrong signal and they had the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. I think that was like giving a green light to Putin to go into Ukraine.""

""And we see that Iran, principal sponsor of terrorism, sending drones to the Russians and attacking – Hezbollah and in this particular situation, Hamas – attacking the Israelis with drones. So it’s all connected,"" he added. ""You can’t separate out one part of it and say we’re only gonna deal with this. It’s all connected.""

President Biden spoke with multiple world leaders on Sunday as the war between Israel and Hamas continues in the Middle East.

The White House announced on Sunday that Biden had a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the latest updates about the war. In a statement, the White House said that the leaders ""affirmed that there will now be continued flow"" of critical assistance into Gaza and agreed to keep in touch.
""The President expressed appreciation for Israel’s support in helping to accommodate the release of two American hostages,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The leaders discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all the remaining hostages taken by Hamas – including U.S. citizens – and to provide for safe passage for U.S. citizens and other civilians in Gaza who wish to depart.""
Biden also hopped on a group call with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, along with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

Hamas began attacking Israel during a surprise terrorist assault on October 7, the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. At least 1,500 people in Israel have been killed since, and around 212 others were captured and taken to Gaza.
The Hamas-run health ministry estimated that more than 4,600 people have been killed in Gaza so far. The Israeli government says that around 700,000 people in northern Gaza have fled the overcrowded territory.

Israel's government security service has created a new unit devoted to hunting down and eliminating all members of Hamas who played a role in the October 7 assault on Israel.

The service, Shin Bet, has named the new unit Nili, an acronym in Hebrew for ""The Eternity of Israel Will Not Lie,"" according to the Jerusalem Post. The force is specifically targeted against a Hamas force known as Nukhba or ""Elite."" The Nukhba reportedly infiltrated Israel on October 7 and conducted mass killings at civilian and IDF outposts before returning to Gaza.
The unit comprises both intelligence officials and field operators, and it will reportedly function separately from Shin Bet's other units.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refered to Hamas as ""bloody monsters"" and has vowed to destroy them. The IDF appears poised for a ground invasion of Gaza, but no order has come down to move forward.

The IDF has already carried out strikes killing roughly half a dozen senior Hamas leaders. An airstrike Sunday morning killed Hamas' deputy commander of its rocket array, according to Israel.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he had rarely seen a group of U.S. senators so ""moved"" and ""inspired"" than he did Sunday morning. He assured Israel that it has his full support in its war against Hamas terrorists.
He went on to offer his support for the Palestinian people, who he says are also victims of Hamas.
Each of the senators also offered a warning to Iran not to intervene in the conflict, either directly or through its terrorist proxies like Hezbollah.

Second convoy of aid has entered Gaza, Egyptian media says


A convoy of 17 trucks crossed the Egyptian border into Gaza carrying aid for civilians amid Israel's war against Hamas on Sunday, according to Egyptian state media.
The convoy would be the second aid package to arrive in Gaza since Israel imposed a blockade on the region. Israeli first announced last week that it would allow Egypt to deliver supplies.
The report comes as the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says it will run out of fuel in Gaza by Wednesday. It is unclear whether the 2nd convoy carried any fuel, as the first did not.
Israel has appeared poised for an invasion of Gaza for more than a week, but no order has come down to begin a ground operation.

Bill Maher mocks Ivy League schools for ‘indoctrination’ and anti-Israel hate

HBO host Bill Maher skewered America’s Ivy League universities Friday night, accusing them of being hotbeds of ""indoctrination"" after many student groups have been hammering Israel in the wake of Hamas’ deadly attack against that country.
Citing antisemitic rallies and statements cropping up in academia following the attack, the ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" host advised that young people should avoid attending these schools.

At the outset of the segment, Maher stated, ""As an Ivy League graduate who knows the value of a liberal education, I have one piece of advice for the youth of America: Don’t go to college.""
Showing images of Pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel demonstrations at Harvard University, the comedian continued, ""And if you absolutely have to go, don’t go to an elite college, because as recent events have shown, it just makes you stupid.""

Maher stated that the tragedy in Israel revealed ""how higher education has become indoctrination into a stew of bad ideas, among them the simplistic notion that the world is a binary place where everyone is either an oppressor or oppressed, in the case of Israel, oppressors being babies and bubbes.""
The host was referring to Palestinian supporters on these campuses that have insisted that the Hamas attack on October 7 was Israel’s fault for oppressing Palestinians.

Israeli forces released footage of their first-ever use of the ""Iron Sting"" in an operation on Sunday.

Israeli forces released footage of their first-ever use of the ""Iron Sting"" in an operation on Sunday.
The army used the weapons system in conjuction with the Israeli Air Force, describing it as a ""innovative and accurate mortar bomb."" The dense urban environments of Gaza and the West Bank ensure that the accuracy of Israel's air strikes is a top priority.



The munition uses both laser and GPS guidance systems to guide toward the target, minimizing the risk of collateral damage.
Israeli forces have conducted thousands of air strikes in Gaza and the West Bank following Hamas' unprecedented attack on October 7.
While the IDF has made clear preparations for a potential ground assault into Gaza, no order to move forward has been given.

Israel hits Hamas compound hidden under mosque in West Bank


The Israeli military took out a militant compound hidden under a mosque in the West Bank early Sunday morning, the IDF announced.
The military says the militants had used the compound beneath the al-Ansar Mosque, in Jenin to coordinate attacks against Israel. It said militants with both Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad had used the facility, Reuters reported.
""Intel was recently received which indicated that the terrorists, (who) were neutralized, were organizing an imminent terror attack,"" the military said in a statement.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said that one person was killed in the strike and three others were wounded.

Hamas and other terror groups in the region are infamous for placing key command posts and supply caches underneath civilian thoroughfares like mosques, hospitals and schools.



Israel is targeting every terrorist organization based in Gaza, and not simply Hamas, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said Saturday.
Conricus says Israel is targeting ""everything related to Hamas combat capabilities,"" including infrastructure and logistics targets. Israeli operations are including attacks on the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which Conricus described as ""smaller, but more radical"" than Hamas.
Hamas and PIJ are only two of multiple terrorist organizations operating within Gaza. Conricus says the IDF expects to meet resistance if it moves forward with a ground invasion of Gaza, specifically citing the threat of tunnel systems.

Nevertheless, Conricus said that Hamas are ultimately cowards who routinely hide behind ""and under"" civilians for protection.

Israeli soldier celebrates wedding days after he's shot and his brother goes missing in action

An Israeli soldier celebrated his wedding little over a week after he was wounded battling Hamas terrorists and his younger brother was declared missing in action.
Amid grief and uncertainty, Yonatan and Galya Tzvi, both 24, tied the knot in a scaled-down ceremony that had been planned months before Hamas terrorists stormed into Israel Oct. 7 and slaughtered more than 1,400 people.

""It was obviously a very bittersweet wedding and there were tears,"" the groom's father, Rabbi Doron Perez, told Fox News Digital. ""But somehow we were able to celebrate, and it was also very happy.""
When fighting broke out, Yonatan, a soldier in a paratrooper brigade, was dispatched to Sderot then to an army base in Nahal Oz, less than two miles from the border with Gaza.
Hamas terrorists had breached the security fence and taken over the army base.
Yonatan's 22-year-old brother Daniel, a tank commander, happened to be stationed there when fighting broke out.
""When [Yonatan] went into the base, some of the tanks were missing. He knew where Daniel’s tank was parked, and it wasn't there,"" Doron said.

The Israeli military should expect high levels of civilian casualties if it plans to move foward with a ground invasion of Gaza in the comind days, Gen. David Petraeus says.

The former CIA director made the comments on Fox News this weekend, saying the task of rooting out Hamas from Gaza will be a difficult one.
""I believe the Israeli Defense Forces are capable of destroying Hamas, but there will be considerable casualties for the Israelies, for innocent civilians, and considerable damage and destruction to civilian infrastructure,"" Petraeus said.
""It is inevitable that in this kind of very tough, urban fighting that there will be that kind of destruction and that level of civilian casualties,"" he added.

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says Israeli air strikes killed yet another senior member of Hamas overnight Sunday.


IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says Israeli air strikes killed yet another senior member of Hamas overnight Sunday.
Strikes in the Gaza strip killed dozens of Hamas targets throughout the night, Israel said, including the deputy commander of the group's rocket array. Hamas has fired thousands of rockets into Israel since the conflict began on October 7.
""We are increasing the attacks in the Gaza Strip in order to reduce the threats to our forces in preparation for the next phase of the war,” Hagari said.
“We will go to the next stage under the best conditions for the IDF and in accordance with the decision of the political echelon,” he added.
Hagari did not name the commander.

Israel focused on destroying Hamas despite ceasefire calls: 'No other option'

On a tour of southern Israel aimed at boosting morale among troops preparing for a likely ground operation inside Gaza, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant promised to lead Israel to a decisive victory against Hamas.
""We will be precise and forceful, and we will keep going until we fulfill our mission,"" Gallant stated.

What exactly that mission is has been clearly echoed throughout Israel’s military ranks up to its political leadership over the last two weeks since an elite unit of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel.
After the murder of 1,400 people, civilians and soldiers and the kidnapping of 210 people, Israel has said it will not stop this war until Hamas, its people and its infrastructure are wiped out.
Voices around the world have begun questioning whether Israel’s response is ""proportionate,"" calling for restraint as the civilian death toll in Gaza rises and demanding a cease-fire before this conflict drags in other, more nefarious, regional players.

But Israelis remain steadfast, believing there is no choice — ""It’s either them or us."" There is no room in the region for both.

The son of a founding Hamas leader broke his silence on his decision to denounce the terrorist group after he turned on his own family and converted to Christianity when he saw the horrors of the group's reign firsthand.
Mosab Hassan Yousef, who spied in favor of the Israelis and sought asylum in the U.S., spoke out on his decision to leave the life of terror behind during ""FOX & Friends.""

""I was born at the heart of Hamas leadership… and I know them very well. They don't care for the Palestinian people. They do not regard the human life,"" Yousef told Brian Kilmeade Thursday.
""I saw their brutality firsthand back in 1996 when I spent about a year and a half in Megiddo Prison… They killed so many Palestinian people at that point, and this is when I decided that I cannot be together with this movement.""
""I had to be honest with myself. Even though Hamas gave me advantages…. I was like a prince in that world… but I did not like them,"" he continued. ""I turned against even my own blood… because this is how much I did not like Hamas, and today, 25 years later, they are the rulers of Gaza, and we see what they are capable of doing.""

""We think that this is not a war for only Jews against Hamas,"" Shadi Khaloul
 said. ""It's the fight of light against darkness.""
Hamas launched a surprise invasion on Oct. 7, killing 1,400 Israelis, including civilians. Brutal details have come to light in the following days, showing massacres and beheadings of women and children, with Israeli officials describing signs of torture and abuse.
With the Jewish state preparing to send troops into Gaza as part of its resulting war against Hamas, more than 300,000 IDF reservists of all backgrounds had been called up as of Oct. 9, according to Israel's chief military spokesperson Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari.

Dozens of Hollywood A-listers wrote an open letter addressed to President Biden this week urging him and other world leaders to push for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.
Celebrities including Academy Award winner Joaquin Phoenix, actress Cate Blanchett, comedian Jon Stewart, and 52 others signed the letter calling for peace between the Israeli and Palestinian people.
As noted in Variety, their letter stated, ""We ask that, as President of the United States, you call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the last week and a half – a number any person of conscience knows is catastrophic. We believe all life is sacred, no matter faith or ethnicity and we condemn the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians.""
The letter continued, ""We urge your administration, and all world leaders, to honor all of the lives in the Holy Land and call for and facilitate a ceasefire without delay – an end to the bombing of Gaza, and the safe release of hostages.""

Fox News reviewed Israeli footage of a captured Hamas terrorist discussing the group's savage October 7 attack on Israel.
Fox News’ Trey Yingst reported on the video of a Hamas fighter. The terrorist acknowled that in Islam, people are not supposed to kill women, children and the elderly, despite commanders’ orders.
The militant said Hamas members ""became animals"" when they invaded Southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people.

Two astronauts aboard the International Space Station told Fox News their view of Earth without borders and living alongside people from other nations has helped them feel a sense of unity, even as the Israel-Hamas war rages.
""One of the things we experience up here is a different perspective of the world of our planet,"" European Space Agency astronaut Andreas Mogensen told Fox News. ""A lot of people call it the overview effect.""
""We see the Earth as a single planet that we all share together,"" he continued. ""You don't see borders between countries, and so you get an idea that perhaps borders are something artificial.""

Though astronauts may not be able to differentiate between different countries from space, territorial border disputes over the Gaza Strip between Palestinians and Israelis have been ongoing for decades. After Hamas — the ruling party in Gaza — invaded Israel and murdered over 1,400 Israelis on Oct. 7, the Jewish nation declared war on the Islamic terrorist group and launched retaliatory strikes.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says he cancel student visas and deport foreign nationals who express support for Hamas in the U.S. if he is elected president.
DeSantis made the comments Friday while speaking at a campaign event in Iowa. The White House hopeful discussed his plans to remove Hamas-supporting foreign nationals attending U.S. colleges and universities from the country as many pro-Palestinian student groups at various institutions across the nation release statements and organize demonstrations endorsing Hamas' largest attack against Israel in decades.
""You see students demonstrating in our country in favor of Hamas,"" DeSantis said. ""Remember, some of them are foreigners.""

DeSantis said he will be ""canceling your visa, and I’m sending you home"" if he wins the presidency in 2024.
Fellow Republican presidential candidate and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said at the same event in Iowa that, if elected president, he would withhold Pell Grants from universities that failed to eliminate antisemitism on their campuses.

IDF says Hamas is 'killing their own people' with string of Gaza rocket misfires


A steady stream of rocket misfires by Hamas and Islamic Jihad have resulted in the deaths of several Palestinians since the war between Israel and Iran-backed terrorists first began earlier this month, according to one Israeli defense official.
""They are killing their own people,"" Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said Saturday.
Hagari noted that one-fifth of the rockets that have been fired by Hamas and Islamic Jihad have missed intended targets and landed inside Gaza, killing civilians. That number, Hagari said, amounts to more than 550 rockets.

The comments from Hagari came roughly four days after the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was struck by an errant rocket. The blast reportedly left hundreds dead. Hamas initially claimed the hospital was attacked in an Israeli strike; Israel countered after an investigation that it was hit by an errant missile launched by terrorists in Gaza.

The U.S. has plans to deploy further missiles sytems to the Middle East as Israel and Hamas continue to exchange fire this weekend.
The U.S. credited to additional deployments to ""escalations"" in the region by Iran. Iran and its proxy terrorist group, Hezbollah, have threatened to join the war against Israel for weeks.
The U.S. has pressured them to stay out of the conflict, deploying two air craft carrier groups to the Eastern Mediterranean in a clear threat of full U.S. involvement.
The U.S. has put at least 2,000 troops on high alert in the region, though President Biden says Israel has not requested direct U.S. assistance.

Israeli forces conduct tank raid in Gaza ahead of expected invasion,2023-10-26,Fox News,['Chris Pandolfo'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst has the latest from southern Israel.
Israeli troops and tanks conducted a ground raid in northern Gaza overnight into Thursday, Israel Defense Forces said, attacking Hamas targets.
The operation was meant to ""prepare the battlefield"" for an expected ground operation in the Palestinian territory after two-week long airstrike campaign, a military spokesman said.
Additionally, IDF made 60 arrests in the West Bank, of which 46 where Hamas members. Since the start of the war on Oct. 7, about 1,000 wanted individuals have been arrested, IDF said.
The Israel-Hamas war, now in its 20th day, has exacted devastating casualties on both sides. In the initial attack on Israel, terrorists with the Islamic group Hamas infiltrated the Jewish state and killed at least 1,400 Israeli men, women and children in the most brutal ways imaginable, many tortured and raped first. Israeli officials say as many as 224 people were taken captive back into Gaza and are now being held hostage by Hamas. The military says 309 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the start of the war.

At least 10 Americans are feared to be among the 224 people held captive by Hamas. 
The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza claimed Wednesday that more than 750 people were killed over the past 24 hours, higher than the 704 killed the previous day, the Associated Press reported. The death toll reported by Hamas could not be independently verified, and the ministry does not distinguish between Palestinian civilians and terrorist combatants. By comparison, 2,251 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the entire six-week-long war in 2014, according to U.N. figures.
The Israeli military has urged Palestinian civilians to flee areas in the Gaza Strip where Hamas has placed infrastructure to fire rockets at Israel. These military targets are embedded within civilian buildings and U.S. officials have said Hamas uses the Palestinian people as human shields. 
During the overnight raid, soldiers killed fighters and destroyed militant infrastructure and anti-tank missile launching positions, the military said. It said no Israeli were wounded. There was no immediate confirmation of any Palestinian casualties.

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a military spokesman, said the raids were ""part of our preparations for the next stages of the war."" 
The military also reported it executed some 250 airstrikes across Gaza in the past 24 hours, targeting tunnel shafts, rocket launchers and other militant infrastructure.
The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has warned that lack of fuel, food and medical aid for Palestinians caught in the crossfire will make the humanitarian crisis there worse.
The Gaza Strip is home to 2.3 million Palestinians, and about 1.4 million of them have been displaced from their homes by the war. Many are staying in crowded U.N. shelters as Israel's relentless airstrikes continue.

Days ago, Israel permitted more than 60 trucks to enter Gaza with humanitarian aid from Egypt, but U.N. officials and aid workers say the limited supplies is insufficient. Israel has refused to permit fuel to be delivered to Gaza, which is needed to power generators, fearing that Hamas will confiscate it and launch more rockets at Israeli residential areas. 
The rising death toll will increase if Israel begins a full-scale ground operation in Gaza. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his country Wednesday evening during a primetime address that its cabinet is ""deciding"" on the timing for a possible ground incursion into the Gaza Strip. 
""The goal, the timing of what the Israel Defense Forces is going to do is based on the cabinet and the chief of staff and the cabinet are deciding,"" Netanyahu said. ""And when we get into Gaza as we go on, we will exact the highest price from these murderers for what they've done."" 
Netanyahu said Israel has two goals in the war – to ""destroy Hamas and all its infrastructure"" and to ""do everything that's possible to bring our hostages back home.""

Pramila Jayapal clashed with CNN host Dana Bash on Sunday after she questioned why progressive women have been hesitant to speak out against Hamas' use of sexual violence in their attacks against Israel.
Actress Gal Gadot called out the silence on Hamas' use of sexual violence on Sunday in a post on social media, arguing that ""the world has failed the women of October 7th."" 
""We claim we stand against rape, violence against women. We will not let women be victimized and then silenced. We say we believe women, stand with women, speak out for women.""
She said the world has failed to call the situation what it is, ""an urgent emergency that demands a decisive response.""

""This is our moment as women and allies of women to act.

Biden puts condition on humanitarian aid to Gaza as Israel allows Egypt to deliver supplies,2023-10-19,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"FOX News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the president's trip on 'Special Report.'
President Biden has placed a condition on humanitarian aid going into the Gaza Strip, as Israel said Wednesday it will allow Egypt to deliver limited supplies for civilians. The aid will be the first assistance given to Gaza since Israel imposed a punishing 10-day siege on the territory.
The announcement to allow water, food and other supplies happened after President Biden visited Israel Wednesday hoping to prevent a wider conflict in the region. During his one-day visit to Israel, Biden announced $100 million in humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank but said if Hamas confiscates the aid ""it will end.""
Biden's visit tried to strike a balance between showing U.S. support for Israel amid its war with Hamas while expressing concern for the civilian casualties. He unequivocally said the U.S. stands with Israel and its right to defend itself from Hamas terror attacks but attempted to dampen growing alarm among Arab allies that the current war could escalate into a wider conflict.
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the approval to allow the aid was given after Biden requested it. He said Israel ""will not thwart"" deliveries of food, water or medicine from Egypt, as long as they don’t go to Hamas militants.

Upon his arrival, Biden met with Netanyahu and said an explosion at Gaza City's al-Ahli Hospital, which left hundreds of civilians dead, was not Israel’s fault — as Hamas and Palestinian supporters claim.
On Wednesday, Israel announced Egypt’s president agreed to open the Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only connection to Egypt, to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. An initial group of 20 trucks delivering aid will start on Friday at the earliest, White House officials said.
Egypt has to first repair the road across the border that was damaged by Israeli airstrikes. More than 200 trucks and some 3,000 tons of aid are positioned at or near the Rafah crossing, according to Khalid Zayed, the head of the Red Crescent for North Sinai.

Previous assistance given to Palestinians in Gaza has been seized by Hamas to construct its voluminous network of tunnels and to purchase weapons, Israeli officials have said.
The new supplies will go in under the supervision of the U.N., Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told Al-Arabiya TV. Asked if foreigners and dual nationals seeking to leave would be let through, he said: ""As long as the crossing is operating normally and the (crossing) facility has been repaired.""

Israel shut off all supplies — including food, water, electricity and fuel — to Gaza soon after Hamas terrorists carried out a ruthless assault on Israeli communities near the border and took at least 200 hostages back into Gaza on Oct. 7.

Reporter slammed for saying accounts of Israeli women rape victims are propaganda,2023-12-05,Fox News,['Gabriel Hays'],"Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., reacts to Rep. Pramila Jayapal's response to a growing concern over atrocities committed by Hamas against women and previews a hearing with FBI Director Chris Wray.
Social media users and X fact-checkers hit back against former Bernie Sanders campaign press secretary and current The Hill TV host Briahna Joy Gray this week after sharing multiple posts denying the validity of accounts of Israeli women raped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7.
X accounts ripped Gray, accusing her of ""dehumanizing"" the Jewish people and stooping low to ""disrespect"" Jewish rape victims.
Gray’s controversial claims also earned her multiple ""Community Notes"" fact-checks, reminding her of the existence of multiple corroborated reports of Hamas terrorists raping Israeli women during October terrorist attack in Israel.

Several of the anchor's controversial statements on the subject came on Monday, when she first posted about a U.S. State Department spokesperson suggesting to the press that Hamas has sexually abused Israeli women in its captivity. 
The spokesperson's statement that Hamas is reluctant to release more women hostages because it would reveal the nature of their abuse at the terror group’s hands prompted reporters at the conference to fire back, saying the U.S. government has provided no evidence that is the case.
On X, Gray commented on the clip, writing, ""Providing no evidence, @StateDeptSpox advances theory that unreleased female Israeli hostages are rape victims who Hamas withheld bc they don't want them to speak publicly about their treatment. What we *know* so far is that Israeli hostages that have been allowed to speak to the press affirmed humane treatment, while Palestinian hostages have attested to beatings & sexual assault.""
Gray’s post received a Community Notes fact-check, linking multiple news outets that have reported ""Significant evidence of Hamas raping women has been provided in the form of video and witness accounts. As is typical, video of the rapes has not been released publicly out of respect for the victims."" 
It added, ""Additionally, released hostages have testified as to their abuse.""
In a follow-up to that post, Gray shared a CNN clip of former State Department member Josh Paul describing what he called ""credible"" claims of a Palestinian boy being raped in an Israeli prison.
Though she had claimed Israel’s rape allegations against Hamas were unverifiable, she pushed the veracity of Israelis raping Palestinians, commenting, ""Israel’s focus on women hostages is interesting since members of the IDF have not limited their sexual violations to females or adults.""
In a subsequent post, The Hill reporter shared a video of Newsweek Opinion Editor Ungar-Sargon blasting Democratic Party lawmakers like Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., for once pushing the notion of ""Believe all women"" when it came to them giving accounts of sexual assault, but being hesitant to believe rape claims from Israeli women in the Israel-Hamas war.
Gray used the point to claim that people should be skeptical about Israeli women claiming to be rape victims of Hamas. She wrote, ""’Believe all women’ was always an absurd overreach: woman should be heard, claims should be investigated, but evidence is required. The same is true of the allegations out of Israel.""
She added, ""But also, this isn’t a ‘believe women’ scenario bc no female victims have offered testimony.""
A Community Notes fact-check came for this post as well, sharing reports of Hamas raping Israeli women from CNN, The Boston Globe, BBC, and an ABC Chicago affiliate. The note stated, ""There are plenty of reports, including witness testimony, showing that Hamas terrorists raped Israeli women.""

Still, the journalist followed that post up with images of news reports describing the rape accounts and accused them of being Zionist propaganda. She posted, ""Zionists are asking that we believe the uncorroborated eyewitness account of *men* who describe alleged rape victims in odd, fetishistic terms. Shame on Israel for not seriously investigating claims of rape and collecting rape kits.""
Fox News Digital reached out to Governor Pritzker’s office for comment. This story will be updated with any response. 
Gray’s posts inspired a deluge of criticism on the platform.
The Dispatch Editor-In-Chief Jonah Goldberg shamed Gray’s previous employers for being associated with someone with her views. He posted, ""Tells you something about the Sanders campaign and The Intercept that this person had significant positions at both.""
Feminist author Jill Filipovic slammed Gray’s point that there are no victims to testify to the rapes, stating, ""Yes it is generally the case that if you kill your victims, they can't testify against you.""
Political commentator Evan Siegfried fact-checked Gray himself, writing, ""1) The female victims you say haven’t offered testimony were either brutally executed or taken hostage by Hamas after experiencing horrific sexual violence 2) Not only are there eyewitness accounts of the rapes, but videos 3) There is significant forensic evidence of these crimes.""
The Israel War Room account also went after the anchor, posting, ""Physical evidence of Hamas's Oct. 7 rapes is overwhelming and includes signs of sexual assault on women's bodies.
In addition to sharing an NBC News post with accounts of Hamas raping women, the account added, ""@Briebriejoy's anti-feminist post begs the question: How can your hatred for Israel be so strong that it turns you into a rape denier?""
Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman excoriated the journalist, declaring, ""You are the worst person I have encountered on X. There aren’t enough words to fully explicate how vile this is.""
Kiryas Joel School District Superintendent Joel Petlin wrote, ""Witnesses to the rapes have testified, but Briahna knows that the victims are all dead. Forensic evidence was collected. Hamas terrorists even brag about it and justify it because it was Jews. How low does @briebriejoy have to stoop to disrespect these Jewish rape victims?""
And political influencer account Fusilli Spock wrote, ""The knots, they have to tie themselves into to continue dehumanizing Jews will never stop amazing me.""

"Viral plastic surgeon says Hollywood celebrities need to learn Israel-Hamas history from books, not memes",2023-11-08,Fox News,['Brian Flood'],"Dr. Sheila Nazarian, the star of Netflix’s ""Skin Decision: Before and After,"" said celebrities who want to speak out on the Israel-Hamas war should educate themselves first.
Jewish Iranian-American plastic surgeon Dr. Sheila Nazarian, the star of Netflix’s ""Skin Decision: Before and After"" who recently went viral for calling out progressive Jews, has a message for Hollywood folks who want to speak out on the Israel-Hamas war. 
""All of these actors and actresses who have never even stepped foot into that region… these huge celebrities who, to this day, are listening to their hairstylists and going to fake plastic surgeons and, you know, taking the advice of people who don't know anything… now they're talking about complex Middle Eastern issues. They know nothing of the history. They know nothing of what's going on, and they feel like it's their right to make a statement,"" Dr. Nazarian told Fox News Digital before offering advice to celebrities. 
""If you haven't been to the region, if you haven't read the history… in a book, not a meme, and not what your hairstylist told you, better to stay quiet,"" she said. ""I grew up there, I feel like I can say something. I lived there; I have family in Israel. I've been to the region many times. I've seen it with my own eyes.""
FLASHBACK: RAPPER MACKLEMORE WAS ACCUSED OF ANTISEMITISM YEARS BEFORE SPEAKING AT ‘FREE PALESTINE’ RALLY
Dr. Sheila Nazarian, the star of Netflix’s ""Skin Decision: Before and After"" said Hollywood folks who want to speak out on the Israel-Hamas war should educate themselves on the topic first.  ((Photo by JC Olivera/Getty Images))
Nazarian was actually born in New York, where her Iranian parents frequently traveled before the 1979 Islamic Revolution made it so her Jewish family no longer felt safe living in Iran. When she was six, her parents fled Iran and eventually landed in Los Angeles, where she lived out the American dream by becoming an award-winning plastic surgeon. She has become a go-to doctor in Hollywood and has appeared on reality TV programs such as ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" and ""Revenge Body with Khloe Kardashian."" 
But first and foremost, Nazarian is still a Jewish person who fled Iran, and she has been appalled by what she’s seen from some Hollywood progressives since Hamas slaughtered over 1,400 civilians, including women, children and the elderly. She has been an outspoken defender of Israel for years and her pinned post on X is from March 2022 and says, ""If you are silent when terrorists murder Israelis, stay silent when Israel defends itself."" 
She feels the message holds up over a year after she posted it, as the Hamas terror attacks on Israel have left many Americans defending Israel’s right to retaliate, while some progressives call for a ceasefire.
""The reason why I decided to start speaking up is my daughter… I said, ‘Oh my goodness, she's four years away from being on a college campus and look at what's happening on college campuses. There's such walking on eggshells,"" she said. 
""What is the purpose of college if you can't go and listen to people who have different thoughts than you, or come from a different walk of life and see the world through a different lens? So, with great trepidation, I put the hashtag Shabbat Shalom on one of my Instagram posts. And in Iran, you never said you were Jewish,"" she continued. ""I just I did it for my kids. Then, when the conflict broke out two years ago, I went straight into survival mode and I just said, ‘You know what? I have a roof over my head… I will be able to sleep well at night knowing that I have done everything I can to make this world a better place for my children.’ And so, I did one post in defense of Israel and I lost 3000 followers in the first 30 minutes and I just kept going.""

Nazarian said it was ""really scary at first"" and was prepared to lose it all, but the opposite happened. She says she's been stopped by people who thank her for being a voice with the courage to speak up. 
""I did lose a lot of followers, but I gained a lot of followers. And my patients when I would walk in the room would be in tears saying, 'I loved you before and I'm obsessed with you now,'"" she said.
Last month, ""Jeopardy"" host Mayim Bialik, who is Jewish and another outspoken supporter of Israel, posted a lengthy video about the rise of antisemitism in America. Bialik said many liberal Jewish people in America were stunned that some progressives marched and cheered in solidarity with the Hamas terror attacks of Oct. 7. 
""I respect her, and I appreciate her voice, but the last minute of it really just, you know, she expressed how the progressive spaces that she's been in have been such a letdown and that she's so devastated, when in my view… the signs were there that these people were never pro-Israel, they're never pro-Jewish,"" Nazarian said. 
BLACK LIVES MATTER GROUP DEFENDS HAMAS TERROR AS 'DESPERATE ACT OF SELF-DEFENSE' THAT 'MUST NOT BE CONDEMNED'
""For example, Black Lives Matter in their charter was antisemitic. And I called them out two years ago in the height of the Black Lives Matter organization. I'm not saying Black lives don't matter, but that organization was antisemitic and corrupt and all of those things,"" she continued. ""I called it out from the beginning and there was some pushback on that. Whereas now people were like, ‘Oh my God, you were right.’""
Nazarian didn’t realize her response to Bialik would go so viral, and she said she filmed it on a whim without makeup because she needed to get her message off her chest. Her response has been viewed over 1.2 million times on her X account alone. 
""I do think a lot of the progressive Jews have come around and are admitting and seeing the hypocrisy. I've had people that were at Shabbat dinner in my own house while I'm feeding them, screaming at me two years ago in disagreement, now calling me and saying, ‘I'm sorry I screamed at you. You were right,'"" she said. ""So, I do think that there is a shift and a realization and an awakening. Will it change how they vote? We shall see.""

Dem senators tell White House any further assistance to Israel ‘must be consistent with our interests’,2023-11-29,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"George Mason law professor Eugene Kontorovich joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Biden's stance as war rages between Israel and Hamas. 
More than a dozen Democratic senators met with a senior White House official this week to discuss the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the impact it has had on Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and what steps the Biden administration would take after the temporary cease-fire expires. 
U.S. Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, and Jack Reed, D-R.I., were joined by over a dozen of their Democratic colleagues for a virtual meeting with White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday. The named lawmakers then released a statement on Wednesday detailing what was discussed. 
According to the statement, the senators condemned the brutal terror attacks by Hamas, expressed support for funds to immediately replenish Israel’s defensive systems, and tasked the White House with detailing its plan to support Israel in a way that advances U.S. interests. 
""We continue to support additional assistance to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks – but we are all in agreement that this assistance must be consistent with our interests and values and used in a manner that adheres to international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and U.S. law,"" the Democrats said.
They added: ""We need to find a better path toward helping Israel achieve legitimate military and security objectives. U.S. assistance has never come in the form of a blank check – regardless of the recipient.""

The statement comes as Israel and Hamas extended a temporary cease-fire for several more days – with another potential extension being negotiated. The temporary truce included the release of Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israel as well as an opportunity to provide humanitarian relief to Palestinians in Gaza. 
In the letter, the Democratic lawmakers specifically condemned Hamas for initiating a terror attack on Oct. 7 that triggered the current conflict.

""Following the brutal terror attacks that Hamas conducted against Israel, America has stood united in our support for Israel’s duty to defend itself and hold Hamas accountable,"" the Democrats said. ""We believe the U.S. should immediately provide Israel with funding to support this effort, including funds to replenish its defensive systems.""
ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND EXPRESSES ‘HOPE’ HAMAS WILL RELEASE MORE AMERICAN HOSTAGES ‘IN THE DAYS TO COME’
""But to better understand the efficacy of U.S. funding that supports Israel’s operations inside Gaza, we requested answers from the President on how these funds are being used in order to ensure they support an Israeli strategy that will effectively degrade and defeat the threat from Hamas while taking all possible measures to protect civilians in Gaza,"" they added, referencing a letter they sent to President Biden that expressed similar sentiments.

""In our letter to President Biden, we raised several key issues, including maintaining a focus on returning hostages, reducing civilian casualties, delivering humanitarian aid, establishing a plan for post-war governance and the future of the region, and addressing extremist violence in the West Bank. During yesterday’s briefing, we had an opportunity to discuss with the Administration each of the questions raised in our letter,"" they said in Wednesday’s statement.
""As we expressed in the meeting, we are grateful for their leadership in negotiating a temporary ceasefire to secure the release of many hostages and to allow some desperately needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza,"" they said. ""But as the end of the temporary ceasefire looms ahead, we must do more to ensure the protection of innocent civilians.""

The Democrats also said they were ""gravely concerned"" about a resumption in fighting between Israeli Defense Forces and Hamas, which they said ""threatens to once again renew the high rate of civilian casualties and further deepen the humanitarian crisis.""
They also urged President Biden, who has received criticism for his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, to publicly address his strategy, saying ""the Administration must provide transparent responses to the American people on these matters.""
The current truce is scheduled to expire on Nov. 30.

"Hamas attacks reminder that sleeper cells are crossing southern border, expert warns: ‘They’re already here’",2023-10-11,Fox News,['Andrew Mark Miller'],"Retired Gen. Jack Keane joins ‘One Nation with Brian Kilmeade’ to discuss the broader strategic implications of Hamas' terror attack on Israel.
Over 1,000 Israelis were killed by Hamas terrorists who stormed across the country's southern border over the weekend. And one immigration expert told Fox News Digital it's a reminder the U.S. southern border is vulnerable to terrorist crossings. 
""Absolutely,"" Lora Ries, director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital this week when asked if the Hamas attack on Israel serves as a warning that the southern border with Mexico is not secure and is vulnerable to national security threats.
""Particularly the 1.7 million known ‘gotaways,' those who evaded the Border Patrol because they didn't want to be fingerprinted because they're either known or suspected terrorists themselves, convicted aggravated felons, smuggling drugs or some combination thereof. 
""So, when you combine 1.7 million with the 7.4 million CBP has encountered, we have to assume that the sleeper cells of terrorists are here inside the U.S., and Congress needs to wake up and preempt.""

Ries, who has over 26 years experience in the immigration and homeland security field and served as DHS acting deputy chief of staff, told Fox News Digital she is concerned about sleeper cells in the U.S. ""waking up.""
""And already with the Hamas, pro-Hamas protests in the U.S. this week in New York City and elsewhere. That was a very public signal to say, 'Yes, we're here.' And if the U.S. acts to support Israel in the Middle East then there will be a response here,"" Ries said. 
""They don't need to fly in on their Mad Max devices like they did this past weekend in Israel,"" Ries added. ""They're already here.""

For over two years, Border Patrol agents have warned that they have extreme concerns about who is crossing the southern border, primarily because so many agents have been pulled off the front lines to instead focus on processing, leaving gaps where there is no control over the border, Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin reported Tuesday.
Meanwhile, fiscal year 2023 broke the record for encounters on the FBI terror watchlist, with 151 people encountered at the southern border between ports of entry, a higher number than the previous six years combined.

""Americans have no confidence in this administration, and we do not and should not get to the point where a terrorist attack is committed here. And then members of Congress look at each other and ask, ‘How did this happen? How did we get here?’"" Ries said.

December 6 | Israel presses Hamas fighters in Khan Younis as Netanyahu warns of Gaza security control | Live Updates from Fox News Digital,2023-12-06,Fox News,[],"incoming update…


Billionaire and Harvard graduate Bill Ackman is demanding that the presidents of three prestigious universities ""resign in disgrace"" after they refused to say that calling for the genocide of Jews on their respective campuses breached their rules and amounted to harassment.
In a furious post on X, Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, blasted the presidents for failing to call out antisemitic protests that have taken place on their campuses since the Hamas Oct. 7 terrorist attacks and the subsequent onset of the Israel-Hamas war.

The presidents – Dr. Claudine Gay of Harvard, Liz Magill of UPenn, and Dr. Sally Kornbluth of MIT – were grilled Tuesday by Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., during a House committee hearing on the rise of antisemitism on college campuses with Ackman writing that their answers reflect the ""profound educational, moral and ethical failures that pervade certain of our elite educational institutions due in large part to their failed leadership.""
Stefanik, the House GOP chair, asked the presidents if they considered calls for a ""global intifada"" against Jews on campuses as tantamount to a call for violent armed resistance against the state of Israel and the genocide of Jews. She asked whether such rhetoric violated the code of conduct or rules regarding bullying or harassment at those institutions.

Israeli forces encircle the house of Hamas leader, Netanyahu says it is 'only a matter of time'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israeli forces have encircled the home of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Wednesday.
Netanyahu clarified that the IDF does not expect to find Sinwar in the complex, but said it is ""only a matter of time"" before the terrorist leader is found.

""Two short updates: Last night I said that our forces can reach anywhere in the Gaza Strip. Now they are encircling Sinwar's house. So his house is not his fortress, and he can escape, but it's only a matter of time before we get him,"" Netanyahu said.
""Secondly, we exert pressure to allow the Red Cross visits of our hostages. Further to that, today I spoke again with the president of the Red Cross and told her to turn to Qatar, which has been proven to have leverage on Hamas, and demand Red Cross visits to our hostages, and of course the supply of medicine for them,"" he added.


The presidents of Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and The University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) shocked and angered social media users with testimony given during a congressional hearing on antisemitism.
The school leaders arrived at Capitol Hill on Tuesday to answer questions about rising antisemitism on their campuses before the House Education and Workforce Committee.
During the hearing, MIT President Sally Kornbluth was asked whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates the private land-grant research university's codes of conduct regarding bullying and harassment.
""If targeting individuals, not making public statements,"" Kornbluth replied.

Barstool Sports owner and founder David Portnoy released a lengthy statement on the testimony to his website, admitting he ""couldn't keep his mouth shut"" after watching the video from Congress. He said the responses from the school left him ""speechless"" and ""irate.""

Ivy League presidents testified before Congress Tuesday over antisemitism on their campuses, prompting outrage from some Jewish students who fear for their own safety on campus.
Harvard graduate student Shabbos Kestenbaum called out President Claudine Gay during ""FOX & Friends First"" on Wednesday after Gay declined to answer ""yes"" when asked whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates the university's code of conduct.
""This was a softball question of ‘do you condemn the rising rhetoric and violence against Jewish students?’ And none of them would condemn it,"" Kestenbaum told Todd Piro Wednesday. ""If Claudine Gay had a heart, she would resign, and if the Harvard Board of Trustees had a brain, they would fire her."" 
""She's an absolute disgrace to this university,"" he continued. ""She has let down Jewish students repeatedly, and Harvard is simply not a safe place for Jewish students anymore. There is a moral rot at the center of all of these Ivy League universities.""

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., questioned Ivy League presidents on the surge of antisemitism on college campuses during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday. She pressed them on whether the concerning trend violates the rules of the universities, but each of them insisted it would depend on the ""context.""

White House interns demand Biden seek Israel-Hamas cease-fire in anonymous letter

Interns at the White House are urging that President Biden push for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, according to a letter shared with NBC News. 
""The letter, first shared with NBC News and addressed to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, is supported by more than 40 interns who work in the White House and other executive branch offices, according to the text,"" the outlet reported.

Putin makes rare trip outside Russia for OPEC talks with Saudi Arabia as Israeli war rages

Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in the Middle East, where he is meeting with the leaders of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia to shore up support from the major oil producers.

Putin, who has not visited the region since July 2022, is meeting for talks with President Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi. Despite relying on America for its security, ties between Russia and the UAE have tightened with the onset of the war as Russian investors have poured money into UAE real estate.
Putin is then due to travel to Saudi Arabia for his first face-to-face meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since October 2019 to discuss oil production, OPEC+ and the war in the Gaza Strip, and the war with Ukraine.
The trip comes as Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the war in Ukraine. The ICC has charged him with the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia, but neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE has signed the ICC founding treaty, meaning they do not face any obligation to detain Putin.

 to keep building on recent progress in bilateral ties and work together to keep the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza from spreading.
Both Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken referred in a telephone call to last month's closely watched meeting between the two countries' leaders in San Francisco following years of frigid ties.
""The important task for both sides at present is to continue the positive impact of the San Francisco meeting, implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state, and consolidate the momentum of stabilizing Sino-U.S. relations,"" Wang said, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Blinken also emphasized that the two sides should build on progress at the summit, according to the U.S. State Department.

A panel of voters joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss their take on Trump's town hall with Sean Hannity in Iowa on Wednesday.
Voters said that with the war in Israel, combatting anti-semitism is likely to be a major issue in the 2024 presidential election as well as elections across the country. While support for Israel
 remains overwhelmingly bipartisan, the Democratic Party has a minority of radical progressives who have viciously criticized Israel, calling it an apartheid state and accusing the Israeli government of committing genocide.

Israel says it has killed half of Hamas' commanders, but 2 prime targets remain alive

The Israeli military says it has killed roughly half of Hamas' mid-level battalion commanders, greatly hampering the terrorist organization's ability to act cohesively in Gaza, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Israel said
 earlier this week that it has killed some 5,000 Hamas troops, but the terrorist groups' leaders remain alive. Those top targets are Yahya Sinwar, the terrorist' group's leader in Gaza, and Mohammed Deif, who leads the organization's militants. Israel says both leaders may be hiding in tunnels beneath the city of Khan Younis, WSJ reported.
Khan Younis is the second most populated city in Gaza, and it remains Hamas' final stronghold in the region as Israel continues to press its advance. Israel says 88 of its troops have been killed in the fighting since the ground invasion began.

Bus company leaves pro-Israel supporters stranded before rally: 'it’s obvious what happened here'


A few hundred Jewish people on their way from Toronto to Ottawa for a pro-Israel protest were abandoned when over a dozen drivers did not show up, with protest organizers accusing the company responsible for driving the buses of antisemitism. 
""We were shocked that, of more than 70 buses UJA booked, 17 did not show up,"" United Jewish Appeal (UJA) president and CEO Adam Minsky said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Those 17 buses were the responsibility of a particular subcontracted company.""
""Despite charging in full in advance and confirming its participation, the company did not send a single bus and has declined all communications while refusing to provide any explanation,"" Minsky explained. 

""Given the absolute silence of the subcontractor and with no other explanation, we are driven to the view that this shameful decision is intended to disrupt our peaceful rally out of hatred toward Jews,"" he added, calling the act ""sickening and outrageous"" and promising to take legal action. 
""Hate and discrimination against any community can never be tolerated in Canada,"" Minsky declared.

Biden urges world to condemn Hamas sexual violence, blames terror group for collapse of cease-fire

President Biden said Tuesday that Hamas had repeatedly raped women and mutilated their bodies during the Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel, citing accounts from survivors and witnesses to the attacks.
While at a political fundraiser in Boston, the president called on the world to condemn the ""unimaginable cruelty"" of Hamas' sexual violence ""without exception.""
""Reports of women raped — repeatedly raped — and their bodies being mutilated while still alive, of women's corpses being desecrated, Hamas terrorists inflicting as much pain and suffering on women and girls as possible and then murdering them. It is appalling,"" Biden said, according to Reuters.
Israeli police are investigating possible sexual crimes by some of the few hundred Hamas members that they arrested after the Oct. 7 attack. Israel's justice ministry said ""victims were tortured, physically abused, raped, burned alive and dismembered.""
In a statement on its Telegram channel, Hamas said it denounced Biden's ""attempt to falsely accuse"" its fighters of committing sexual violence and rape on Oct. 7.
The Palestinian terror group accused Biden and Israel of covering up war crimes in Gaza and spreading misinformation to sway public opinion.

Holocaust victims' family torches women's groups' silence on Hamas atrocities: 'Horrendous'

A Jewish-American columnist who is the descendant of Holocaust victims lambasted top women's groups for their silence against documented evidence of widespread rapes, dismemberment and torture of Israeli women by Palestinian Hamas terrorists.
Daniella Greenbaum Davis told FOX News she is outraged at the silence or countervailing comments from women's rights activists and those who proclaim to be part of the #MeToo movement or other liberal causes.
In one case cited by ""The Story"" anchor Martha MacCallum, a volunteer member of Israel's October 7 Response Team appeared shellshocked at a podium as he recounted some of the horrors he and his team viewed as they recovered bodies of those murdered by Hamas.
""Her body was brutal (sic) in a way that we cannot identify her from her head to toes. She was abused in a way that we could not understand and cannot deal with,"" said Simcha Greinman in public remarks.

MacCallum reported to Davis that the World Health Organization, Planned Parenthood, the Women's March group, and EMILY's List have all said little or nothing about the abuse and murder of women by Hamas.

Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari issued a ""call for action"" to the international community Wednesday, saying that the International Red Cross must be allowed to visit the 138 hostages who remain in Hamas custody.
Hamas has so far refused to allow the Red Cross to visit the hostages, a contributing factor to the collapse of a cease-fire late last week.
""This is an urgent call for action. The international community must take action. The Red Cross must have access to the hostages that are in the hands of Hamas,"" Hagari said.
While Israel says
 there are still some 138 hostages in Hamas custody, the U.S. has warned that there is no way to know how many of those are still alive. Many hostages who have already been released have told stories of horrific treatment by their Hamas captors.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Tuesday that the Israeli military will maintain security control over Gaza long after the war against Hamas ends.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Tuesday that the Israeli military will maintain security control over Gaza long after the war against Hamas ends.
Netanyahu made the comments during a Tuesday press conference, potentially angering President Biden's administration. Biden has repeatedly stated that an Israeli occupation of Gaza would be a ""mistake.""

“No international force can be responsible for this,” Netanyahu told reporters. “I’m not ready to close my eyes and accept any other arrangement.”
Israel is quickly grinding down Hamas militarily, but the fate of the roughly 137 hostages still in Gaza remains uncertain.

The Israeli Air Force struck approximately 250 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip in the past day, the Israel Defense Forces said.

In addition to the IAF strikes, the IDF said troops on the ground are still locating weapons, tunnels, explosives and additional military infrastructure in Gaza. Troops are also directing fighter jets to strike terror targets once found.

Israeli hostages detail physical, sexual abuse at hands of Hamas terrorists

A group of Israeli hostages told government officials about the physical and sexual abuse they endured in captivity in Gaza.
According to Haaretz, the hostages told Netanyahu's cabinet about being beaten and degraded by their Hamas captors.
""They touch girls, and everyone knows it,"" a female hostage said. ""I won't recount details, but we had a procedure that no one moves without someone guarding them.""
""Medications ran out, and they gave us the wrong drugs,"" she added.
Another ex-hostage told Israeli officials that male captives lived in worse conditions than female hostages.

What is Hamas? An overview of the Islamic group that attacked Israel,2023-10-08,Fox News,['Gabriele Regalbuto'],"Former Israeli diplomat Shahar Azani joins 'FOX Report' to discuss the potential responses by Israel to the attacks from Hamas.
Hamas is a group of Iranian-backed terrorists. The group is designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the State Department. According to the U.S., EU and Israel, it has maintained an iron-clad grip on Gaza since violently taking over the territory in 2007, after Israel unilaterally withdrew in 2005.
On Dec. 14, 2022, Yahya Sinwar, leader of the Hamas terror group, and others celebrated the 35th anniversary of Hamas' founding at the Gaza Strip.
The militant Islamist group, which receives funding and training from Iran, imposes a strict Islamic code on its two million plus residents and continues to engage in fighting Israel, including firing endless rounds of rockets and incendiary devices into Israeli territory, as well as mass protests along the border fence.

Hamas terrorists released videos of their militants kidnapping women, children and the elderly and desecrating dead bodies on their social media. Seth Frantzman, a correspondent for The Jerusalem Post and an analyst on Middle East affairs, told Fox News Digital in an interview on Sunday that the videos are shocking but that Hamas ""has engaged in 30 years of grotesque terrorism and is a vicious brutal terrorist organization.""

"Egypt warned Israel of attack, House Foreign Affairs chairman claims",2023-10-12,Fox News,['Charles Creitz'],"Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, joins 'Your World' to discuss developments in Israel, Gaza. 
House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, claimed Wednesday that Egyptian officials warned Israel of a potential attack from Hamas prior to the deadly incursion in which the Palestinian terror group murdered hundreds of civilians.
In a public address Monday, however, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly denied any such claim.
McCaul reacted on ""Your World"" to National Security Council spokesman John Kirby being asked about such allegations during a White House press briefing.
Kirby had said he could not speak to ""specific intelligence matters"" and that the White House's focus is cooperating with Israel and making sure Netanyahu's administration gets the ""tools they need.""

McCaul said he would not get too specific.
""We do know the Egyptian intelligence did refer this to Israel. And I can't get into any more depth than that. But I do think there was a threat-stream out there. It was a failure of intelligence,"" he said on ""Your World.""
The Texas lawmaker said he moderated a classified briefing on the invasion with the entire U.S. House, adding Hamas reportedly planned their attack for more than a year.
""When the Egyptians did warn Israeli officials, obviously, there wasn't enough done to stop it. This concerns me not just with respect to Hamas, but what about our intelligence on Hezbollah? What about our intelligence on Iran? They say there's no clear link to Iran. I disagree with that.""
He went on to call claims from U.S. officials that Iran didn't have obvious complicity with the attack ""absolutely laughable.""
BIDEN ‘COMPLICIT WITH THE ATTACKS’, TIM SCOTT SAYS, GIVEN BEHAVIOR TOWARD IRAN
For his part Netanyahu said Monday that no warning came from Cairo, and called the story ""fake news"" during a public address.
""No early message came from Egypt and the prime minister did not speak or meet with the intelligence chief since the establishment of the government,"" Netanyahu's office said in a statement according to the Jerusalem Post.
""The report to the effect that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received a message in advance from Egypt is absolutely false,"" the PM's office tweeted, according to the New York Post.

McCaul said it is not entirely clear what the U.S. intelligence community knew or didn't know about the attack either.
He went on to note the bloody invasion occurred around the 50th Anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, and that of the assassination of Egyptian Prime Minister Anwar Sadat – who is remembered for forging a landmark peace agreement with then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
The treaty, known as the Camp David Accords, were signed in 1978 under the mediation of then-President Jimmy Carter at the presidential retreat in Maryland.

Brandeis University bans Students for Justice in Palestine for its support of Hamas,2023-11-07,Fox News,['Lindsay Kornick'],"Columbia student David Pomerantz and NYU student Allison Lax on what they are seeing at their campuses as students rally against Israel.
Brandeis University said Monday it will no longer recognize Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) on its campus.
The Brandeis SJP announced through its Instagram account that its ""Vigil for Palestine"" event planned for Monday was canceled after the group was ""unjustly de-charted.""
""With heavy hearts, we would like to announce that our chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine has been unjustly de-charted. This comes as a part of Brandeis University, an institution that values social justice, trying to silence us from speaking our truth. We thank everyone who stood by us during this beautiful journey, and we encourage you to reach out to us if you need any kind of support. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. Until liberation, Students for Justice in Palestine,"" the post read.
According to the Jewish Insider, Brandeis SJP was sent a letter that said, in a ""decision [that] was not made lightly,"" the group would be derecognized and no longer receive funding or be permitted to conduct campus events or use the Brandeis name.

""The National SJP has called on its chapters to engage in conduct that supports Hamas in its call for the violent elimination of Israel and the Jewish people. These tactics are not protected by the University’s Principles. As a result, the University made the decision that the Brandeis chapter of the National SJP must be unrecognized and will no longer be eligible to receive funding, be permitted to conduct activities on campus, or use the Brandeis name and logo in promoting itself or its activities, including through social media channels,"" the letter reportedly read. 
""Students who choose to engage in conduct in support of Hamas, or engage in conduct that harasses or threatens violence, whether individually or through organized activity, will be considered to be in violation of the University’s student code of conduct,"" the letter continued, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Brandeis spokeswoman Julie Jette confirmed, ""National SJP has called on its chapters to engage in conduct that supports Hamas in its call for the elimination of the only Jewish state in the world and its people. Such expression is not protected by Brandeis' principles of free speech. Students are welcome to express their support for Palestinians in a manner that complies with our rights and responsibilities. The removal of recognition had nothing to do with a vigil.""
Jette further pointed to Brandeis University President Ronald Liebowitz's Monday op-ed in the Boston Globe, entitled ""How universities should confront antisemitism on campus,"" to explain ""his position on speech used to threaten or harass.""
In his piece, Liebowitz remarked that student organizations ""should lose all privileges"" if they took part in protests calling for violence or the ""annihilation"" of the Jewish State and detailed how his university would handle it.

""Most urgently, in this twilight zone moment when students and faculty seem to be enjoying their freedom to express grotesque language about Jews, Jewish life, and the Jewish state, Brandeis will uphold free speech rightly understood. Universities cannot stop hate speech, but they can stop paying for it. Brandeis will ensure that groups that receive privileges through their affiliations with the university, including using its name, will lose their affiliations and privileges when they spew hate,"" Liebowitz wrote.
He added, ""Contrary to the prevalence of the BDS movement on college campuses, Brandeis will pursue closer ties with Israeli academic and cultural institutions and will encourage more universities to follow suit.""

Brandeis Hillel executive director Rabbi Seth Winberg had previously addressed the Jewish student group about Monday's ""Vigil for Palestine,"" offering support and discouraging engagement with SJP. 
In a statement to Fox News Digital, Winberg praised the school's decision, saying, ""Brandeis University’s decision today shows unequivocally that supporting terrorism and creating a hostile campus environment has consequences, and acknowledges the reality that Jewish students are confronting more antisemitism on campuses. Campuses should be safe places for all students alike - Jewish and Muslim, Israeli, and Palestinian - to live, learn, and thrive.""

Gaza hospital doctor says nearly 10 babies at risk of dying soon over fuel shortages,2023-10-24,Fox News,['Greg Norman'],"Yasmine Mohammed, president of Free Hearts Free Minds, explains that many civilians in Gaza remain silent out of fear for their lives and criticizes 'pro-Hamas rallies' around the world. 
A doctor at a hospital in the Gaza Strip warned Monday that nearly 10 babies in their neonatal unit will soon be dead if the facility runs out of fuel in about two days due to shortages. 
Dr. Hatem Edhair made the claim to The Associated Press as Hamas continues to refuse an offer by Israel to end its widespread blockade of fuel and other humanitarian supplies from entering Gaza if the Palestinian terrorist group releases the more than 200 hostages it is believed to have taken. 
Edhair said there are eight babies in the intensive care unit and 10 others in the neonatal department at Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis, which is expected to run out of fuel within 48 hours. 
""Half of these children are on CPAP (pressurized air) machines and oxygen machines,"" he said Monday. ""If the hospital runs out of fuel, half of these babies will die in less than 24 hours.""

A professor at the University of Virginia appears to be offering extra credit to students who attend a discussion about how to ""stand in solidarity with Palestinians resisting occupation"" Thursday night.
According to a screenshot obtained by Fox News Digital, Tessa Farmer, an associate professor of global studies and anthropology at UVA, sent a message to students on Oct. 12 to promote an event hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine, advertised as a ""[teach-in] and demonstration about the current situation in Gaza, the events and history that led to this moment, and a discussion about how we can [stand] in solidarity with Palestinians resisting occupation.""

""By posting the information provided by the organizers about the event that is happening today, I did not intend to imply that there is a link between endorsing the viewpoint of the organization and receiving extra credit for the course. In attending any event, I encourage you to critically engage with the content presented and to form your own opinion,"" she wrote.
""In the reflection on any event, the request is that you critically engage with the content of the event using the tools that the class offers,"" she added.
Many student groups at higher education institutions across the country have come under sharp criticism after the deadly attack carried out by Hamas terrorists in Israel on Oct. 7 – the deadliest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust.
UVA’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter said the attack against Israel represents a ""step towards a free Palestine.""
The chapter also said it mourns the loss of human life taken in the war and hopes for ""long-lasting peace"" that it says cannot be achieved without the establishment of equity and justice.
On Thursday, Miyares sent a letter to all Virginia university and college presidents with ""deep concern for the rhetoric of some student groups that are sympathetic to Saturday’s terrorist attacks in Israel.""
""Groups like ‘Students for Justice in Palestine’ have publicly stated that they plan ‘Day of Resistance""demonstrations this week. This pro-Hamas group is using language that suggests advocacy or threats of violence, such as calling for physical confrontations or ‘dismantling’ Zionism on campus,'"" the letter states.

""The right to freedom of speech does not include violent acts against persons or property. Individuals who commit crimes as part of demonstrations are subject to arrest and prosecution. Similarly, students remain, of course, subject to student codes of conduct,"" the AG said.
Miyares said his office has been contacted by students, parents and other student groups that ""are rightfully concerned about these planned demonstrations.""
Miyares urged the school administrations to ""provide additional security to promote the safety of all students,"" adding that ""enhanced security may also be necessary after the demonstrations to promote a safe campus environment.""

In addition, Miyares encouraged the schools to ""provide counseling resources to affected students and to make arrangements to assist students who have had family members impacted by the violence.""
""Lastly, if you have not already done so, please develop a clear safety plan for students, staff, and faculty to promote public safety and ensure viewpoint diversity. Your Office of Attorney General University Counsel stands ready to assist in any of these efforts,"" Miyares said.

"Ilhan Omar condemns Israel’s military response to Hamas, says ‘solution’ is ‘negotiated peace’",2023-10-10,Fox News,['Anders Hagstrom'],"National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby joined ""America's Newsroom"" to discuss the latest on the war in Israel as violence with Hamas escalates.
Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., attacked Israel's response to an unprecedented assault by Hamas in an extensive thread on social media Monday.
Omar, a longtime critic of Israel and advocate for Palestinians, seemed to equate the Israeli victims killed by Hamas terrorists this weekend and Palestinians killed in the ongoing Israeli response.
""Just as we honor the humanity of the hundreds of innocent Israeli civilians and 9 Americans who were killed this weekend, we must honor the humanity of the innocent Palestinian civilians who have been killed and whose lives are upended,"" she wrote.
Omar went on to highlight the hardships of living in Gaza, accusing Israel of operating an ""apartheid"" state in an attempt to explain violence by Hamas.
""Palestinian residents of the West Bank have scarcely better lives than Gazans — with the routine destruction of their ancestral homes, destruction of their crops, and violent attacks by Israeli settlers,"" Omar wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

""Palestinians have few recourses for justice and accountability. Attacks by the IDF and settlers against Palestinians are regularly met with impunity. Efforts to seek justice in international courts are stonewalled by the Israeli government, with U.S. support,"" she added. ""As the world is condemning Hamas’s attacks, we must also oppose an Israeli military response that has already taken the lives of hundreds of Palestinians, including nearly two dozen children.""
Omar's office did not respond to questions from Fox News Digital asking her to elaborate on the thread.
The congresswoman did not clarify how she believed Israel should have responded to Saturday's attack, which has since left at least 1,000 Israelis dead and 2,700 more wounded. The Minnesota Democrat's only suggestion for a ""solution to this horror"" was ""a negotiated peace — with Israelis and Palestinians enjoying equal rights and security guarantees.""
Rep. Ilhan Omar went on to say that the world should ""oppose"" Israel's ongoing military response against Hamas, saying it has cost the lives of hundreds of Palestinians.

Later in the thread, Omar said that Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had called all Palestinians ""human animals"" in comments earlier this week, though his full statement made clear that he was referring only to Hamas terrorists.
FAMILIES OF ISRAELIS FEARED KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS TERRORISTS SPEAK OUT 
""We are imposing a complete siege on Gaza. There will be no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything will be closed,"" Gallant said. ""We are fighting human animals and we act accordingly.""

ILHAN OMAR'S LONG HISTORY OF CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS
Israeli forces have deployed tens of thousands of troops to the area around Gaza City, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested a ground invasion may be imminent.
Other statements from Omar have sparked controversy in the past.
When she took office in 2019, she soon had to answer for a now-deleted 2012 tweet in which she wrote, ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."" She later expressed regret, saying the ""unfortunate words were the only words"" she could ""think about expressing at that moment"" in reference to Israel's 2012 operation against Hamas in Gaza.
Also in 2019, speaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) fundraiser, Omar said: ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."" Critics accused her of trying to downplay the actions of terrorists by describing it as ""some people did something."" She later clarified, ""Many Americans found themselves now having their civil rights stripped from them, and so what I was speaking to was the fact that as a Muslim, not only was I suffering as an American who was attacked on that day, but the next day I woke up as my fellow Americans were now treating me as a suspect.""

Also, in January 2023, Omar responded to the outrage over a 2019 tweet in which she described America's relationship with Israel as ""all about the Benjamins,"" a tweet for which she later apologized.
""I certainly did not or was not aware that the word ‘hypnotized’ was a trope. I wasn’t aware of the fact that there are tropes about Jews and money. That has been very enlightening part of this journey,"" she told CNN.

Republican AGs put media ‘on notice’ for potentially supporting terrorism,2023-12-04,Fox News,['Emma Colton'],"FOX News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports from Sderot, Israel as the fight between Hamas and Israel resumes.
FIRST ON FOX: More than a dozen state attorneys general signed a letter to media outlets such as the New York Times and Reuters, putting them ""on notice"" that providing material support to terrorist organizations such as Hamas is illegal, Fox News Digital exclusively learned. 
""We will continue to follow your reporting to ensure that your organizations do not violate any federal or State laws by giving material support to terrorists abroad. Now your organizations are on notice. Follow the law,"" 14 state attorneys general stated in a letter to the chiefs of CNN, The New York Times, Reuters and The Associated Press on Monday afternoon. 
Republican Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird spearheaded the letter, which detailed concerns that journalists embedded with Hamas may actually have deep connections with the terrorist organization ""and may have participated in the October 7 attack."" 
""Reporting credibly alleges that some of the individuals that your outlets hire have deep and troubling ties to Hamas—and may have participated in the October 7 attack. In the wake of those alarming reports, some of you have cut ties with these so-called journalists whose connections to terror groups have become too obvious to hide. Good. But one factor in determining whether an organization has provided material support for terrorism is that it be ‘knowing,’"" the letter states. 
LAWMAKERS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM AP, REUTERS AMID ACCUSATIONS THEIR JOURNALISTS KNEW ABOUT HAMAS ATTACK

The attorneys general said the four outlets have a responsibility to fully vet potential hires and ensure they have no connections to terrorist organizations before putting them on the payroll and embedding them during armed conflicts. 
""If your outlet’s current hiring practices led you to give material support to terrorists, you must change these policies going forward. Otherwise, we must assume any future support of terrorist organizations by your stringers, correspondents, contractors, and similar employees is knowing behavior,"" they wrote. 
The state AGs pointed to a recent letter sent by a bipartisan group of lawmakers to Reuters asking ""how its journalist knew to be available for the October 7 attack,"" and called on the outlet to address whether it had prior knowledge of the attack or if one of the organization’s journalists had been in contact with Hamas before the attack. 
PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS WILL NOT ANSWER WHETHER HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION
Israel was catapulted into chaos on Oct. 7 when Hamas terrorists launched surprise attacks on the nation that quickly escalated to war between Israel and Palestine. At least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers have since been killed, another estimated 5,000 Israelis injured and 13,300 Palestinians and Hamas terrorists killed.

The letter went on to argue that the issue of providing material support to terrorist organizations is not new, pointing to a watchdog group telling the AP five years ago that ""one of its journalists worked for the Hamas-affiliated Quds TV."" While The New York Times, the AGs continued, published an op-ed in 2020 penned by Taliban deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. 
""Mr. Haqqani himself is on the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control Sanctions List. Did the Times pay for that piece? If so, whom did it pay? Was that payment consistent with federal and State laws? These questions are still unanswered,"" the letter stated. 
AUTHOR ACCUSES NEW YORK TIMES OF ‘BIAS AGAINST ISRAEL’ IN COVERAGE OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK: ‘BEYOND THE PALE’
The letter details that material support statutes recognize that terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, ""are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that [criminal] conduct."" 
The federal government ""defines material support to include ‘any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments . . . expert advice or assistance . . . communications equipment, facilities . . . and transportation, except medicine or religious materials,’"" the AGs continued. 
The New York Times drew criticism for its coverage of a hospital blast in Gaza. (Getty Images)
The letter notes that material support statutes ""have survived First Amendment scrutiny"" and that a law ""distinguishes material support for terrorism from protected speech.""
""The First Amendment and core free-speech principles protect the right to hold even disgusting views. For example, this letter does not call for any action regarding the New York Times’s decision to hire a reporter to cover the ongoing war in Israel–despite that reporter’s praise for Adolf Hitler and the ‘state of harmony’ Hitler achieved while perpetrating the Holocaust"" the AGs wrote.

""I write regarding reports that so-called 'journalists' employed by the Associated Press, CNN, New York Times, and Reuters accompanied Hamas terrorists into Israel during the October 7 terror attack. These individuals almost certainly knew about the attack in advance, and even participated by accompanying Hamas terrorists during the attack and filming the heinous acts. In at least one case, one of the individuals affiliated with these media outlets even took a selfie while being kissed on the cheek by a Hamas leader who helped mastermind the attack,"" Cotton wrote in his letter.

The AGs’ letter cited Cotton and argued The New York Times ""avoided giving Senator Tom Cotton a meaningful response to his legitimate concerns that the newspaper had provided material support for terrorists.""
ISRAEL LAUNCHES 10,000TH AIRSTRIKE AGAINST HAMAS, AS PALESTINIANS SEEK SHELTER IN CROWDED SOUTHERN GAZA
""It instead stated that ""[n]o employee"" was embedded with Hamas or had advance knowledge of the October 7 attacks. Notably absent from that defense are non-employees—freelancers, stringers, or other payees. Even more conspicuous is the absence of an acknowledgment that Times-paid photographers accompanied Hamas terrorists during the attacks,"" the AGs wrote. 
Reuters, AP, CNN and The New York Times have all previously issued statements denying any prior knowledge of the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. CNN and the AP previously reported they cut ties with a freelance photographer who was reportedly with Hamas terrorists when the war was launched. 
Reuters told Fox News Digital later Monday that it ""categorically denies that it had prior knowledge of the attack or that we embedded journalists with or otherwise accompanied Hamas on October 7.""
""Reuters acquired photographs from two Gaza-based freelance photographers who were at the border on the morning of October 7. We had no prior relationship with either journalist. The photographs published by Reuters were taken two hours after Hamas fired rockets across southern Israel and more than 45 minutes after Israel said gunmen had crossed the border. Reuters staff journalists were not on the ground at the locations referred to in the claims published on social media,"" a spokesperson for the outlet continued. 
The spokesperson added that no evidence of alleged ""coordination with Hamas by the two freelance journalists whose images we published.""
""To reiterate, Reuters had no employees embedded with or otherwise accompanying Hamas during the October 7 attack or since. Reuters at no time has provided funding to Hamas or its affiliates.""
The AGs' letter continued that Reuters and the AP hired an individual accused of ""posting a video showing that he was carrying a grenade on a motorcycle during the conflict"" and that The New York Times had suggested there were ""red flags"" concerning the journalist, including posing for a photo showing a Hamas leader kissing the individual on the cheek.

""That type of close relationship with a well-known terrorist mastermind should raise concerns for organizations worried about providing material support for terrorists—all the more because that journalist was identified to AP in 2018 for his relationship with Hamas,"" they said. 
The letter was signed by Republican attorneys general in Iowa, Alabama, Florida, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Texas, Louisiana, Utah, Montana, Virginia, South Carolina, West Virginia and Tennessee.

""We reiterate: material support of terrorist organizations is illegal. You should ensure that you are taking all necessary steps to prevent your organizations from contracting with members of terror organizations. We urge you in the strongest terms to take care that your hiring practices conform to the laws forbidding material support for terror organizations,"" the letter continued.

Israel’s military announced Tuesday that another 300 Hamas targets have been attacked in the Gaza Strip over the last day as troops on the ground ""conducted several battles with terrorist squads that fired anti-tank missiles or machine guns at the forces."" 
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the ongoing military activity in northern Gaza focuses on ""the center of gravity of Hamas."" 
""We are hunting their commanders. We are attacking their infrastructure and whenever there is any potent target that is related to Hamas, we strike it,"" he said. ""Now we do so with professionalism. Hamas is the enemy, not the civilian population."" 
The Israeli air force said in a post Tuesday that the IDF has ""attacked about 300 targets during the last day, among them the shafts of anti-tank and rocket launching positions, tunnel shafts and military compounds of the terrorist organization Hamas.""

""Fighter jets of the Air Force attacked a short time ago the infrastructures of the terrorist organization Hezbollah in the territory of Lebanon,"" it also said, noting that ""weapons, positions and sites used by the organization were destroyed.""

""But at the end of the day, what is important here is for the state of Lebanon to understand that they stand to lose almost everything and gain absolutely nothing by allowing Hezbollah to drag them into a war,"" he added. ""And if anybody cares about the state of Lebanon, they should be out of this war because they will gain nothing from helping a bunch of terrorists in Gaza.""  
""We continue to be deployed, strong and vigilant along our borders,"" Conricus concluded.

"Jon Lovitz goes after Bernie Sanders, Dem Squad over opposition to Israel",2023-11-22,Fox News,['Joseph A. Wulfsohn'],"Comedic actor blasted Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., as ‘disgusting’ and the Democratic 'Squad' as ‘horribly antisemitic’ during an interview with Fox News Digital about the Israel-Hamas war. 
EXCLUSIVE: Comedic actor and outspoken Israel supporter Jon Lovitz went on a tear against Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and members of the Democratic ""Squad"" for their opposition to the Jewish State.
Lovitz, who is Jewish, declared Sanders the ""best example"" of a ""self-loathing Jew,"" calling him ""disgusting,"" and mocked how the senator describes himself as a ""Democratic Socialist"" versus being a communist. 
""That's like asking me, ‘Are you Christian?’ 'No, no, I'm a Jew for Jesus.' Well, that's what it is,"" Lovitz told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""You know the difference between a communist and a Democratic Socialist? A Democratic Socialist is somebody you vote for, and then they take all your money and give back what they think you need. A communist — they just appoint themselves. There's no election and they do the exact same thing. That's the only difference.""
""And [Sanders is] saying, you know, we shouldn't have money for, you know, fund Israel, you know, and the Squad, those people… It's no secret they're horribly antisemitic,"" he said. 
JON LOVITZ TEARS INTO COLBERT, KIMMEL FOR PUSHING ‘POLITICAL AGENDA’ IN LATE NIGHT: THEY ‘HAMMER IT TO DEATH’
He mocked Sanders for having three homes despite his $174,000 salary as a senator.
""'That's normal.' No, it isn't. Not on that salary,"" Lovitz said while showcasing his Sanders impersonation. 
""All my friends that are Jewish, like, they go, Bernie Sanders, self-loathing Jew. You know, what's wrong with this guy? And that's what that is. 'Oh, that's not true.' Yeah, it is. Yeah, you are. 'I don't like it when people make money. It's not right. They should only make so much. And then it's enough.' Well, you have three homes. You should just have one. 'That's none of your business.'""
Lovitz slammed Sen. Bernie Sandiers, I-Vt., as a ""self-loathing Jew"" over his opposition to Israel. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)
Lovitz, who describes himself as socially liberal but fiscally conservative, lamented how Democrats had always been pro-Israel in years past, but now the party has shifted so far left that the Squad promotes the anti-Israel Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement. 
""They go, 'Let's give all that money away from Israel, give it to Hamas.' That's what they would say. That's what they want,"" Lovitz said. ""What's that, Ilhan Omar? She wants to [not] give money to Israel for military aid. They're our ally! They're a democracy! Just go — all right. You're against giving money to a Democratic ally, correct? You're against that. But we're giving money to Ukraine.""

He then turned his aim at Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., pointing to a recent Fox News Digital report revealing she's part of a secret Facebook group that praised Hamas. 
""'Free Palestine. I'm not antisemitic,' but that means you want to get rid of Israel. She's in her office — in her office, there's pictures of it. She's got a map and a post-it over Israel, it says ‘Palestine.’ I mean, she's Palestinian. I get it… but she's spreading lies,"" Lovitz said. ""She said that Israel bombed the hospital and killed 500 people. And then after they proved that Israel did not fire the bomb and the United States proved it and the bomb hit the parking lot, not the hospital, and the bomb was fired by jihad terrorists, and they have video of it where it's coming from, not from Israel, from Gaza and turning around and hitting the parking lot. She's never taken the tweet down or said I made a mistake. So how can you listen to anything she says?""
Lovitz railed against Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for peddling Hamas' false narrative debunked by Israeli and U.S. intelligence that Israel bombed a Gaza hospital, killing over 500 civilians.  (AP/Jose Luis Magana)
He continued: ""They want to get rid of Israel. 'Well, just because you want to get rid of Israel doesn't mean you're antisemitic.' Well, yeah, it kind of does because it's a Jewish state. ‘We want to get rid of the Jewish state of Israel.’ Their flag has a Jewish star on it. I mean, yeah, it is. ‘Anti-Zionism isn’t anti-Jewishness.' Yeah, it is. Of course, it is. What else could it be? It's part of being Jewish. The Jewish stars and the flag, but you're not against Jews.""
He also singled out Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., though not for her opposition to Israel.
""You know, AOC said?"" Lovitz began. ""I don't care what party she's in. I think she's cute. But she's an idiot… She goes, 'You know, 29, a lot of people my generation because of climate change are asking themselves, you know, should they have children? And I think it's a good question. And I think, you know, maybe they shouldn't.' Oh. Okay. So you're telling all the people of your generation don't have kids. Then in 50 years, there's nobody left on the Earth, moron!… This is what you're dealing with! Don't have kids. Okay. There'll be no one left to breathe your clean air. It's moronic!""

When asked why he believes there's such a divide among liberals in D.C. and Hollywood alike when it comes to the Israel-Hamas war, Lovitz replied, ""Jealousy, fear and misinformation."" 
""Before this happened, you know, 500,000 Palestinians would go to Israel for work, like they're dependent on Israel for their survival,"" he said. ""Secondly, if you want to get really technical, they're not Palestinians. They're Jordanian refugees. In 1964, Yasser Arafat changed the name to the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and started calling them Palestinians. So I've had people go, 'Well, if they're not supposed to live in Palestine, why are they called Palestinians?' So it's a propaganda thing. That's true."" 
COMEDIAN JON LOVITZ BLASTS HBO'S JOHN OLIVER FOR SHAMING U.S. OVER ALLIANCE WITH ISRAEL: ‘GOD BLESS AMERICA’
Lovitz continued, ""But the fact is that a lot of Israelis and Palestinians get along fine… Israel has 10 million citizens and 1.8 million are Arabs — Arab-Israeli citizens. They have their own political party, and you can't get anything done in the, you know, their Congress is the Knesset and everything, without their vote. And where do you think they came from? I was there in Israel in '78, and I have relatives there. And my cousin — I said, 'So what's with the Palestinians?' He goes, 'They're Jordanian refugees living in the same spot they've been living in since the '20s. And we said, you know, it's Israel now. If you stay here, you're Israeli citizens. If you leave, you know, it's up to you. But if you stay, you'll become Israeli citizens.' And that's where the 1.8 million Arabs came from — hello! And I'm not saying the Jews are perfect. They're not. No one is. They do things that are wrong. But in this case, they're not wrong.""

The ""Saturday Night Live"" alum blasted calls for a cease-fire, highlighting Hamas' own rhetoric promising future Oct. 7ths. 
""As soon as they start winning — 'Cease-fire!' How can you have a cease-fire against Hamas when Hamas says we're never stopping 'til you're all gone. 'And we're gonna have Oct. 7th. We'll have Oct. 11th and 20th, and we're going to do it over and over and over again.' And now they have all these hostages. They go, 'okay, we'll give you 70 back.' And Israel's answer, which it should be, is like, 'Go to hell. Give them all back. You shouldn't have any in the first place,'"" Lovitz said. ""And Israel — if they get rid of Hamas, they're gonna make sure that you put in, which would be good, a democratic government, you know, running Gaza. And then what would happen? Oh, they'll have education. They'll have, instead of money, the money for tunnels, you know, it'll go to build schools and hospitals. And women will get educated.""
He later added, ""I mean, it's the lack of knowledge of what's going on. And again — 'But isn't it horrible that people are getting killed in Palestine, innocent civilians?' Yes, it is horrible because it's war. War is horrible. But Israel, it's a war that Hamas — their government deliberately started. They go, ‘We wanted to start a war'... Hamas doesn't care about all these people getting killed. Israel says leave and Hamas is no, don't leave. They try to prevent them from leaving. What's that?""

Top progressive Jayapal slammed by fellow House Dems for downplaying Hamas rape accusations,2023-12-04,Fox News,['Elizabeth Elkind'],"Rep. Pramila Jayapal warned President Biden to be ""careful"" about his support for Israel on Sunday during an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on ""Meet the Press.""
The top progressive lawmaker in the House is being criticized by fellow Democrats for downplaying Hamas terrorists’ reported sexual violence against Israeli women. 
Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was accused of trying to find a moral equivalence between Hamas and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) during a Sunday television interview.
""Hamas terrorists raped Israeli women and girls. The only ‘balanced’ approach is to condemn sexual violence loudly, forcefully and without exceptions. Outrageous for anyone to ‘both sides’ sexual violence,"" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., wrote on X Sunday evening.
Credible accounts of rape and brutal sexual assault are beginning to surface in the wake of Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which saw roughly 1,200 men, women and children killed in their homes and elsewhere. There are also concerns over whether sexual violence is still being carried out on the dozens of Israelis still held hostage by Hamas.

Jayapal was asked about progressive women’s silence on the issue when the same group is historically among the most vocal about matters of sexual violence.
""I mean, I don’t, I don’t know that that’s true. I think we always talk about the impact of war on women, in particular,"" Jayapal said on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" adding that she has condemned Hamas since Oct. 7.
Then she added, ""We have to remember that Israel is a democracy. That is why they are a strong ally of ours. And if they do not comply with international humanitarian law, they are bringing themselves to a place that makes it much more difficult strategically for them to be able to build the kinds of allies to keep public opinion with them. And frankly, morally, I think we cannot say that one war crime deserves another. That is not what international humanitarian law says.""

""I said it's horrific, and I think that rape is horrific. Sexual assault is horrific. I think that it happens in war situations. Terrorist organizations like Hamas, obviously are using these as tools,"" Jayapal said. ""However, I think we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians – 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, three-quarters of whom are women and children.""
Her comments were also criticized by Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., who did not directly name Jayapal but said on Sunday night, ""Rape and sexual violence against Israeli women calls for nothing less than unequivocal condemnation.""

"UN still does not label, sanction Hamas as terror group despite murderous attacks",2023-10-13,Fox News,['Adam Shaw'],"Israeli Defense Forces says Hamas terrorists are using the roofs of residential homes to launch UAVs.
As Israel reels from the deadliest terror attack in years by Hamas, the United Nations Security Council still does not recognize or sanction Hamas as a terror group — despite multiple other nations declaring it to be so.
""The U.N. Security Council votes to impose sanctions and designations on groups like al Qaeda, the Taliban or ISIS. But no such sanctions or designations exist for Iran’s axis of terror groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah,"" Richard Goldberg, senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital. 
The Council, under resolutions passed in 1999, 2011 and 2015, sanctions ISIS and al Qaeda, along with associated individuals and groups. The Council’s committee on those resolutions oversees sanctions measured imposed by the council.
ISRAEL AMBASSADOR SLAMS UN COUNCIL'S STATEMENT CRITICIZING ISRAEL: ‘HOW MANY MURDERED JEWS DOES IT TAKE’

However, there are no such sanctions in place for Hamas and Hezbollah. The lack of sanctioning comes as Israel is pushing back against Hamas after it was hit by a surprise attack that killed more than 1,300 Israelis. 
""The U.N. insists these are legitimate political movements and therefore can freely work with them,"" said Goldberg, who previously served as the director for countering weapons of destruction at the White House National Security Council between 2019 and 2020.
Israeli and U.S. officials have criticized the U.N., including the Security Council — which is made up of 15 members, including permanent membership for the U.S., the U.K., France, China and Russia — for allegedly having an anti-Israel bias. During the Trump administration, then-Ambassador Nikki Haley introduced a resolution in 2018 to label Hamas as a terror group, but it received only one vote in favor — that of the U.S. An attempt to have the U.N. General Assembly condemn Hamas was also unsuccessful.
Russia and its veto power often form a roadblock on the Council for any action against Iran and Iran-backed entities. The Associated Press reported this week that the U.S. demanded the Council condemn ""these heinous terrorist attacks committed by Hamas,"" but no immediate action was taken.

SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL ADMITS ISRAEL ATTACKS HAD BEEN PLANNED FOR YEARS UNDER GUISE OF GOVERNING GAZA
U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood said afterward that ""a good number of countries"" did condemn the atrocity but not all council members.
Israeli Ambassador Gilad Erdan has criticized the U.N. reaction to the attack against Israel. In a Tuesday statement, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk called for both Israel Defense Forces and Hamas to ""respect international humanitarian law"" and defuse tensions. He also criticized Israel's ""full siege"" of Gaza.
""The U.N.'s response to Israel's early warning to the residents of Gaza is shameful,"" Erdan told Fox News Digital. ""For many years, the U.N. has turned a blind eye to the arming of Hamas and its use of the civilian population and civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip as a hiding place for its weapons and murder.
""Now, instead of standing by Israel, whose citizens were slaughtered by Hamas terrorists and who tries to minimize harm to those not involved, it preaches to Israel. It is better for the U.N. to focus now on returning the hostages, condemning Hamas, and supporting Israel's right to defend itself.""
Goldberg, meanwhile, said that the failure of the Council to designate Hamas a terror group has knock-on effects on other agencies — including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) when vetting staff.

""There is zero requirement for UNRWA to submit its list of staff and beneficiaries for U.S. counterterrorism vetting. They use their own lists instead and wouldn’t you know it, since Hamas isn’t a U.N. terror group they magically find no evidence of support for terrorism,"" he said.
An email sent to the spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary General was not immediately returned by press time.

"Harvard students stage march, ‘die-in’ blaming Israel for hospital blast, ‘genocide’ in Gaza",2023-10-18,Fox News,['Gabriel Hays'],"Multiple pro-Palestinian student groups hosted a march and ""die-in"" at Harvard Business School recently in protest of Israel’s ""genocide"" of Palestinians in Gaza.
Multiple pro-Palestinian student groups hosted a march and ""die-in"" at Harvard Business School Wednesday in protest of Israel’s ""genocide"" of Palestinians in Gaza.
Just over a week after Hamas terrorists killed more than 1,300 people in Israel, two Harvard student groups – the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee and Harvard Graduate Students for Palestine – organized a march from Harvard's main campus in Cambridge to its business school in Boston to protest Israel’s alleged mistreatment of innocent Palestinians in Gaza.
The crowd of pro-Palestinian Harvard students marched from one Harvard campus to the other with signs and banners, one reading, ""Stop the genocide in Gaza,"" while chanting slogans like, ""Hey! Hey! You can’t hide, we charge you with genocide."" Chants of ""F--- Harvard Business School"" could be heard from the marchers as well. 
HUNDREDS KILLED IN BLAST AT GAZA STRIP HOSPITAL; ISRAEL SAYS ISLAMIC JIHAD'S 'FAILED ROCKET LAUNCH' TO BLAME
Multiple angles of pro-Palestinian protests at Harvard Business School on Wednesday, Oct. 18. (Fox News)
In a video shared to the Palestine Solidarity Committee’s Instagram shortly after the rally, protestors could be seen performing their die-in on the business school grounds, which involved each protestor lying on the ground in solidarity the Palestinian people they accused Israel of murdering.
Posters advertising the die-in before the event revealed that student groups were motivated at least in part by Hamas' claim that Israel bombed a hospital in Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians.
One flyer read advertising the event read, ""Protest and Die-In. Over 800 Killed by Israeli airstrike on hospital in Gaza. Demand an end to ongoing genocide.""
Despite early media reports and American politicians repeating Hamas' claim that an Israeli airstrike struck the hospital and killed hundreds of innocent people, an Israeli Defense Force investigation stated that the explosion was the result of a failed Islamic Jihad rocket intended for Israeli targets that landed near the hospital in Gaza. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the Biden administration's current assessment is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital. 
""While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,"" she wrote.
As the Harvard rally continued, it was met by pro-Israeli counterprotesters. More footage from a student videographer captured Palestinian supporters yelling, ""Let Gaza live!""
One student holding an Israeli flag could be heard telling Palestinian supporters to have Hamas stop abusing innocent Gazans under their control. ""Let them live! Go tell your terrorists to let Gazans live! You’re right.""
Pro-Palestinian students were heard shouting back, ""You’re the terrorists!""

MEDIA ACCUSED OF PARROTING HAMAS' TALKING POINTS ON GAZA HOSPITAL BLAST, IDF SPOX SAYS TERROR GROUP ‘LYING’
Another video shared on Harvard's Palestine Solidarity Committee’s Instagram alleged that the students were protesting former President Obama’s visit to the business school that day. 
Obama, who recently put out a message supporting Israel following the Hamas attack, canceled his trip to the school due to COVID-19 symptoms. He was set to appear at the launch of a new lab at Harvard Law School.
Harvard University has been the center of controversy ever since the Hamas attack on Israel, with pro-Palestinian student groups releasing a joint statement claiming Israel was ""entirely responsible"" for Hamas’ attack. It said, ""Today's events did not occur in a vacuum. For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison.""

The letter prompted Harvard alumnus and billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, to demand Harvard release the names of the student member of the more than 30 student groups that signed the statement, so that he and other CEOs do not ""inadvertently hire any"" of them after graduation. 
Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer recently announced that he and his wife were resigning from the Harvard Kennedy School's executive board because of the school president not sufficiently condemning students over the letter. 
The pro-Palestinian student groups and Harvard University and its business school have yet to respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

"AOC lauds pro-Palestinian 'activism,' accuses US of aiding 'gross' human rights abuse in Gaza",2023-11-28,Fox News,['Elizabeth Elkind'],"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spoke with voters at a tele-town hall on Monday where she fielded questions about her and other progressive lawmakers' efforts to pressure President Biden to rein in Israel's retaliation over Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused the Biden administration of enabling ""gross human rights violations"" in Gaza by sending military aid to Israel as it seeks to eradicate Hamas.
The progressive lawmaker held a tele-town hall on Monday evening where she fielded multiple questions on the Middle Eastern conflict, including a constituent who said the U.S. should ""just defund Israel and send funding and aid to Gaza.""
She also encouraged pro-Palestinian activists to keep putting pressure on Democratic lawmakers to support a cease-fire, even as heightened tensions around the issue have led to instances of vandalism and threatening behavior. 
""Forces that are recipients of U.S. military aid cannot be engaging in gross human rights violations,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, citing a set of statutes known as the Leahy law. ""And if they are engaged in gross human rights violations, then that aid must be either pulled, reconsidered, conditioned, etc.""

The Leahy law stops the government ""from using funds for assistance to units of foreign security forces where there is credible information implicating that unit in the commission of gross violations of human rights,"" according to the State Department.
""What we are witnessing is the gross violation of human rights in Gaza, and that is being done with U.S. military assistance,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""I don't think that the American people want to see our public resources going to finance gross human rights violations.""

At another point, a caller asked what Americans who support a cease-fire should do to keep pressuring lawmakers. Ocasio-Cortez replied, ""I want to also be clear about how powerful that is, constituent engagement.""
She said the flood of calls and messages from pro-Palestinian activists to pro-Israel Democrats was increasing support for a cease-fire.

""These are not just progressives,"" she said. ""We have seen representatives from swing seats, that just barely won their seats, are now starting to come out in favor of a cease-fire. So all of this activism is making this a politically tenable and a politically normalized position. So I want to encourage individuals who are, you know, making that call or perhaps if you haven't made that call yet, to please do so.""

But some of that pressure has led to heightened security concerns when the activism goes beyond phone calls. Rep. Daniel Goldman, D-N.Y., who is Jewish, saw his Brooklyn office vandalized earlier this month with pro-Palestinian messaging. 
And a demonstration outside the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters grew so heated that one Democratic lawmaker who was inside at the time compared it to the violent Jan. 6, 2021, protest at the U.S. Capitol.

White House interns demand that Biden seek a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in a letter,2023-12-06,Fox News,['Jeffrey Clark'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the ground from Sderot, Israel.
Interns at the White House are urging that President Biden push for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, according to a letter shared with NBC News. 
""The letter, first shared with NBC News and addressed to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, is supported by more than 40 interns who work in the White House and other executive branch offices, according to the text,"" the outlet reported. 
""We, the undersigned Fall 2023 White House and Executive Office of the President interns, will no longer remain silent on the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people,"" the interns wrote, although none put their actual names on the letter.

""We are Palestinian, Jewish, Arab, Muslim, Christian, Black, Asian, Latine, White, and Queer. We heed the voices of the American people and call on the Administration to demand a permanent ceasefire,"" the letter continued. ""We are not the decision makers of today, but we aspire to be the leaders of tomorrow, and we will never forget how the pleas of the American people have been heard and thus far, ignored."" 
The White House interns also wrote that they decided to work for the Biden administration believing in ""shared values"" and a nation of ""justice and peace,"" but criticized the Israeli government for ""ongoing violence"" and ""dehumanizing rhetoric targeting Muslims and Arabs."" 
Multiple prominent Democratic politicians have called on Biden to demand a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez., D-N.Y., personally leading at least two dozen other Democrats in cease-fire demands.

""We write to you to express deep concern about the intensifying war in Gaza, particularly grave violations against children, and our fear that without an immediate cessation of hostilities and the establishment of a robust bilateral ceasefire, this war will lead to a further loss of civilian life and risk dragging the United States into dangerous and unwise conflict with armed groups across the Middle East,"" the progressive lawmaker wrote.
The White House interns, however, chose to remain anonymous in their letter to Biden, leading to some withering mockery online. Noah Rothman, writing in National Review, argued he should fire all the interns in response.
Biden blamed Hamas for the collapse of a temporary cease-fire agreement on Tuesday. While at a political fundraiser in Boston, the president called on the world to condemn the ""unimaginable cruelty"" of Hamas' sexual violence ""without exception."" 
""Reports of women raped — repeatedly raped — and their bodies being mutilated while still alive, of women's corpses being desecrated, Hamas terrorists inflicting as much pain and suffering on women and girls as possible and then murdering them. It is appalling,"" Biden said, according to Reuters.
The Biden administration did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

North Korea backs Hamas against Israeli ‘criminal actions’,2023-10-10,Fox News,['Timothy H.J. Nerozzi'],"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
North Korea is supporting Hamas in the group's terrorist attacks against Israel.
Media reports in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are voicing support for the terror group against Israeli military and civilians.
""A large scale armed conflict has occurred between Hamas of Palestine and Israel,"" read the Rodong Sinmun, a state-affilitated news outlet run by the Workers' Party of North Korea.

""The international community calls the conflict the consequence of Israel's ceaseless criminal actions against the people of Palestine,"" the report adds.
Israel said Tuesday it has reclaimed control of the Gaza border as IDF forces pound densely-populated districts with the fiercest airstrikes in the 75-year history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Israel has vowed to take its ""mighty revenge"" since gunmen rampaged through its towns, leaving streets strewn with bodies in by far the deadliest attack in its history. It has called up hundreds of thousands of reservists and placed the Gaza Strip, crowded home to 2.3 million people, under a total siege.

North Korean outlets said an independent Palestinian state was the ""fundamental"" solution to the conflict.
Israeli media said the death toll from the Hamas attacks had climbed to 900 people, mostly civilians gunned down in their homes, on the streets or at a dance party, dwarfing the scale of any past attack by Islamists apart from 9/11. Scores of Israelis were taken to Gaza as hostages, with some paraded through the streets.

"US, partners discussing foreign troops serving as Gaza peacekeeping force after Israeli war: report",2023-11-02,Fox News,['Danielle Wallace'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the Israel-Hamas war from southern Israel. 
The United States and its partners are reportedly discussing sending foreign troops to Gaza to serve as an ""international peacekeeping force"" in the region currently controlled by Hamas militants following the war in Israel. 
Two U.S. senators confirmed the early, closed-door talks to Politico, though it is unclear if negotiations including potential sending American troops. 
""There certainly has been discussion with the Saudi about their being part of some international peacekeeping force if only to provide resources, and, longer term, supporting Palestinian leadership and a separate state, obviously,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Politico. ""Reconstruction of Gaza will require a vast amount of resources, which the Saudis potentially could help provide.""

""I’m not sure how active the conversation is about U.S. troops,"" Blumenthal added, speaking of the discussions he had with the congressional delegation with whom he traveled to Israel last month. ""I would think that maybe an international force could be mustered without U.S. troops.""
""There are ongoing conversations regarding the possible composition of an international force,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., also told Politico, reportedly declining to go into detail. ""They are very preliminary and fragile.""
""I do think it’d be important to have some kind of multinational force in Gaza as a transition to whatever comes next,"" he added.

Rubio to introduce Senate resolution canceling visas for Hamas supporters,2023-10-17,Fox News,['Jamie Joseph'],"Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says Hamas 'needs to be dismantled' after its terrorist attack in Israel on 'Your World.'
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is leading a resolution Tuesday to deport foreigners and cancel their visas if they support the Islamic militant group Hamas.
Rubio's office told Fox News Digital he would be hotlining the resolution — meaning he will request unanimous consent to pass the resolution without going through the usual formalities of a full debate and vote on the floor.
According to the resolution text, it requests that the president ""revoke visas and initiate deportation proceedings for any foreign national who has endorsed or espoused the terrorist activities of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah,"" or other terrorist groups in the attacks against Israel last week.
The resolution also states that Hamas ""terrorists operated death squads tasked with exterminating Jews, as well as hostage-taking squads tasked with abducting Jews for ransom, propaganda, and torture, if not [for] simply sadistic pleasure.""

Citing a former Hamas leader's call for a ""Day of Rage"" on Oct. 13, the resolution said some in the U.S. responded to this call and ""incited others"" to endorse Hamas. ""Antisemitic"" protests and riots in South Florida, Washington, D.C., New York City, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, were also cited.
""America is the most generous nation on earth, but we cannot allow foreign nationals who support terrorist groups like Hamas and march in our streets calling for ‘intifada’ to enter or stay in our country,"" Rubio said in a statement. 
The resolution comes as universities including Harvard, University of California, Los Angeles, Columbia University and the University of Virginia blamed Israel for the attacks. Harvard alone had 34 student groups write in a letter the ""Israeli regime"" was ""entirely responsible"" for the ""unfolding violence"" in Israel.
The Harvard student organizations' statement, released on the day of the Hamas attacks, also said the events did not occur ""in a vacuum.""
A pro-Palestinian chapter at the University of California, Berkeley also said they ""invariably reject Israel’s framing as a victim.""

Rubio's resolution follows his letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday, in which he first called for visas to be revoked from foreigners who support Hamas. 
In a separate letter sent to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also demanded the department take immediate action to remove the foreign nationals, who the GOP lawmaker says have ""no place"" in the U.S.
""I write to urge you to immediately deport any foreign national — including and especially any alien on a student visa — that has expressed support for Hamas and its murderous attacks on Israel. These fifth-columnists have no place in the United States,"" Cotton wrote.

""We probably didn’t know that about them. No one’s going to tell you, ‘I’m a Hamas supporter,’ on the way in. But once we know you are, our laws say you shouldn’t have a visa, and you need to go. … We should not have people inside of our country who are here as visitors, foreign nationals, who then take to the streets and call for supporting this terrorist organization that just butchered babies, slaughtered innocents, and took hostages, including Americans, into Gaza,"" he said.

Israel should take responsibility
 for protecting innocent civilians in Gaza even though Hamas is using them as human shields, Biden administration national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday, as Israeli forces continue to bombard the Gaza Strip following the deadly terrorist attack more than three weeks ago.
Sullivan appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" saying the Israeli government should take every possible action to distinguish terrorists from civilians during its ongoing operations.
""Hamas is making life extremely difficult for Israel by taking civilians as human shields and putting their rocket infrastructure and terrorist infrastructure among civilians,"" Sullivan said. ""That creates an added burden for Israel, but it does not lessen Israel’s responsibility under international humanitarian law to distinguish between terrorist and civilians and protect lives of innocent people.""
Sullivan added: ""And that is the overwhelming majority of the people in Gaza.""

Since the Oct. 7 attacks committed by Hamas against Israel, protests have broken out across the world seemingly supporting the terror group and condemning the Jewish State, which is still reeling from the murder of over 1,400 Israelis.
But perhaps the most extreme displays from the Hamas-sympathizing supporters are coming from American college campuses.
Here are some examples of the jarring actions and rhetoric coming from both students and professors alike.

More than 30 student groups at Harvard co-signed a letter declaring they ""hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.""
New York University students were caught tearing down posters of Israeli hostages Oct. 16 outside the university's Tisch Hall.
University of California-Davis assistant professor Jemma Decristo had an ominous message appearing to threaten what she called ""Zionist journalists"" and their families.
A bizarre incident was reported out of Stanford University where an instructor allegedly asked Jewish and Israeli students to identify themselves. Three students told Rabbi Dov Greenberg, director of the Chabad Stanford Jewish Center, that the instructor told them to gather their belongings and stand in the corner because ""this is what Israel does to the Palestinians.""

Faced with spiking antisemitism and flaring tensions following Hamas’ attacks on Israel, Jews in Los Angeles are increasingly turning to gun ownership, self-defense classes and armed security for safety, according to a rabbi who has been training Jewish religious leaders for years.
""Growing up Orthodox, people hating Jews has been a part of my life,"" Rabbi Yossi Eilfort, a former MMA fighter, told Fox News Digital in a recent phone interview. ""A lot of people complain; I want people to act. And so I was trying to inspire people to take some level of action.""
Eilfort is the founder of Magen Am USA, the only Jewish, nonprofit organization licensed on the West Coast to provide armed security services.
His nonprofit, which operates in LA and Phoenix, trains volunteers and community members in extensive classes on gun safety, hand-to-hand self-defense, de-escalation, verbal tactics and the use of intermediate weapons such as Tasers or batons.
Eilfort was a full-time rabbi until 2020, when calls to defund the police reverberated across America following the death of George Floyd, igniting social justice protests and riots at a time when the coronavirus and lockdowns upended society.

Eilfort’s security teams stepped in and assisted with preventing home invasions as police contended with a local crime wave, he said. By May of that year, he devoted his time completely to Magen Am and helping ensure that schools, synagogues and other Jewish centers were protected from potential attacks and crime.
Since then, he’s ""100%"" seen an increase among Jews in the LA area embracing the Second Amendment, he said.

Saudi Arabia’s defense minister is set to visit the White House this week in a bid to tamp down regional tensions in the Middle East after the kingdom reportedly shot down a missile fired from Yemen that was intended for Israel.

""I can tell you that Saudi Arabia wants to make sure that the U.S. fully understands the humongous ramifications of the Israeli ground invasion into Gaza,"" Salman Al-Ansari, an independent Saudi Arabian geopolitical analyst, told Fox News Digital. ""Riyad wants D.C. to think critically and to not fall into supporting decisions that may fire back at the U.S. interests and the whole region.""
Saudi Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman is set to visit Washington on Monday to talk with senior Biden administration officials, Axios reported after speaking with three sources with knowledge of the trip. Bin Salman, the brother of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and former ambassador to the U.S., would be the highest-ranking Saudi official to visit Washington since Biden took office.
The meetings will include national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and several others, according to the report.

Saudi Arabia warned Saturday that ""any ground operation by Israel would threaten the lives of Palestinian civilians and result in inhumane dangers.""

The White House said Sunday it ""vigorously condemns"" the group of pro-Palestinian rioters in Russia who flooded an airport as they were shouting antisemitic chants and reportedly searching for passengers from a flight that departed from Tel Aviv, Israel.
The airport, located in the city of Makhachkala in the Republic of Dagestan, closed after rioters began flooding the runway Sunday night, Russian aviation authority Rosaviatsia reported. All other flights headed toward Makhachkala were diverted.
In the first public comment
 made by the Biden administration since the incident, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the U.S. condemns the ""antisemitic protests"" at the airport in Russia.
""The United States vigorously condemns the antisemitic protests in Dagestan, Russia,"" Watson wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The U.S. unequivocally stands with the entire Jewish community as we witness a worldwide surge in antisemitism. There is never any excuse or justification for antisemitism.""
Many users on X blasted Watson's post for referring to the riot as a ""protest,"" with some people replying that the correct term would be ""pogrom,"" which means attacks on particular ethnic groups, particularly Jewish people.

The Israeli Defense Forces said Monday morning that its ground attack in Gaza expanded overnight.
""An IAF aircraft—guided by ground forces—struck a Hamas post and the 20+ terrorist operatives in it,"" the IDF wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
""Soldiers spotted armed terrorists and an anti-tank missile launching post near the Al-Azhar University and guided an IAF fighter jet to strike them,"" the post continued.

The IDF added that its forces ""eliminated multiple terrorists barricaded within civilian buildings and terrorist tunnels who attempted to attack the forces.""

President Biden had a phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday morning, with the two leaders discussing ongoing airstrikes in Gaza.
According to the White House, Biden reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense, but cautioned to defend itself in a humanitarian way.
""The President reiterated that Israel has every right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism and underscored the need to do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of civilians,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The President and Prime Minister discussed ongoing efforts to locate and secure the release of hostages, to include American citizens who remain unaccounted for and may be held by Hamas.""

""The President underscored the need to immediately and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of civilians in Gaza,"" the statement added. ""The President and the Prime Minister agreed to remain in regular consultation both directly and through their respective national security teams.""
The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reported that at least 8,005 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, including more than 3,000 minors and 2,000 women. At least 1,400 Israelis have been murdered, mostly civilians.

Jordan, a Middle Eastern country that is allied with the United States and has had peaceful relations with its neighbor Israel since 1994, has asked the American government to deploy Patriot air defense systems amid the Israel-Hamas war.
The request comes as the country is threatened with regional conflict as a result of Hamas' terrorists' attack on Israel on October 7. The country's leaders worry that Israel's airstrikes in Gaza could threaten the entire Levant.
""We asked the American side to help bolster our defense system with Patriot air defense missile systems,"" Jordanian military spokesperson Brigadier General Mustafa Hiyari confirmed.
The U.S. stationed Patriot missiles in Jordan in 2013 when unrest in Syria - Jordan's northern neighbor - became a concern for the kingdom. The Patriot, a sophisticated air defense system, is highly sought-after by American allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Makhachkala riots on Sunday night, in which a group of anti-Israeli protestors stormed a Russian airport and reportedly yelled anti-Semitic statements.

""Appalling videos from Makhachkala, Russia, where an angry mob broke into the airport searching for Israeli citizens on the flight from Tel-Aviv,"" Zelenskyy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
""This is not an isolated incident in Makhachkala, but rather part of Russia’s widespread culture of hatred toward other nations, which is propagated by state television, pundits, and authorities,"" he continued.
Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, then accused high-ranking Russian officials of harboring hatred towards Jews.
""The Russian foreign minister has made a series of antisemitic remarks in the last year. The Russian President also used antisemitic slurs,"" the Ukrainian leader explained. ""For Russian propaganda talking heads on official television, hate rhetoric is routine. Even the most recent Middle East escalation prompted antisemitic statements from Russian ideologists.""

""Russian antisemitism and hatred toward other nations are systemic and deeply rooted,"" he added. ""Hatred is what drives aggression and terror. We must all work together to oppose hatred.""


A group of Pro-Palestinian rioters stormed an airport in southwestern Russia Sunday night while chanting anti-Israel comments, searching for passengers on a flight from Tel Aviv, according to Russian aviation authority Rosaviatsia. 
""It is terrifying to think what could be happening to Russian Jews again. For 20 years, Putin has pursued largely a pro-Jewish, pro-Israel policies. If he doesn’t do it right, this will spill over and destabilize Muslim populated regions in Russia and may even spark terrorism in bigger cities again,"" Foreign affairs expert Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital.
Koffler added that the situation ""could be a big problem for Putin"" if the protests are not contained.

According to Rosaviatsia, the airport, which is in the city of Makhachkala in the Republic of Dagestan, closed after rioters began flooding the runway, ""isolating"" a small number of Jews.

Telecommunications providers in Gaza have reported that residents are getting their phone and Internet service back, two days after it was abruptly cut off.
The blackout began on Friday night amid the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)'s expansion of their ground operations in the Gaza Strip. Only a small number of Palestinians with international SIM cards or satellite phone service were able to get online or call.
Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org confirmed that Internet service was restored by Sunday night.

The number of confirmed hostages in Gaza has risen to 239 people, as the war between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas terrorists enters its fourth week.
The figure is an increase from the previously estimated number of 229 captives. The majority of the hostages are Israelis, but at least 10 are believed to be American citizens. 54 of the hostages are Thai, according to the Israeli government.
The Israeli government has made it a central goal to rescue the hostages, which were taken after Hamas began attacking on October 7. Only four captives have been released so far.

The IDF has been intensifying its airstrikes against the Gaza Strip, where residents have struggled with securing food and basic items. Hamas's health ministry estimates that over 7,300 Palestinians have been killed.

The Bashar Al-Assad regime in Syria, who has been ridiculed by members of the Syrian opposition, says that they have no right to weep for Palestinians in Gaza as thousands of Syrian-Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed and imprisoned as the war on Hamas continues, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).
""They murdered Palestinian children in the Al-Yarmouk [refugee camp] in Rif Damascus – and now are pretending they weep for those in Gaza. This is the nature of the Syrian regime, and its bullies who trade in [the Palestinian cause],"" Syrian activist Marea Othman wrote on X.
Many people took to social media arguing that no help for Gaza should be expected from the Syrian regime that had murdered many Syrians and Palestinians in Syria.

Israeli Minister of Defense
 Yoav Gallant met with Israeli hostages' families amid the country's war against Hamas on Sunday.
Gallant told the families that Israel ""is determined to win the war,"" which began on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah on October 7, when Hamas terrorists assaulted Israeli villages and massacred civilians including children.
“It was important for me to meet and hear from you. Returning the hostages and tracking missing Israelis is a mission of utmost importance,"" Gallant said. ""I have two goals: returning those who were kidnapped and winning this war.""
""All the rest is less important right now,"" he added.
The official also accused Hamas of conducting psychological warfare regarding their communications about the captives.

“The stories published by Hamas are part of their psychological games – and these take a heavy toll on the entire nation of Israel,"" he explained. ""Hamas is cynically using those who are dear to us – they understand the pain and the pressure.”

Israeli ambassador confirms Biden-Netanyahu call as Israel enters 'second stage' of Gaza invasion

Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Herzog confirmed that President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone Sunday morning.
Herzog confirmed the call during an appearance on Fox News, saying 
the two leaders remained in constant contact. Neither the U.S. nor Israel has offered details regarding the pair's conversation, but it comes as the Israeli military is entering the ""second stage"" of its war against Hamas.
Israeli Defense Forces had relied mostly on airstrikes and artillery for the first three weeks of the war, but they are now beinging extensive ground operations in northern Gaza.
Biden's administration has fully endorsed Israel's right to defend itself and to retaliate against Hamas for the October 7 massacre. He has urged Israel to do all it can to minimize civilian casualties, however.


Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday said he stands by the decision to decertify any pro-Palestinian student groups that side with Hamas from state college campuses, arguing that to allow these groups to openly side with ""brutal terrorist organizations"" is like committing ""suicide as a country.""
DeSantis, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate, appeared on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" saying that the pro-Palestinian solidarity group had also claimed to be part of the Hamas movement.
""This is not cancel culture, this group, they themselves said in the aftermath of the Hamas attack that they don't just stand in solidarity, that they are part of this Hamas movement,"" he said. ""And so, yeah, you have a right to go out and demonstrate, but you can't provide material support to terrorism. They've linked themselves to Hamas, and so we absolutely decertified them.""

Last week, the chancellor of the state’s university system penned a letter stating that a student group present in at least two universities in the Florida system, known as National Students for Justice in Palestine (National SJP), published a ""toolkit"" that refers to the Hamas operation as ""the resistance"" and says that ""Palestinian students in exile are PART of this movement, not in solidarity with this movement.""
DeSantis said he believes the move is ""totally justified within the law,"" which states that it is a felony under Florida law to knowingly provide material aid or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. 

""Their own words are saying they're part of this organization, that they don't just stand in solidarity, that they don't just support what they did, but that this is their movement, too,"" DeSantis said. ""So once you hitch your wagon to a group like Hamas, that takes you out of the realm of normal activity, and that's something that we're going to take action against.""

The future of Gaza could be ""tremendous"" if the region is placed under the correct leadership, former President Donald Trump's son in law, Jared Kushner, said Sunday.
Kushner made the statement during a Sunday appearance on Fox News after returning from a trip to Saudi Arabia. Kushner, who helped negotiate the Abraham Accords under Trump's administration, says there remains enthusiasm in Saudi Arabia for the normalization of ties with Israel.
""If only there was proper leadership that cared more about creating opportunity for their people than trying to destroy Israel and perpetuate antisemitism, the possibilities could be really tremendous,"" Kushner said.

He added that the Saudis remain concerned for the wellbeing of innocent Palestinians in Gaza as Israel ramps up the second stage of its campaign against Hamas.

White House says Israel should protect Gaza civilians despite Hamas using them as human shields

Israel should take responsibility for protecting innocent civilians in Gaza even though Hamas is using them as human shields, Biden administration national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday, as Israeli forces continue to bombard the Gaza Strip following the deadly terrorist attack more than three weeks ago.

Sullivan appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" saying the Israeli government should take every possible action to distinguish terrorists from civilians during its ongoing operations.
""Hamas is making life extremely difficult for Israel by taking civilians as human shields and putting their rocket infrastructure and terrorist infrastructure among civilians,"" Sullivan said. ""That creates an added burden for Israel, but it does not lessen Israel’s responsibility under international humanitarian law to distinguish between terrorist and civilians and protect lives of innocent people.""
Sullivan added: ""And that is the overwhelming majority of the people in Gaza.""
While Sullivan said President Biden will speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later Sunday about protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he added that the U.S. has already been holding conversations behind closed doors about protecting civilians.

Sen. Lankford warns delay in Gaza invasion will only benefit Hamas

Sen. Hames Lankford, R-Ok., says any delay to Israel plans begin a ground invasion of Gaza will ultimately benefit Hamas.
Lankford made teh statement during a Sunday morning appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" with host Jake tapper. Tapper asked the senator whether a delay was wise and whether an invasion could trigger the killings of Israeli hostages in Gaza.
""Hamas has about 500 miles' worth of tunnels underneath all of the area in Gaza. So it's a very complicated environment to be able to hide hostages. Right now, Israel is trying to be able to bombard some of those areas. They know where there is Hamas fighters, where there are leadership, and where there are key whether ammunition depot, missile storage, or, obviously, where their military typically functions underground,"" Lankford wrote.
""But going after hostages is incredibly difficult in an urban environment, because no one knows where they are. Hamas is obviously trickling them out...But if you stop right now and if you pause, it gives opportunity for Hamas to dig in more and to be able to lay more booby traps,"" he added.
Lankford went on to acknowledge that the safety of the hostages in Gaza, numbering at least 229, is a top priority.


Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan declared that the organization has ""completely lost"" its legitimacy on Sunday.
Gilad made the comments Sunday morning on Fox News in reaction to a vote by the U.N. General Assembly
 approving a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Israel that didn't mention either Hamas or the 229 hostages currently in Gaza.
""I've been serving there [the U.N.] for three years, but I would have never drempt that after a massacre--nearly 1,500 babies and women and the elderly--the U.N. cannot even unite to condemn a designated terrorist organization similar to ISIS or even to the Nazis,"" Gilad said. ""It is something that is truly unfathomable.""
""I believe the U.N. on Friday completely lost its legitimacy, it's relevance,"" he added. ""Today, not only is the U.N. not committed to preventing atrocities, it is committed to ensuring they will happen again.""

'Squad' member warns Biden he may lose Muslim vote with response to Israel war: 'Be careful'

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., warned President Biden that his reponse to Israel's war against Hamas may cost him the votes of U.S. Muslims.
Jayapal made the comments during a Sunday morning appearance on ""Meet the Press"" with host Kristen Welker. Welker asked whether Jayapal was concerned Biden's response to the conflict could weaken his chances in the 2024 presidential election.
""I have been one of President Biden's biggest supporters. I have been proud to be a partner as he has been courageous and strong on the domestic front,"" Jayapal responded. ""The president needs to be just as courageous on this issue so that we keep the unity within our country.""
""He is, I think, going to be challenged to explain an issue of this moral significance to the American people,"" she added. ""The American people are actually quite far away from where the president and even the majority of Congress has been on Israel and Gaza.'
[Americans] support the right for Israel to defend itself and to exist, but they do not support a war crime exchanged for another war crime, and I think the president has to be careful about that. I would call on him...to bring us to a higher place,"" she finished.




U.S. four-star retired Gen. Jack Keane joined ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss Israel’s military strategy as they begin the ‘second phase’ of their war on Hamas on Sunday.

Keane blasted Hamas as a terror organization that has been in the ""hostage-taking business"" since at least the 1980s. Hamas is believed to have taken 229 hostages into Gaza during its October 7 massacre in Israel.
Israel, the U.S. and other nations have sought to negotiate the release of hostages for nearly a month.
Israeli Defense Forces say they are entering the second stage of their war against Hamas this week, greatly ramping up ground operations in Gaza.

Czech defense minister calls for her country to leave the UN after resolution omits Hamas, hostages


Czech Defense Minister Jana Černochová is calling for the Czech Republic to abandon the United Nations after the General Assembly approved a resolution calling for a ceasfire in Israel.
The resolution made no mention of Hamas nor the hundreds of hostaged the terrorist organization took during its October 7 massacre in Israel. Černochová posted on social media that the resolution indicated that her country has no place in the U.N.

""Exactly 3 weeks ago, Hamas murdered over 1400 Israelis, more victims for their population than the militant Islamist organization al-Qaeda murdered in the US on 9/11. And only 14 countries, including ours, have spoken out clearly and understandably against this unprecedented terrorist attack perpetrated by Hamas terrorists. I am ashamed of the UN. In my opinion, the Czech Republic has no place in an organization that cheers on terrorists and does not respect the fundamental right to self-defence. Let's get out,"" she wrote.
Only 14 countries voted against the ceasfire resolution: Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Fiji, Guatemala, Hungary, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga and the United States.



Hamas attack survivor pleads for release of 11-year-old Israeli hostage in Gaza

An Israeli mother who survived Hamas' brutal attack is pleading for the world to help get home the children being held captive, including her youngest son's best friend.
Hamas is believed to have taken 229 hostages during the terrorist group's Oct. 7 surprise attack, including at least 20 kids, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Gal Piechowicz suspects 11-year-old Gal Goldstein was among those, along with three of his other family members.
""I want Gal to come back and know that the whole community and all the citizens and all the world did the best that we could to bring him back home,"" Piechowicz, an Israeli mother of three, told Fox News. Kids ""should never, ever, ever be a part of a political game.""

Brown and white blindfolded teddy bears were lined up in Tel Aviv to represent the children held captive in Gaza on Wednesday. The bears appeared to be dabbed with fake blood.

Hamas-run Gaza health ministry reports Palestinian deaths have passed 8,000 in war with Israel

The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says Pelestinian deaths have passed 8,000 in the ongoing war with Israel on Sunday.

Israel and the U.S. have repeatedly rejected the accuracy of the Gaza ministry's casualty estimates, saying they are little more than Hamas propaganda. The terrorist organization has been known to inflate casualty statistics, as it appeared to do in the case of a blast at a Gaza hospital earlier this month.
Nevertheless, the organization claims that Israeli forces have killed 8,005 people since Israel begain its retaliatory campaign against Hamas on October 7. It claims most of those casualties are women and children.
The milestone comes as the Israeli military has enterd the second stage of its war on Hamas, greatly ramping up its ground operations within Gaza.
President Biden and the White House have repeatedly rejected the accuracy of Hamas' casualty statistics, with National Security Council spokesman John Kirby sparring with reporters on the topic last week.
""We all know that the Gaza Ministry of Health is just a front for Hamas, it's run by Hamas, a terrorist organization,"" Kirby responded. ""I've said it myself up here, we can't take anything coming out of Hamas, including the so-called Ministry of Health, at face value.""

UN accused of 'blood libel' against Israel, latest in long history of alleged bias against Jewish st


Allegations of recurring United Nations anti-Israel activity, including accusations that United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres seemed to rationalize Hamas' murder of 1,400 people — illustrate the world body's obsession with the Jewish state.
""Of course, (Guterres) should resign,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital. ""Many aspects of the U.N., like the Human Rights Council and UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), are either antisemitic or give cover for terrorism or both. The behavior of the secretary-general this week was shameful even by the standards of the U.N."" 
Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, on Tuesday urged Guterres to resign, ripping into the U.N. secretary-general for ostensibly rationalizing Hamas’ murder of 1,400, including Americans, Oct. 7 in Israel.
Guterres said Hamas’ attacks ""did not happen in a vacuum,"" and the ""Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. This is false. It was the opposite,"" Erdan said, describing Guterres' words as ""pure blood libel.""
Guterres responded to the criticism against him by noting in a statement outside the U.N. Security Council, ""I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statements yesterday in the Security Council. As if … as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas. This is false. It was the opposite.""
The U.N. has long faced accusations by critics of antisemitism and anti-Israel hatred.

Thousands of Gazans break into U.N. aid warehouses as Israeli operations intensify

Thousands of Palestinians broke into a United Nations aid warehouses in Gaza this weekend as the Israeli military ramped up its ground operations against Hamas.
Gaza residents looted flour and basic hygenic products from the U.N. facility, according to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA. Palestinians broke into four separate facilities across the Gaza strip on Saturday, the agency says.

UNRWA provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza. Its schools across the territory have been transformed into packed shelters housing Palestinians displaced by the conflict. Israel has allowed only a small trickle of aid to enter from Egypt, some of which was stored in one of the warehouses that was broken into, UNRWA said.
The unrest comes as the Israeli military has entered the ""second stage"" of its war against Hamas, greatly expanding its ground operations in Gaza.

Republicans push to block Hamas sympathizers from entering US in wake of Israel attack

In the wake of the Hamas terror attack against Israel, and anti-Israel protests erupting across the country, some Republicans are shifting their attention on immigration away from the border and onto stopping foreign nationals who express anti-Israel or pro-Hamas views from getting into the U.S. legally as well.
The Hamas terror attacks immediately drew attention from conservatives and Republicans to the southern border, and the risk of terrorists getting in through past Border Patrol.
However, both the attacks and protests that emerged in college campuses and cities throughout the U.S. also raised new questions about potential restrictions on legal immigration — including in the refugee process.

2024 presidential candidates and GOP lawmakers have called for the U.S. to no longer accept refugees from Gaza. Reps. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., and Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., introduced legislation that would block anyone from Gaza being admitted as a refugee, while multiple 2024 candidates have promised to do the same.
""I don’t know what Biden’s going to do, but we cannot accept people from Gaza into this country as refugees,"" presidential candidate Ron DeSantis said during an event. ""If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they are all antisemitic. None of them believe in Israel’s right to exist.""
""We aren’t bringing in anyone from Gaza,"" former President Donald Trump said recently.

UN food program chief says organization lost communication with humanitarian teams in Gaza


The United Nations' World Food Programme said Saturday the humanitarian organization has lost contact with their aid teams in Gaza amid the ongoing war between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists.
""The silence is deafening,"" WFP chief Cindy McCain wrote on X. ""As conflict rages on, I am extremely worried for the safety of all humanitarian workers and civilians. We are at a tipping point. Humanity must prevail.""
This comes during Israel's continued expansion of its ground attack against Gaza after cutting communications to the region. The residents of Gaza are now left without cellphone or radio service as Israeli forces attack Hamas from the ground, sea and air.

""With communications cut in #Gaza, our lifesaving food assistance is at a standstill. We cannot reach staff and partners, or the people who rely on us,"" McCain said in another post on X. ""We urgently need the ability to operate and sustained access for humanitarian assistance. Every minute counts.""


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday announced that his forces have entered the ""second stage"" of its war with the terrorist group Hamas, calling the fight a ""second War of Independence.""

""The war inside the Gaza Strip will be long and difficult, and we are prepared for it,"" Netanyahu said during a press conference in the evening, local time. ""This is our second War of Independence.""
""The war inside the Gaza Strip will be long and difficult, and we are prepared for it,"" he added, saying that the war is now ""my life's mission.""
Netanyahu spoke at the end of a difficult week for Israel, with more discussion and frustration on both sides of the conflict as some world leaders called for a humanitarian pause or a ceasefire. The United Nations voted on several motions and passed one calling for a ceasefire, which Israel outright rejected and labeled ""despicable.""

Tension remained high as Israel continued to make incursions into Gaza ahead of a much-anticipated ground invasion: Allies had reportedly urged Israel to hold back while negotiations over the 220 hostages dragged on, which frustrated Israeli leadership who accused Hamas of using the negotiations to delay and regroup.
Instead of a wide-scale ground invasion, Netanyahu announced Saturday the ""second phase of the war, whose goals are clear: The destruction of Hamas’s military and governmental capabilities, and the return of the hostages home.""
""We decided to expand ground operations unanimously – both in the War Cabinet and in the political-security cabinet,"" Netanyahu said. ""We did so in a prudent and informed manner, out of a commitment to ensuring the fate of the state and ensuring the safety of our soldiers.""

""We did so in a prudent and informed manner, out of a commitment to ensuring the fate of the state and ensuring the safety of our soldiers,"" he continued. ""The commanders and fighters who are now fighting in enemy territory know that the people, and the leadership of the people, stand behind them.""
Netanyahu invoked the history of the Jewish people, recalling Joshua Ben-Nun, Judah Maccabee and Bar Kochba – heroes of the Jewish people – as well as famous victories in the Six Days War and Yom Kippur War, as well as the famous refrain, ""never again, never again.""
He reiterated the warnings about how Hamas operates – using civilians as human shieldsand hiding beneath hospitals to carry out their operations while manipulating international law for protection. He claimed that Israel’s allies in the ""Western world and … the Arab world, understand today that if Israel does not win, they will be next in line in the campaign of conquest and murder of the axis of evil.

""In an Op-Ed published Saturday in The New York Times, former U.S. envoy to the Middle East Dennis Ross claimed that he had spoken with allies across the Middle East during the past two weeks and found that Arab officials understood ""that Hamas must be destroyed in Gaza,"" since any perceived victory for the terrorists ""will validate the group’s ideology of rejection, give leverage and momentum to Iran and its collaborators and put their own governments on the defensive.""
Netanyahu leaned on that existential threat at the peak of his speech, stressing that the war on Hamas is a fight ""to be or to cease,"" but he insisted that Israel would succeed, saying, ""we will be and we will win"" but admitting the war would not end quickly.

Netanyahu fractures cabinet with claim that he wasn’t warned about Oct. 7 Hamas attack


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu frustrated members of his security cabinet on Sunday by claiming that he never received a warning about Hamas' Oct. 7 assault that led to the ongoing war in Gaza.
Netanyahu posted the claim from his official account on X, formerly known as Twitter, though it was deleted soon afterward Sunday morning. Each of his cabinet members who hold responsibilities related to national security have acknowledged their failings in relation to October 7, but Netanyahu has angered some by admitting no wrongdoing.

""At no time and no stage was a warning given to Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding war intentions of Hamas. On the contrary, all security officials, including the head of army intelligence and the head of the Shin Bet, estimated that Hamas was deterred and interested in an arrangement,"" Netanyahu's post read.
The prime minister later amended his statement and apologized.
""I was wrong,"" saying his statement ""should not have been made and I apologize for that.""
""I give full backing to all the heads of the security branches,"" he added.

Jewish students at Georgetown Law fear violence amid heated rhetoric from classmates and anti-Israeli groups,2023-10-21,Fox News,['Kerry J. Byrne'],"FOX News' Lawrence Jones speaks with pro-Palestinian students at Georgetown University about Hamas' terror attack in Israel on 'FOX & Friends.'
Some Jewish students at Georgetown Law School say they're facing threatening anti-Israeli rhetoric from classmates and from outside groups that are being promoted on the Washington, D.C. campus. The hostile rhetoric includes what appears to be a globally orchestrated antisemitic campaign that the students fear will incite physical violence on campus as war escalates between Israelis and Palestinians. 
""Knowing you're sitting in class next to someone who advocates the destruction of Israel is frightening,"" Julia Wax, a first-year Georgetown Law student from San Diego, California, told Fox News Digital.
UKRAINIAN ORPHANS WHO ESCAPED TO ISRAEL WERE FORCED TO EVACUATE ONCE AGAIN: ‘BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN’
She and other law school students recently formed the Georgetown Law Zionists as a show of resolve in response to the threats. 
""Because it's law school, people here are nuanced with their hate,"" Wax said.

The group is concerned that administrators have failed to publicly condemn violent, antisemitic and anti-Zionist language that is being shared by other students or shouted at events and protests promoted on campus.
Last weekend at Franklin Park, about a mile from campus, protesters chanted, ""We don’t want no Jewish state. We want '48.""
The demonstration was promoted by law school students and attended by classmates, too, the Georgetown Law Zionists claim.
""Because it's law school, people here are nuanced with their hate."" — Julia Wax, Georgetown Law student
""When we hear that, we hear that they want the extermination of Jews,"" said Wax. ""They don't want peace in Israel at all. They want to eliminate or displace 6 million Jewish people.""
The expression ""we want ‘48"" refers to the Middle East’s status before the nation of Israel was created by the United Nations in 1948, in the aftermath of the Holocaust.

Georgetown Law Zionists say the phrase ""by any means necessary"" is a direct threat of violence.
The post continued, ""You cannot claim to stand with Palestine if you’d prefer us to be slaughtered without fighting back.""
The statement was first posted to Instagram by New York City attorney Nerdeen Kiswani (@nerdeenk), who made headlines when she issued an anti-Israeli screed in a commencement address at CUNY Law School in 2022.

""We had peace before Israel was created,"" Kiswani said in another speech in 2021. ""So abolishing Israel is the key to peace.""
Michael Korvyakov, a freshman at Georgetown University, told ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Lawrence Jones recently, ""The biggest problem has really been the fact that student organizations have cropped up on campus that are largely spewing this antisemitic rhetoric.""

Byrne/Fox News Digital)
""In addition to that, multiple organizations released statements basically calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and also calling for anti-Israeli sentiment.""
The anti-Israeli protests, volatile language and social media blitz appear to be a well-coordinated international effort with tentacles at major universities around the United States.
""If you support Palestine, understand that necessitates supporting our right to defend ourselves and liberate our homeland by any means necessary."" — Georgetown Law student on Instagram
The members of Georgetown Law Zionists believe that the language is often loaded with racist or historically, geopolitically and ethnically controversial references meant to incite rage against Jews and Israelis.

""As the Palestinian student movement, we have an unshakable responsibility to join the call for mass mobilization,"" reads part of the statement, which was widely circulated among students at Georgetown Law and at other colleges and universities across the country. 
""National liberation is near — glory to our resistance, to our martyrs, and to our steadfast people.""

Georgetown Law first-year student Arielle Vertsman of Fort Lee, New Jersey, told Fox News Digital, ""Openly vocalizing support for martyrs is equivalent to condoning terrorism."" 
She added, ""To support martyrs is to support the deaths of Jews, not in the name of resistance, but in the name of annihilating our people.""
The ""toolkit"" refers several times to the United States and Canada as ""occupied Turtle Island,"" a radical leftist term meant to declare that the two nations are illegitimate because North America was taken from indigenous peoples.

""Apartheid, ethnic cleansing, indiscriminate bombing, arbitrary detention, destruction of infrastructure, 75 years of settler colonialism are provocations,"" The National Students for Justice in Palestine claim in the document.
The group also quotes Malcolm X: ""You don't get freedom peacefully … Anyone who is depriving you of freedom isn't deserving of a peaceful approach.""
JEWISH COLLEGE STUDENTS SAY THEY'RE SCARED TO GO TO CLASS, BLAME UNIVERSITIES FOR SILENCE ON ANTISEMITISM
Georgetown Law School dean Mitch Bailin recently met with Jewish students to hear their concerns. 
But Georgetown Law Zionists members told Fox News Digital that they emerged from the meeting dissatisfied with the school's response or lack of condemnation of threats to them circulating on campus. 
Georgetown University earlier issued this statement, as Fox News Digital previously reported: ""Our long-standing commitment to interreligious understanding enables us to draw upon our faith traditions — all shaped by the pursuit of peace. We each have to discern how we can best contribute to peace and reconciliation. In our sacred spaces—in our Makom, in our Masjid, in our chapels and religious spaces — we can bring the power of prayer to our engagement and our discernment,"" the statement from President John DeGioia read in part.

""As a university, we have a responsibility, in this moment, to contribute to understanding, and to build pathways to peace and reconciliation,"" he also said. 
""We have a responsibility to one another — to provide consolation and support to those who are suffering. May we be equal to the demands of these responsibilities.""

Women's groups face outrage for silence on Hamas crimes: 'It's time for people to say this is wrong',2023-12-05,Fox News,['Madeline Coggins'],"Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., reacts to Rep. Pramila Jayapal's response to a growing concern over atrocities committed by Hamas against women and previews a hearing with FBI Director Chris Wray.
Several top women's organizations have been largely silent on Hamas' crimes against women, and many have yet to speak up after Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was accused of downplaying Hamas terrorists’ sexual violence against Israeli women. On ""The Faulkner Focus"" Tuesday, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., called out Jayapal and the women's groups, including Planned Parenthood and Women's March, for refusing to speak out against war crimes.JAYAPAL LIT UP BY WOMEN'S GROUPS FOR ‘REVOLTING' REMARKS ON HAMAS RAPES: ’IT IS CHILLING'
SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN: It is disgusting and the fact that you have Congresswoman Jayapal who will try to draw a moral equivalence when asked about these sexual atrocities that have been committed against Israeli women. She should be listening to members of her party like Senator Gillibrand, who understands that this is a crime. These are war crimes. What is happening to these women is a crime. What Hamas is doing is barbaric. It is indecent. And what we know, if you want to make certain that the Palestinian people, the women are protected, you got to get rid of Hamas. Same goes if you want to protect Israeli women and children. Get rid of Hamas. These terrorist organizations are barbaric, act like animals, and there is no human decency that they are exercising.
…
Don't they believe what they are seeing in photographs and members of Congress have seen this footage and the reports that we are hearing. Women are being raped to the point of death. They are using sexual violence against women as a tool of war. And, of course, the IDF is gathering all of this evidence of how women have been repeatedly raped, how their bodies are bruised, how they are bloody, and the fact that this continues to go out. We still have the U.N. and people on the left and the silence of so many of these women's organizations. You know, it is time for people to say this is wrong. This is a crime. It is a war crime. And this is why we need to make certain that Israel can do away with Hamas.
Jayapal, the Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, outraged many when she was asked about atrocities committed by Hamas against Israeli women on CNN over the weekend. 
""It’s horrific, and I think that rape is horrific and sexual assault is horrific. I think that it happens in war situation, terrorist organizations like Hamas, obviously, are using these as tools. However, we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians,"" Jayapal said. 
CNN’s Dana Bash pointed out that Israeli soldiers aren’t raping Palestinians, to which the Democratic lawmaker fired back, ""I don’t want this to be the hierarchy of oppressions."" 
Jayapal also insisted ""we cannot say that one war crime deserves another"" and accused Israel of failing to comply with international humanitarian law.

Women's organizations including the Independent Women's Forum, Feminists for Life of America and Concerned Women for America rebuked Jayapal for her comments.
Many other women’s groups have remained stone silent. Fox News Digital reached out to over 20 other prominent women’s organizations that did not respond.

Israel fires 400 airstrikes into Gaza as IDF identifies terrorists said to be responsible for Oct 7 attack,2023-10-24,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest from southern Israel. 
Israel has escalated its airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, launching 400 airstrikes over the past day, its military said Tuesday. The heavy bombardment comes ahead of an expected ground invasion as Israel has waged a war against Hamas, which governs Gaza.
On Tuesday, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said the 400 airstrikes struck command centers and a Hamas tunnel shaft, killing Hamas commanders and additional Hamas troops as they were preparing to launch rockets into Israel. The previous day, Israel said it conducted 320 strikes that hit targets across Gaza.
Also on Tuesday, the IDF revealed a list of names of Hamas’ leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif, Saleh al-Arouri, Ismail Haniyeh and others.
They ""have the blood of thousands on their hands,"" the IDF wrote on X.

Why Jewish students belong at anti-Israel Ivy League schools,2023-12-06,Fox News,['Eli Federman'],"Lest People Forget Project founder Elizabeth Pipko reacts on 'Jesse Watters Primetime' to pro-Palestinian protests, commentary in the United States.

Amid rising anti-Israel sentiment at Ivy League universities like Harvard and Yale, some Jewish parents are pledging not to send their children there, and commentators like Bill Maher and Ben Shapiro are encouraging it.  This is misguided. The economic considerations of investing in an Ivy League education are valid, as families must weigh the financial burden against potential long-term benefits. 
However, boycotting these institutions is counterproductive. If we remove Jewish voices, we will only intensify the one-sided narrative on Israel and Jewish issues. Instead of alleviating the problem, this approach amplifies the echo chamber.
 An Israel flag flies during the March for Israel on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 14, 2023. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)
These Ivy League schools, despite their anti-Israel biases, are influential hubs shaping the minds of tomorrow’s leaders. Pro-Israel voices are already underrepresented. So it’s imperative that students attend these universities to offer counter-narratives and personal perspectives that challenge prevailing biases.
YAD VASHEM CHAIRMAN SLAMS IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS FOR RAMPANT ANTISEMITISM ON CAMPUSES
While genuine concerns about the safety of Jewish students exist, they often stem from isolated incidents and also exist at non Ivy League colleges too. Universities are actively addressing these through enhanced security measures and policies that promote a safe environment.  
Besides, fear should not prevent Jewish students from attending these colleges or expressing their views. Netanel Crispe, an Orthodox Jewish student at Yale, for example, confidently wore an Israel flag to a pro-Palestinian rally and repeatedly chanted, ""Am Yisrael Chai"" (""The People of Israel Live""). He didn’t seem to worry about his safety in openly displaying his identity.
The decision of donors to withdraw funding is entirely sensible. It serves as a method to pressure the university to alter its stance. No one should support an endowment at a university that is antithetical to his or her values.
But choosing not to attend these universities will not impact their admission revenue, as they consistently receive far more applications than they can accept. Regardless of some students’ decisions not to attend, these institutions will maintain their admission revenue by admitting a set number of students each year.
US DEPT OF EDUCATION OPENS INVESTIGATION OF HARVARD OVER ANTISEMITISM ON CAMPUS
Jewish students in these universities are crucial for challenging misinformation and bias against Israel. They can spearhead or join pro-Israel groups, foster constructive dialogue with peers and faculty, and advocate for more nuanced views within the Israeli-Palestinian discourse.
Historically, Jewish tradition thrives on debate and knowledge. Engaging with opposing views often leads to deeper understanding and stronger advocacy. This tradition of dialectics is what the Talmud represents. By being part of these academic institutions, Jewish students can continue this tradition, contributing significantly to campus discourse.
Boycotting Ivy League schools will not lead to a change in their stance toward Israel. Positive change is more likely through engagement and representation. Students and faculty are better off working within these systems to advocate for balanced perspectives.
ANTISEMITISM HAS BILLIONAIRES BAILING ON IVY LEAGUE DONATIONS
The presence of Jewish students at these universities is the most potent statement against antisemitism and anti-Israel bias, demonstrating resilience and commitment to defending their beliefs. It also provides essential support to other Jewish students who might feel isolated in these settings.
By encouraging Jewish students to attend these institutions, we’re investing in future leaders. Their experiences at these universities will shape their perspectives and equip them to advocate effectively for Israel and Jewish causes in their professional lives.
In fact, Ivy League schools have been the alma mater of countless influential pro-Israel voices like Ron Dermer, a University of Pennsylvania alumnus who served as Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., strengthening diplomatic ties. Dara Horn, a Harvard graduate, who integrates Jewish themes into her novels. Jared Kushner, also from Harvard, who played a pivotal role in the Abraham Accords. Dan Senor, from Harvard Business School, who co-authored ""Start-Up Nation,"" spotlighting Israel’s technological advancements. 
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The list can go on forever. Their paths illustrate the impact that can be made by those who study at these institutions.
Fears about students being swayed by anti-Israel biases underestimate their ability to think critically and stand firm in their beliefs. The prevailing views on campuses often reflect transient trends in bandwagon activism rather than deeply entrenched nuanced ideologies. Such a climate provides an opportunity for Jewish students to develop a robust understanding of opposing viewpoints and to articulate their perspectives with better clarity and conviction.

The development comes as the militant group Hezbollah took responsibility for targeting Israeli military posts with small-arms fire along the country's border with Lebanon, which the Israelis responded to with artillery strikes. 
More than 1,300 Israelis were killed and thousands more wounded when Hamas launched a surprise terror attack on the Jewish state Saturday. As many as 150 people are believed to have been taken captive by terrorists and held in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday claimed Hamas has disrupted the departure of foreign nationals from the Gaza Strip, adding that Egypt is prepared to help with getting people out and aid into the area.
Blinken was interviewed by Randa Abul Azm of Al-Arabiya on Sunday, who asked the secretary about efforts to get civilians out of harm’s way in Gaza, as Israel stages a ground offensive.
Azm prefaced a question to Blinken about getting humanitarian aid into Gaza and evacuating foreign nationals by saying, ""The efforts to evacuate foreign nationals from Gaza Strip has been blocked by Israelis.""

""And the fact of the matter is this: What does Hamas do? Hamas makes sure that all of its critical leaders, that its command centers, that its weapons, its ammunitions are all located in residential areas, in residential buildings or buried underneath hospitals, schools, and supermarkets,"" Blinken said.

The U.S. has reiterated that Hamas is responsible for the current atrocities and do not reflect the Palestinian people, who must be protected. 
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi called for access through Rafah in a speech Thursday, but he also warned against letting in large numbers of Palestinians.
""The threat there is significant because it means the liquidation of this (Palestinian) cause,"" el-Sissi said at a military college graduation ceremony in Cairo. ""It’s important for its people to stay steadfast and exist on its land.""
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry later called the evacuation order a ""grave violation"" of international law.

Egyptian officials have long feared that Israel seeks to make their country responsible for Palestinians in Gaza, which Egypt ruled between the 1948 and 1967 Mideast wars. Egypt has joined Israel in its blockade of the Gaza Strip since the Hamas takeover, tightly controlling entry of supplies and the exit of people.

Some women's group silent as top progressive Jayapal downplays rapes by Hamas ,2023-12-05,Fox News,['Brian Flood'],"The Five co-hosts discuss Squad member Pramila Jayapal downplaying Hamas brutality against women on Oct. 7 and women’s groups remaining silent about rape allegations against Israelis.
Some prominent women’s organizations say ""rape and mutilation must be universally condemned without equivocation,"" but many other women’s groups have yet to speak up after a Democratic lawmaker was accused of downplaying Hamas terrorists’ sexual violence against Israeli women. 
Credible accounts of rape and brutal sexual assault were immediately reported in the wake of Hamas’ terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7. However, Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., outraged many when she was asked about the atrocities on CNN over the weekend. 
""It’s horrific, and I think that rape is horrific and sexual assault is horrific. I think that it happens in war situation, terrorist organizations like Hamas, obviously, are using these as tools. However, we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians,"" Jayapal said. 
JAYAPAL'S CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS ON HAMAS RAPE HIT BY FELLOW DEMOCRAT: 'INDECENT TO DOWNPLAY' ATROCITIES
Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal clashed with CNN host Dana Bash on Sunday over a lack of condemnation of Hamas' use of sexual violence during their attacks on Israeli women.  (Screenshot/CNN/StateOfTheUnion)
CNN’s Dana Bash pointed out that Israeli soldiers aren’t raping Palestinians, to which the Democratic lawmaker fired back, ""I don’t want this to be the hierarchy of oppressions."" 
Jayapal also insisted ""we cannot say that one war crime deserves another"" and accused Israel of failing to comply with international humanitarian law.
Independent Women's Forum president Carrie Lukas blasted Jayapal on behalf of the organization. 
""Women’s bodies are not battlefields. Rape and mutilation must be universally condemned without equivocation, especially from a woman sitting in the U.S. House of Representatives. Those who orchestrated and carried out the mass rapes in Israel on October 7 should be brought to justice for war crimes. It is time to take action. This is not a partisan issue. It is not a political issue. It is a matter of respecting universal human rights. The violence and degradation we saw on October 7 is simply inexcusable,"" Lukas told Fox News Digital. 
""It’s revolting to see a sitting Member of Congress, a woman no less, who can’t even simply condemn the mass rape of women. This isn’t hard. Or it isn’t unless you're really concerned about not offending those who support the terrorists,"" Lukas continued. ""She has no regard for the rights of Israeli women, and her victim blaming of Israel in recent days is shameful. Jayapal has made it clear that women’s rights are not universal human rights, they are to be afforded only to those women who see the world in the sick, twisted way she does. It is chilling to think about what nonsense the U.S. House Progressive Caucus will put forward next.""

(Israel Defense Forces via AP)
Feminists for Life of America told Fox News Digital that ""rape is rape"" and it ""does not matter the circumstances or the perpetrator, rape is never justified."" 
Concerned Women for America CEO and president Penny Nance also scolded Jayapal.
""Rep. Jayapal’s comments are reprehensible and her hatred of Jews clearly evident,"" Nance told Fox News Digital. 
""I was recently invited to watch the video of the horrific actions of the Hamas terrorists on October 7 and there is no description for the evil that was perpetrated on innocent women and children. The footage collected from GoPro body cams showed the despicable desecration of young women’s bodies and we have the testimony of women seeing their friends gang raped and literally murdered during the act. We have coroners’ reports,"" Nance added. ""How dare these ‘Squad’ members and phony women’s activists at the U.N. and Congress claim to protect women’s rights.""
Nance added that ""abuse of women in war is a declared human rights violation,"" and doesn’t believe Jewish women are being respected. 
""What happened to ‘believe all women?’ Apparently, it doesn’t apply to Jews,"" Nance said. ""The Squad and other terrorist sycophants are so invested in their sick ideology and hatred of Israel and the Jews that they have no credibility with anyone, especially women.""
UN Women told Fox News Digital on Tuesday it condemned the ""abhorrent attacks"" by Hamas while not mentioning Jayapal's remarks specifically.
""Our thoughts and solidarity are with the survivors and families of victims,"" a spokesperson said. ""Within days of the horrific attacks, UN Women began offering concrete support to the UN Commission of Inquiry which is investigating these matters. We believe a full investigation is essential, so that perpetrators at all sides can be held accountable and justice can be served. Some weeks ago, UN Women met with Israeli women’s organizations to hear about their work to carry out investigation of this painful situation, and offered them our support. We appreciate the difficulty of such work and the toll it takes on those undertaking it, and they have our appreciation and respect.
""We recognize that UN procedures can appear to be slow-moving. This is particularly true for public statements on conflict-related sexual violence, which require thorough investigation by the Commission of Inquiry (COI). This approach has been a standard practice in handling most past conflicts as well. We welcome that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten has activated the UN Action network to proactively share UN-sourced and verified information on incidents, patterns, and trends of conflict-related sexual violence to aid all investigations.""
Many other women’s groups have remained silent. Fox News Digital reached out to over 20 other prominent women’s organizations that did not respond. 
""The Five"" co-hosts expressed shock at the silence from women’s groups on Monday, focusing on Planned Parenthood, Women’s March, Democrat Women’s Caucus, Emily’s List and National Organization for Women.
""They marched in lockstep in their condemnation of all sorts of people in the Me Too movement, right? ‘Believe all women,’ these are the same groups, though, who, if you go back to the late 1990s, they all walked away from defending Monica Lewinsky. They all will turn a blind eye to something if they think it will help their political position or will protect them from condemnation from somebody like Jayapal,"" Fox News host Dana Perino said.

Judge Jeanine Pirro was stunned that some of the groups didn’t even bother to respond. 
""I am shocked, because for the longest time… I was part of that original movement which was fighting for rape victims, making sure that rape victims didn’t have to take a lie detector test, making sure that a defense attorney could not say to the jury that, ‘Well, she was dressed that way, she deserved it,’ I mean, I was there in the beginning,"" Pirro said. 
""But then, all of the sudden about 10 years ago, we had this Me Too movement, so they just discovered the abuse and the suppression of women,"" she continued. ""This new progressive, so-called progressive group, is really a regressive one. They are taking back the decades of progress that we’ve made.""

Biden offers apology to Muslim-American leaders for questioning Hamas death toll,2023-11-26,Fox News,['Stepheny Price'],"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on lawmakers' sparring over Israel and Ukraine funding and Pentagon funding requests for DEI initiatives.
President Biden reportedly issued an apology to several prominent Muslim-American leaders after openly questioning the accuracy of the death toll figures from Gaza. 
During a press conference on Oct. 25, President Biden openly questioned the number of casualties Gaza, which are reported by the Hamas government.
""I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,"" Biden said. ""I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s a price of waging war.""
Biden met with five Muslim American leaders the day after his Oct. 25 comments about reported Gaza deaths.

During the meeting, Biden listened to the leaders describe people they knew who were directly impacted by the conflict in the Middle East. 
""I’m sorry. I’m disappointed in myself,"" Biden told the group, according to the Washington Post. 
The Muslim-American leaders who met with Biden urged him to show more empathy to the Palestinians and Biden allegedly hugged one of the participants at the end of the meeting.

According to data from the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, more than 14,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including many women and children, have been killed in the weeks-old war. 
Israel has suffered more than 1,200 fatalities, most of those being civilians, who were killed when the Hamas terror group fired a sneak attack on Israel on October 7, according to officials.
Not only has Biden faced criticism and pressure from his own administration on the strategy taken in Gaza, some prominent Democrats have also publicly disagreed with the president’s response to the war.

Biden has endorsed U.S. support for Israel following the Oct. 7 attack, but he also has pushed for a pause in the fighting to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and for hostages held by Hamas to get released.
""For weeks, I’ve been advocating to pause the fighting for two purposes: to increase the assistance getting into the Gaza civilians who need help and to facilitate release of hostages,"" Biden said on Sunday. ""We know that innocent children in Gaza are suffering greatly as well.""

Sullivan: Israel should protect Gaza civilians despite Hamas making ‘life difficult’ with human shields,2023-10-29,Fox News,['Stephen Sorace'],"FOX News correspondent Steve Harrigan joins FOX News Live with the latest details on the Israel-Hamas war.
Israel should take responsibility for protecting innocent civilians in Gaza even though Hamas is using them as human shields, Biden administration national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday, as Israeli forces continue to bombard the Gaza Strip following the deadly terrorist attack more than three weeks ago.
Sullivan appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" saying the Israeli government should take every possible action to distinguish terrorists from civilians during its ongoing operations.
""Hamas is making life extremely difficult for Israel by taking civilians as human shields and putting their rocket infrastructure and terrorist infrastructure among civilians,"" Sullivan said. ""That creates an added burden for Israel, but it does not lessen Israel’s responsibility under international humanitarian law to distinguish between terrorist and civilians and protect lives of innocent people.""
Sullivan added: ""And that is the overwhelming majority of the people in Gaza.""

While Sullivan said President Biden will speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later Sunday about protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he added that the U.S. has already been holding conversations behind closed doors about protecting civilians.
""We have had conversations privately, as well as our public pronouncements, private conversations with Israel about the need to protect innocent civilians and be targeted in their military operations so that it’s focused on the terrorists and not on innocent people whose lives deserve to be protected,"" he said.

Since Hamas terrorists first infiltrated Israel on Oct. 7, as many as 8,700 people have been killed in the war on both sides, including at least 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers and 33 Americans. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claims more than 7,300 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and 110 in the West Bank, although the Biden administration has looked at numbers coming from Hamas with a degree of skepticism.

Pro-Palestinian student groups on college campuses across the U.S. are voicing their support for Hamas terrorists' attack against Israel, claiming that the actions by the terror group are part of a ""liberation movement.""
More than 1,900 people have been killed in the war since Hamas launched its largest attack on Israel in decades on Saturday, leading to retaliatory action from Israeli forces. Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.
The statements from several dozen Students for Justice in Palestine chapters at various universities across the country come after about 30 Harvard University student groups faced widespread criticism for signing onto a statement blaming Israel for Hamas' attack. The Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups wrote, ""We, the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.""
The Students for Justice in Palestine chapters purport in their respective statements released since Saturday that Israel is not the victim and Hamas is fighting for liberation.
HARVARD STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS CLAIM ISRAEL ‘ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE’ FOR GAZA ATTACKS

""We call to attention that the Israeli occupation has created a multi-generational diaspora that is inextricably linked to the insurmountable destruction of the Palestinian way of life,"" the University of California, Berkley, chapter wrote. ""Hence, Israel, as a settler colonial state, renders Palestinian existence inherently an act of resistance. We invariably reject Israel's framing as a victim. Whereas to demonize and condemn indigenous resistance is to overshadow the decades of oppression, ethnic cleansing, and destruction of the Palestinian people.""
""We support the resistance, we support the liberation movement, and we indisputably support the Uprising,"" the group added.
The George Washington University chapter wrote, ""GWU Students for Justice in Palestine stands in full support of the liberation of our homeland and our people's right to resist the violent 75-year long colonization of our homeland by any means necessary.""
""Over the past few days, Palestinians in Gaza and across occupied Palestine have mobilized against the Zionist entity, seizing settlements imposed on our land in violation of international law,"" the statement said. ""For the first time in our history, Palestinians have reclaimed land that we were ethnically cleansed from in 1948. Over 50% of Gaza's population is under 18 years old. The vast majority of them have never been outside of the colonial prison walls, have never set foot on a single inch of the land that their families were violently ethnically cleansed from. This past weekend we witnessed them breaking free, tearing down the prison walls, and making it known to the world: WE WILL BE CAGED NO LONGER.""
The GWU chapter further alleged that the ""mobilization is NOT unprovoked,"" adding the attack on Israel is a ""response to the brutal blockade and siege on Gaza that has left over 2 million of our people languishing under starvation and terror.""

"Israeli MIT students ‘terrified’ after anti-Israel rally chant calls for ‘one solution, intifada’",2023-10-24,Fox News,['Brianna Herlihy'],"Hundreds of protesters at an anti-Israel rally held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology chant ""one solution, intifada, revolution"" in the wake of the Hamas attacks on Israel this month. (Liyam Chitayat)
Israeli students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) say they are ""terrified"" to be on campus after participants at a campus protest chanted ""one solution, intifada, revolution"" at a rally supporting the devastating Hamas terrorist attacks that killed hundreds of Israelis in Israel.
MIT students Liyam Chitayat and Lior Alon told Fox News Digital in interviews that after they contacted MIT’s administration to report the calls to violence being chanted from the protest and for concern for their own safety, they’ve yet to receive a substantial response.
Chitayat, a 19-year-old pursuing a Ph.D. on a prestigious scholarship and who previously served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), describes the rally cry as a call for the murder of Jews and the demolition of Israel.
""Intifada is not a call for resistance. Intifada is the name of acts of bombing and killing civilians in Israel in the Israel-Palestine conflict. It's the name of taking civilian lives in terrorist attacks in Israel. That is what intifada means. That is how it's defined,"" she said.
TIM SCOTT WANTS TO DEFUND COLLEGES OVER ANTI-ISRAEL STATEMENTS: 'HITS THEM WHERE IT HURTS'
Liyam Chitayat is 19-year-old Ph.D. student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (Liyam Chitayat)
Historically, what’s called as the First Intifada was a deadly series of attacks and protests carried out by Palestinians against Israelis during the 1980s. The Second Intifada occurred in the early 2000s as at least 1,000 Israelis were killed by terrorist attacks carried out by Palestinians using suicide bombers on busses and shooting civilians in the streets, bars and restaurants in cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
Chitayat, who majored in biology and chemistry in her undergraduate studies, was the recipient of a research award named after a man who was murdered during the intifada. She also lost two friends and classmates to an intifada attack a year ago.
The recent protest rally at MIT was held by several student groups, including MIT Coalition Against Apartheid. That group issued a statement the day after the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, saying they ""hold the Israeli regime responsible for all unfolding violence.""
""We unequivocally denounce the Israeli occupation, its racist apartheid system, and its military rule. Colonization is inherently violent, aimed at erasing and replacing indigenous peoples. We affirm the right of all occupied peoples to resist oppression and colonization,"" the statement reads.
""I think there are things in life where you actually have to witness them to believe they exist,"" Chitayat said. ""And [the] rally was one of those things. I just saw a group of over 100 students standing there and making the lives of people who are lost in one of the most horrifying terrorist attacks into a game of identity politics.""
""I have friends on the front lines, and I also have friends who have been in the villages where the most heinous terrorist attacks known to modern history were committed,"" Chitayat said, referencing the Oct. 7 massacre carried out by Hamas terrorists in the deadliest attack on the Jewish community since the Holocaust.
Chitayat described the initial devastation and dealing with the loss ""alone,"" away from her home country and feeling unable to help 6,000 miles away. But now, she’s angry.
""My feelings are shifting a lot more towards anger because their blood hasn't even dried yet, and our campus is allowing, promoting, funding organizations that are calling for murder of Jews actively on campus, calling for demolition of Israel. And I wish I would have known that, I’m not sure if I would have come here,"" Chitayat said.

Chitayat, who was raised in a single-parent home, said it had been her dream to attend MIT since she was 12 years old. 
""I love science and I love art. I've been sort of enamored by all the things that nature has created around us from a very young age,"" she described. Showing exceptional talent and academic capabilities, she was accepted at 12 years old into a university in Israel.
After earning admission into top universities, including Harvard, Chitayat was granted an early release from the IDF. She chose MIT, she says, because she felt it was more open-minded and wasn’t conducive to ""glorifying real world crisis into one-sentence spoken word acts.""
""Since the age of 12, my dream was to get to the exact spot that I'm standing in right now. Two months ago, when I came here, was one of the most magnificent points in my career where I really felt like I could do it as someone who comes from a background that isn't traditionally in academia, as someone who really fought hard to get here,"" she said.

But now she fears for her safety on campus after feeling ""personally targeted and persecuted"" by students who cheer for ""the death of my people, my community as the only solution.""
 ""I don't know what type of education or desensitization these 20-year-olds have been through, to think that the rape, mutilation and parading of women's innocent bodies through the streets is resistance? How decapitating babies is resistance? How taking elderly women, shooting them, broadcasting it live on their own Facebook accounts, is resistance?"" Chitayat stated, referencing some of the brutal details of the Hamas attacks.
MIT president Sally Kornbluth in an Oct. 10 statement condemned the Hamas terror attacks, saying ""[t]he brutality perpetrated on innocent civilians in Israel by terrorists from Hamas is horrifying. In my opinion, such a deliberate attack on civilians can never be justified."" 
On Oct. 21 after the anti-Israel protest, Kornbluth made a subsequent statement. ""I have communicated my staunch support for free speech repeatedly in the past, and I stand by those principles. We defend that right as the best path to knowledge and learning; a university cannot function without it,""she said.
""But I have also been abundantly clear that individual targeting, harassment, or calls to violence are unacceptable.  And some of what has been said and done on our campus alarms me. Indeed, some individuals in our community – Jews, Muslims and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians – have let us know that they feel fearful and concerned for their physical safety,"" Kornbluth continued.
""I won’t repeat the ugly words and actions community members have shared with me — dehumanizing name-calling and overt shunning of Muslim and Arab students in the dorms and laboratories; mass chanting of phrases that harken back to past antisemitic horrors or violent attacks on Israelis – as it would be adding fuel to the fire. But make no mistake: We cannot let MIT become a place where we treat each other this way,"" she added, noting that the school is ""working to ensure the safety of our community in practical ways, through coordination and added patrols."" 
Lior Alon, an Israeli post-doctoral student at MIT, said the ""intifada"" chants were an escalation from a rally simply supporting a political view of the Middle East conflict.

""This is not even related to what happens in Israel. That is calling for a terror attack here. A huge group of people calling out loud for terror attacks,"" Alon said.
Alon said he called MIT police to report the calls for violence, and they suggested that if he were ""offended"" he should file a report with the school, leaving Alon in disbelief.

""As a person that lived through two intifadas, that knows what it means for an entire country to be afraid to ride the bus or to go out to the street or to hang out in public because of terror attacks,"" Alon said.
Alon argued that maybe 99% of the students calling for terrorism are just ""stupid kids"" who don’t know the weight that the phrase carries or what it means.
""But we only need one stupid person with a gun,"" he said.
Alon, a formal naval officer for years in the Israeli military and fought several battles in Gaza, says he is ""truly afraid"" to walk on campus in light of the anti-Israel protests.
""I'm terrified,"" he said.

Alon says that he wrote to MIT President Kornbluth, who replied that she was sorry that he felt the way he did and that they were ""working on"" the issue, but so far, no additional communication has been made.

Media has egg on its face for allowing Hamas to set initial tone of Gaza hospital coverage without skepticism,2023-10-20,Fox News,['Brian Flood'],"FOX News chief political analyst Brit Hume weighs in on the medias coverage of an explosion at a Gaza hospital.
Much of the legacy media has egg on its face for allowing the Hamas-backed Gaza Health Ministry to set the initial framing when covering an explosion that occurred at a Gaza hospital earlier this week. Many news organizations that were quick to repeat Hamas’ claim that Israel was at fault have since walked it back, but watchdogs believe it was a ""terrible mistake"" with lasting consequences. 
The Israel Defense Force determined the blast was caused by a rocket misfire launched by Islamic Jihad, another terrorist organization active in Gaza. President Biden, based on evidence from the IDF and U.S. intelligence, has publicly said Israel was not to blame. But that hasn’t stopped protests around the world from people who still believe Hamas talking points that were published by major media outlets. 
Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume called it a ""media fiasco"" and scolded news organizations that echoed Hamas propaganda without skepticism.
MEDIA ACCUSED OF PARROTING HAMAS' TALKING POINTS ON GAZA HOSPITAL BLAST, IDF SPOX SAYS TERROR GROUP ‘LYING’

""Look, any story on this would properly report what the Palestinians were saying. But they would also be informed, I would think, of the fact that the Palestinian health authority or whatever the organization is called that put out this original claim that Israel was responsible, is governed by Hamas,"" Hume said Wednesday on ""Special Report.""
""So, this is what the terrorists are saying about an alleged terror attack from Israel. So… you treat it with great skepticism. That, alas, is not what happened in far too many corners of the media and western media in general. There were huge headlines, yes, they all said this is what the Palestinians were saying. But that gave you the impression that this is what some innocent Palestinians caught up in all of this were saying. That’s not the case,"" Hume continued. 
Hume pointed out that Hamas committed ""one of the most hideous atrocities that we have seen in a very long time"" on Oct. 7. 
""The idea that you would parrot propaganda from that source, as if it were legitimate… without great skepticism, seems to me is a terrible mistake,"" he said. 
The New York Post published a scathing opinion piece by Isaac Schorr headlined, ""Media parrots Hamas’ lie without question — and Jews suffer for it,"" which further condemned the press’ actions. 
""It is no exaggeration to say the media breathlessly amplified a terrorist organization’s blood libel against the Jewish people Tuesday, less than a week and a half after that same terrorist organization carried out the largest single-day slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust,"" Schorr wrote. 
""Everyone, especially the reporters responsible for Tuesday’s deluge of misinformation, knows there’s no independent health ministry operating in Gaza; every piece of information coming from official channels in Gaza is curated or fabricated by Hamas,"" he continued.
The Post opinion piece explained that ""the media should obviously not be amplifying the claims of terrorists"" and ""if the press insists on using these sources, it must not conceal them from the public.""
""Laundering Hamas’ lies with weasel words like ‘government in Gaza’ or by referring to innocuous-sounding ‘health authorities’ isn’t exonerating — it’s an even more damning indictment of those who engaged in this thinly veiled propaganda campaign,"" Schorr wrote, adding, ""This constitutes one of the most flagrant and consequential failures of the American press in decades, and the full measure of its repercussions will likely not be known for years to come.""
CBS NEWS SHAMED FOR POST ON GAZA HOSPITAL BLAST SUGGESTING ISRAEL AT FAULT: ‘DID HAMAS WRITE THIS TWEET?’
Former CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter said prominent newsrooms made an ""atrocious series of mistakes"" when covering the explosion. 
Free Beacon media reporter Drew Holden posted a comprehensive list of ""outlets who carried water for a terrorist group to smear Israel"" by rushing to parrot claims of the Hamas-backed health ministry before facts came out. The Associated Press, Reuters, The New York Times, the Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN, BBC, PBS and The Daily Beast were among the outlets called out by Holden. 
""Remember, the outlets who pushed this Hamas lie are the same ones who have spent years shouting that the greatest threat society faces is disinformation,"" Holden wrote. 
BIDEN SAYS ISRAEL NOT TO BLAME FOR GAZA HOSPITAL BLAST, CITES DATA 'SHOWN BY MY DEFENSE DEPARTMENT'
NewsBusters executive editor Tim Graham doesn’t expect culpable media organizations to explain what happened anytime soon. 
""The ‘prestige media’ that lecture everyone else about being patsies for disinformation ought to be humbler and more apologetic about how they report on ‘mass casualty’ events that have the potential to cause global unrest,"" Graham told Fox News Digital. ""No one expects CNN or AP or Reuters -- who all blamed Israel at the drop of their pens -- to put their own ‘fact checkers’ on the case and explain how wrong they were."" 
Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann initially posted on social media that President Biden ""cannot in good conscience go to Israel"" following the ""Israeli strike"" on the hospital, but eventually deleted the post and apologized. 
""Given the IDF denial on this, its insistence the explosion resulted from Hamas weapons, and in the absence of independent verification either way, I retract and delete this tweet without reservation and with my apology for concluding before conclusions should have been made,"" Olbermann wrote. 
While Olbermann apologized, others have continued to push the narrative that Israel was at fault. The ""CBS Evening News"" was roasted Wednesday night for a social media post that focused on a doctor who insisted Israel's army had previously warned the facility to evacuate. 
The quickly ridiculed CBS post accompanied a video in which a Gaza woman said they got ""bombed,"" and the CBS News reporter put an emphasis on Palestinian claims that an Israeli rocket previously struck the hospital. 
""CBS Evening News"" was roasted Wednesday night for a social media post that suggested Israel was to blame for the explosion that rocked the al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City despite President Biden and the Israeli government saying otherwise.  (Twitter/Screenshot)
IDF Spokesperson Jonathan Conricus posted a video ""debunking Hamas fake news"" that meticulously broke down what the media got wrong. 
""When there was an explosion at the hospital in Northern Gaza, reports came out and almost immediately many international media outlets were very quick to adopt the Hamas narrative, use Hamas language and claims, and immediately blame Israel,"" Conricus said.
""As time went by, reality was different from this,"" Conricus said while pointing to a screen showing headlines from prominent news organizations. ""What I will show you now is how we understood that this was a fake.""
Conricus then laid out significant evidence that indicated the explosion was actually caused by a rocket misfire launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, including multiple pieces of footage including a thermal view that failed to show the body count alleged by Hamas. The IDF spokesperson also compared the aftermath of Israeli bombs to Hamas rockets, noting that damage to the hospital parking lot mirrored the rockets and that an Israeli bomb would have done significantly more damage. 
""I find it sad that so many distinguished, respectable media institutions in the world were so fast and so trigger happy to report what Hamas was saying, and didn’t wait for confirmation,"" Conricus said.
LIVE UPDATES: ISRAEL AT WAR WITH HAMAS 
The New York Times defended its coverage to Fox News Digital. 
""During any breaking news event, we report what we know as we learn it. We apply rigor and care to what we publish, explicitly citing sources and noting when a piece of news is breaking and likely to be updated. And as the facts on the ground become more clear, we continue reporting. Our extensive and continued reporting on the hospital in Gaza makes explicit the murkiness surrounding the events there,"" a Times spokesperson said.
A Reuters spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""It is standard practice for Reuters to publish statements and claims made by sources about news in the public interest, while simultaneously working to verify and seek information from every side. We make it clear to our readers that these are ‘claims’ made by a source, rather than facts reported by Reuters. In the specific instance of the fast-breaking news about the attack on the hospital in Gaza, we added precise details and attribution to our stories as quickly as we could. 
""Reuters is committed to continuing to cover the Israel-Hamas conflict with independence, integrity and freedom from bias, in keeping with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.""
The Associated Press, Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN, BBC, PBS and The Daily Beast did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Karine Jean-Pierre refuses to call out Rep. Jayapal during ‘The View’:,2023-12-05,Fox News,['Hanna Panreck'],"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre doubled down on her refusal to condemn Rep. Jayapal's recent comments calling for ""balance"" during a discussion on Hamas' use of rape in their attacks on Israeli Women.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wouldn't directly comment Tuesday on Rep. Pramila Jayapal's call for being ""balanced"" about Hamas' use of rape as a weapon of war, telling ""The View"" that the Progressive Caucus chair could speak for herself.
""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin said Jayapal, D-Wash., seemed to downplay sexual atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7 during a recent media interview, where she called for being ""balanced"" in not forgetting ""outrages against Palestinians."" Griffin asked Jean-Pierre if the progressive congresswoman should clarify her remarks. 
""I'm going to let the representative speak for herself. I just can't speak for her. I speak for the President of the United States. I am the White House press secretary obviously, so that’s who I speak for,"" she responded.
""When it comes to rape, that’s reprehensible. When it comes to using rape as a weapon of war, that’s reprehensible, we are very clear about denouncing Hamas’ actions and that’s what the president has been clear about, and as an administration more broadly, we're going to continue to be very clear about,"" Jean-Pierre added.

JAYAPAL'S CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS ON HAMAS RAPE HIT BY FELLOW DEMOCRAT: 'INDECENT TO DOWNPLAY' ATROCITIES
After claiming Sunday she had spoken out against Hamas' rape of Israeli women, Jayapal quickly turned a conversation with CNN's Dana Bash back to Israel and argued that ""we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians. Fifteen thousand Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air strikes, three-quarters of whom are women and children."" 
Griffin asked Jean-Pierre again about whether she thought Jayapal should clarify her response because of ""her perch as a progressive leader.""
""I speak for the president, she has to speak for herself,"" Jean-Pierre said.
Jean-Pierre was asked about Jayapal's comment during the White House press briefing on Monday.

""I can only speak for the president — that's who I can speak for,"" Jean-Pierre told Fox News correspondent Jacqui Heinrich. ""We've been clear that what Hamas did is absolutely reprehensible, full stop. We're going to continue to be clear about that.""
Several House Democrats condemned Jayapal's remarks on Monday, including Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., and Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y.
""Hamas terrorists raped Israeli women and girls. The only ‘balanced’ approach is to condemn sexual violence loudly, forcefully and without exceptions. Outrageous for anyone to ‘both sides’ sexual violence,"" Schultz wrote on social media.

Hamas hostages drugged before release to Israel to look happy: report,2023-12-05,Fox News,"['Greg Norman', 'Chris Pandolfo']","Dr. Renana Eitan joins 'Sunday Night in America' to discuss what she has learned from treating freed hostages at the Tel Aviv Medical Center.
The hostages who have been freed by Hamas from the Gaza Strip were given tranquilizer pills before being transferred to Israel in a bid to make them appear happier following their treatment in captivity, a report says. 
Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, the head of the Israeli Ministry of Health’s medical division, told the Israeli government about the alleged druggings on Tuesday, according to The Times of Israel. 
The newspaper reports that Mizrahi named the drug clonazepam, which is known outside of Israel as Klonopin and Rivotril. It would have made the hostages appear calm, happy and upbeat after suffering physical abuse, deprivation and psychological terror at the hands of the Palestinian terrorist group, the report said. 
The National Institutes of Health describes clonazepam as being ""used to relieve panic attacks,"" among other purposes.

The hostages, who spent more than 50 days in captivity, were first handed over to the International Red Cross before being transferred to Israel. 
More than 240 people, Israelis and foreign nationals, were abducted to Gaza on Oct. 7 by Hamas terrorists who overran the border and massacred 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government. 
Israel has responded with a fierce bombing campaign and ground operations in a military mission to wipe out the terrorist group.

Israel and Hamas reached a temporary cease-fire agreement that took effect on Nov. 24, during which 110 hostages were freed by the terrorist group in exchange for some 240 Palestinian prisoners. The truce ended and fighting resumed on Nov. 30 after both sides accused the other of violating its terms. 
A doctor who treated freed Hamas hostages in Israel told Fox News survivors are suffering from an unprecedented level of ""extremely severe psychological abuse."" 
""I can tell you that on behalf of all the medical and psychological teams treating those who return, the mental states we encountered have no precedent in medical literature. We feel that we have to rewrite the textbooks of post-trauma,"" Dr. Renana Eitan said on ""Sunday Night in America.""

Eitan revealed the Tel Aviv Medical Center is actively treating more than 15 former hostages and described their ""severe physical and mental abuse."" He claimed they were subject to ""starvation, beating and sexual abuse"" while being held in ""inhumane sanitary conditions"" by the terror group. 
""Children were forced to watch brutal videos. They were under constant threats by weapons and threats to harm them even after they were released. They refer to the forced use of psychiatric drugs and other substances,"" Eitan said.

"Israel’s military could enter Gaza City, the capital of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, this week: Israeli media",2023-11-06,Fox News,['Lawrence Richard'],"The IDF releases video of its ground activity in the Gaza Strip amid its war against Hamas. (via IDF)
Israel’s military has surrounded Gaza City, the capital of the Gaza Strip, and has divided the northern and southern parts of the territory, marking a ""significant stage"" in its war with Hamas, military officials said.
According to Israeli media, troops are expected to begin marching through the streets of the capital as early as Monday or Tuesday, where they are expected to face Hamas operatives who are willing to fight street by street through their vast network of tunnels.
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said Monday morning aircraft struck 450 targets overnight, including tunnels, military compounds, and anti-tank missile launch posts. Troops also reportedly took over a Hamas compound early Monday morning and killed a senior Hamas militant.
Since the ground offensive in Gaza began over a week ago, 30 IDF troops have been killed, which is in addition to the more than 1,400 people killed in Israel – most of them in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that started the fighting. As of Monday morning, there have also been at least 242 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza.

Communications in Gaza went down late Sunday for several hours, according to the internet access advocacy group NetBlocks.org and the Palestinian telecom company Paltel. The companies said cell phone and internet services were restored on Monday.
The situation remains dire in the north as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remain in Gaza City and other northern towns.

Food, medicine, water and fuel, which is needed for generators that power hospitals, are all running low and Gaza’s sole power station remains shut down. Schools-turned-shelters that are run by the United Nations are beyond capacity, with many sleeping on the streets.

Over 450 trucks carrying food, water, medicine and other basic aid have been allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt since Oct. 21, but this has been insufficient to meet mounting needs of the territory’s some 2.3 million Palestinians.
Israel continues to urge Gazans to leave their homes and head south, away from the ground invasion. Some 800,000 people have heeded Israeli military orders to flee to southern Gaza.

Whoopi Goldberg defends women’s groups after co-host calls out their silence on Hamas brutality,2023-11-27,Fox News,['Hanna Panreck'],"""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg defended the silence from women's groups on the sexually violent war crimes committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 during the ABC show on Monday.
""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg defended silence from women's groups since the Israel-Hamas war began after co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin demanded more groups speak up and condemn Hamas' brutal sexual violence. 
""I am still devastated — we’re two months since this war has been underway — by silence from women’s groups in this country about rape being used as an act of war in this attack,"" Griffin said.
Griffin cited a recent video posted by Sheryl Sandberg, who wrote an op-ed for CNN that called the ""silence"" on Hamas' sexual violence ""deafening.""
""The fact that sexual violence was used against Israeli women, and the major women’s groups in this country have not come out and denounced it. This weekend, Sheryl Sandberg put out a gripping video calling for it. That violates every rule of warfare. It is the height of immorality and the fact that the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Women Empowerment has been silent, the U.N. Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women has been silent, and the international MeToo movement has been silent,"" Griffin said.

ISRAELI POLICE SAY EXTREME SEXUAL VIOLENCE, RAPE BY HAMAS TERRORISTS WAS ‘SYSTEMATIC’
Goldberg chimed in and suggested that the groups have been silent because they don't want to exacerbate the problem.
""Perhaps the reason they’ve been silent is for the same reason that you just described,"" she said. ""Well, they don’t want to exacerbate it.""
""Listen, I know that this is really hard for people to sit still with. So, right now, we’re glad people are coming out, and that’s what we’re going to keep talking about because we want to encourage — you know, the bottom line truly is this: You don’t have a choice, you have to end this because at some point, it’s going to dawn on everybody there that no one’s leaving. No one’s leaving the land so the question has to become, how do we live together on this land? That is all that people should be thinking about so that this does not continue to happen,"" she continued. 
Sandberg wrote in her op-ed published on Nov. 20 that several witnesses have described the actions of Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. ""An eyewitness has recounted the horror of watching a fellow concert-goer being gang-raped, then murdered,"" she wrote.

""We have come so far in believing survivors of rape and assault in so many situations, yet this time, many are ignoring the stories that these bodies tell us about how these women spent the last moments of their lives,"" she continued. 
Sandberg argued that the silence on these crimes was a major step backward for women.
""We must denounce these rapes in every conversation, at every rally, and on signs held on every street corner. We must forget our conflicting politics and remember our common humanity,"" she wrote.

Griffin has also called out Squad Democrats for claiming Israel was responsibile for an explosion at a hospital in Gaza.
""I want to say shame on Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar because they played a role in the fact that this agreement, with the Arab nations that he [President Biden] was going to meet with fell apart. We now know that this hospital attack that took place, Biden said he is very confident it was not the Israelis that did it. It was likely Islamic Jihad and that's because of U.S. Department of Defense intelligence and footage analyzed,"" Griffin said.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y, and other elected Democrats have moved to distance themselves from events that took place at a pro-Palestinian rally promoted by the NYC chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).
On Sunday, a protest in New York organized by the DSA – a group that boasts six members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including members of ""the Squad"" – took place in Times Square and then advanced down 42nd Street to Bryant Park, close to the Israeli Consulate.
The DSA laid the blame for the attack at Israel’s feet, posting on social media: ""Today’s events are a direct result of Israel’s apartheid regime – a regime that receives billions in funding from the United States.""
Demonstrators at the rally also burned and stomped on an Israeli flag and taunted Israel supporters with an image of a swastika. Others exhibited signs that read, ""Palestinian return by any means necessary,"" ""Israeli apartheid & genocide funded by the U.S."" and ""End all U.S. aid to Israel!""

In her first take on the rally, Ocasio-Cortez, a member of DSA, told Politico, ""It should not be hard to shut down hatred and antisemitism where we see it. That is a core tenet of solidarity.""
""The bigotry and callousness expressed in Times Square on Sunday were unacceptable and harmful in this devastating moment. It also did not speak for the thousands of New Yorkers who are capable of rejecting both Hamas’ horrifying attacks against innocent civilians as well as the grave injustices and violence Palestinians face under occupation,"" she added.
New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani, who was elected with support from DSA and delivered a keynote address at the group's national convention in August, also spoke out against the ""rhetoric at the rally.""

""My support for Palestinian liberation should never be confused for a celebration of the loss of civilian life,"" Mamdani told the outlet. ""I condemn the killing of civilians and rhetoric at a rally [on Sunday] seeking to make light of such deaths.""
Prior to the rally, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned the planned gathering as ""abhorrent and morally repugnant.""
""The people of Israel are facing violent terrorist attacks and civilian kidnappings. I condemn plans to rally in Times Square tomorrow in support of the perpetrators of these horrific actions. The planned rally is abhorrent and morally repugnant,"" Hochul wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

""It's those kids who are spewing antisemitic hate that have no idea if they stepped foot in an Islamic country, these people who want us to call them 'they/them' or whatever they want us to call them, which I have respectfully really made a point of doing.

""As someone who plays a lesbian journalist on ‘The Morning Show,’ I'm more offended by it as a lesbian than I am as a Jew, to be honest with you, because I want to say to them, ‘You f---ing idiots,'"" she said. ""'You don't exist. Like you're even lower than the Jews. A. you're Black and B. you're gay! And you're turning your back against the people who support you? Because Jews, they rally around everybody.'""

Margulies, who is Jewish, expressed her dismay at the lack of support there has been for Jews in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks.
""I'm the first person to march in Black Lives Matter. When that happened to George Floyd, I put a black screen on my Instagram- like I ran to support my Black brothers and sisters,"" she said. ""When LGBTQ people are being attacked, I run. I made a commercial for same-sex marriage with my husband in 2012. Like I am the first person to jump up when something is wrong as I think most Jews are because we have been persecuted from the beginning of time. Not just in World War II but literally from the beginning of time when we first lived in Israel, way before anybody else.""

CAIR slams Biden remarks on Palestinian civilian deaths: ‘Shocking and dehumanizing’,2023-10-26,Fox News,['Chris Pandolfo'],"President Biden answers a reporter's question about the accuracy of the death toll numbers released by the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. 
A U.S.-based pro-Muslim group blasted President Biden after he expressed ""no confidence"" in the Palestinian death toll figures reported by Hamas. 
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned what they called ""shocking and dehumanizing"" remarks made by Biden during a press conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday. 
At the White House, Biden rejected a question posed by PBS correspondent Laura Barrón-López about the Palestinian death count provided by the terrorist group Hamas, saying he has ""no confidence"" such numbers are truthful.
""We are deeply disturbed and shocked by the dehumanizing comments that President Biden made about the almost 7,000 Palestinians slaughtered by the Israeli government over the past two weeks,"" CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement.

""The Israeli government has openly admitted that it is targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. Journalists have confirmed the high number of casualties, and countless videos coming out of Gaza every day show mangled bodies of Palestinian women and children — and entire city blocks leveled to the ground. President Biden should watch some of these videos and ask himself if the crushed children being dragged out of the ruins of their family homes are a fabrication or an acceptable price of war. They are neither,"" Awad continued. 
He demanded an apology from Biden and called on the president to ""condemn the Israeli government for deliberately targeting civilians, and demand a ceasefire before more innocent people die."" 
Reached for comment, the White House noted that the president, in his answer and in his opening remarks, reiterated the importance of avoiding any Palestinian civilian casualties. Biden has repeatedly said the loss of innocent Palestinian life is a tragedy. 
During a joint press conference Wednesday alongside Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Barrón-López attempted to press Biden on whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was keeping his word of limiting civilian casualties in Israel's response to the horrific Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas.

""In the 18 days since Hamas killed 1,400 Israelis, the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed over 6,000 Palestinians, including 2,700 children,"" Barrón-López said. ""You've previously asked Netanyahu to minimize civilian casualties. Do these numbers say to you that he's ignoring that message?""
""What they say to me is I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,"" Biden responded.
Biden continued, ""I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war. I think we should be incredibly careful… Israel should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are the propagating this war against Israel. And it's against their interest when that doesn't happen. But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.""
Last week, several news organizations rushed to report claims made by the Gaza Health Ministry that Israel bombed al-Ahli Baptist Hospital through an airstrike resulting in over 500 civilian casualties. 
Subsequent reporting and intelligence found it was an explosion in the hospital's parking lot stemming from a misfired rocket fired by Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, resulting in a death toll a fraction of what Hamas had first alleged.
NORTH KOREA ACCUSES ISRAEL OF ‘GENOCIDE’ IN GAZA, LABELS US AN ‘ACCOMPLICE’
CAIR, the largest Muslim advocacy group in the nation, has faced controversy for its alleged ties to Islamic extremist groups. 
In 2009, the FBI severed its once-close ties to CAIR amid mounting evidence that the group had links to a support network for Hamas.
Local chapters of CAIR were shunned in the wake of a 15-year FBI investigation that culminated in the conviction of Hamas fundraisers at a trial in which CAIR itself was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator.
The United Arab Emirates named CAIR a terrorist organization in 2014.

In a statement on its website in May 2013, CAIR rejected suggestions it had links to terrorism.
""CAIR is not is [sic] 'the Wahhabi lobby,' a 'front group for Hamas,' a 'fundraising arm for Hezbollah,' '...part of a wider conspiracy overseen by the Muslim Brotherhood...' or any of the other false and misleading associations our detractors seek to smear us with,"" the organization said. ""That we stand accused of being both a 'fundraising arm of Hezbollah' and the 'Wahhabi lobby' is a significant point in demonstrating that our detractors are hurling slander, not fact. Hezbollah and the Salafi (Wahhabi) movement represent diametrically opposed ideologies.""

Pro-Palestinian school board member opposes honoring Hamas attack victims: ‘Ignores the root of the violence’,2023-10-13,Fox News,['Gabriel Hays'],"A pro-Palestinian Fairfax County school board member scolded fellow board members Thursday for holding a moment of silence for the victims of Hamas’ recent deadly attack against Israel.
A pro-Palestinian Fairfax County school board member scolded fellow board members Thursday for giving a statement and holding a moment of silence for the victims of Hamas’ recent deadly attack against Israel.
During the meeting, Abrar Omeish rebuked the board for their ""sneak attack"" of inserting a moment of silence for victims of Saturday's surprise terrorist attack and Israel’s ensuing war against Hamas into the meeting’s agenda. 
She also criticized members for using language in the brief commemoration that didn’t ""represent all children."" She noted she had sought a ""statement that represented everybody’s views,"" implying frustration that the statement did not speak to the Palestinian struggle in any way.
Omeish appeared to object to board member Laura Jane Cohen’s speech in honor of the victims that she gave after the Pledge of Allegiance and prior to the moment of silence and a performance of the national anthem by West Springfield high school orchestra students. 
‘DESPICABLE’: STUDENTS CONDEMN HARVARD STUDENT GROUPS' LETTER BLAMING ISRAELIS FOR OWN MASSACRE
A pro-Palestinian Fairfax County school board member named Abrar Omeish reprimanded the board for not including pro-Palestinian language in its memorial to the victims of Hamas attack on Israel.  (Screenshot/FCPS YouTube page)
Cohen addressed the board, saying, ""Many of our board members would like to share our care and concern for the Israeli victims, their loved ones, and our Jewish community who are suffering from Saturday’s vicious terrorist attack by Hamas. We further extend our care and concern for all civilians in Israel, Gaza and the surrounding areas who may be impacted by the ensuing war.""
""Additionally, we wish to reaffirm that antisemitism in all its forms has no place in our schools, and it will not be tolerated,"" she said.
After the students’ musical performance, the meeting was set to go ahead as scheduled, however Omeish interrupted with a request to speak.
Airing her grievances with how the memorial was conducted, she said, ""I wasn’t expecting what seemed to be a sneak attack after we had discussed making sure we represent all children in the ways that we speak and when we speak. So it’s disappointing that my colleagues would do that behind my back after conversations that I had with them in saying that the statement represents everybody’s views.""
She then described how she would have liked the tragedy to have been framed at the meeting. 
""Many are thinking about the incredible devastation and human suffering unfolding today in Israel and Palestine. And we mourn the loss of hundreds of innocent civilians killed and homes destroyed this week alone and the thousands over the decades,"" Omeish said.

Omeish continued by declaring that seeing Israel’s retaliation against an aggressor as a black and white issue is insufficient, stating, ""It might seem simple – aggressors attacking families in a state seeking vengeance – but we often sympathize with and humanize the side that we relate to and the side that looks more like us, or that our biases guide us towards.""
""But doing so ignores the root of the violence,"" she said. Appearing to lessen the moral culpability of Hamas in its terrorism on Saturday, Omeish added, ""Centuries of human history teach us that escalations happen when problems are ignored, realities are denied, and voices are censored. When one narrative dominates from the world stage all the way to our classrooms."" 
She then uttered the social justice quote, ""No justice, no peace,"" and slammed Israel for building an apartheid state and murdering Palestinians.
""When we’re unwilling to call out what global human rights organizations have called an apartheid regime of occupation that has been violating international agreements year after year, and killing thousands of innocent civilians over decades, we are lying to our children."" Omeish said.
""When we don’t give space to hear the Palestinian narrative, we buy into a rhetoric that negates not only the humanness of Palestinians but justifies the indiscriminate retaliation against population.""

Omeish has promoted pro-Palestinian stances in the past. While speaking at a September 2019 American Muslims for Palestine fundraiser before she was put on the school board, she pledged to integrate a pro-Palestinian agenda into classroom books and curriculum, and seemed to suggest that was a motivation for her school board run.
In May 2021, Omeish tweeted that Israel ""desecrates the Holy Land"" and engages in ""apartheid and colonization"" as its civilian areas were bombarded with Hamas rockets.
The board member also once refused to vote on a motion to commemorate Sept. 11 victims and called the Battle of Iwo Jima ""unfortunate"" and ""evil.""
The Fairfax County school board did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

"Hamas terrorists open fire at bus stop near Jerusalem, leaving 3 dead, 11 injured",2023-11-30,Fox News,"['Lawrence Richard', 'Elizabeth Pritchett']","FOX News' Greg Palkot reports the latest from Tel Aviv, Israel. 
A shooting at a bus station near Jerusalem on Thursday morning left three Israelis dead and 11 others with various injuries.
According to Israeli police, the shooting was carried out by two Hamas terrorists who drove to the Givat Shaul junction on the outskirts of the Holy City in an armed vehicle and opened fire on unsuspecting victims standing there. Police responded to the bus stop at around 7:40 a.m. local time.
The three deceased victims of the shooting attack in Jerusalem were identified as 73-year-old Rabbi Elimelech Wasserman, 67-year-old Hana Ifergan, and 24-year-old Livia Dickman.
Israeli police said the two shooters, who were from east Jerusalem, were shot and killed by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers in the area. A civilian was also shot and killed during the exchange.

Israeli media said the shooters were brothers and associated with Hamas.
""The initial investigation indicates that the terrorists arrived to the scene by car in the morning, armed with an M-16 rifle and a handgun,"" a Jerusalem District Police spokesperson said. ""At a certain point, the terrorists began shooting at civilians before subsequently being killed at the scene. A police search of the terrorists' car revealed ammunition and weaponry.""

After days of notable silence surrounding the harrowing terror attacks against Israel that shook the global community this past weekend, supermodel Gigi Hadid took to Instagram on Tuesday to reaffirm her ""deep empathy for the Palestinian struggle.""

I have deep empathy and heartbreak for the Palestinian struggle and life under occupation, it's a responsibility I hold daily. I also feel a responsibility to my Jewish friends to make it clear, as I have before: While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person,"" she wrote.
Hadid argued that being ""Pro-Palestine"" does not make her ""antisemitic.""

""The terrorizing of innocent people is not in alignment with & does not do any good for the 'Free Palestine' movement.' The idea that it does has fueled a painful, decades long cycle of back & forth retaliation (which no innocent civilian, Palestinian or Israeli, deserves to be a casualty of) and helps perpetuate the false idea that being Pro-Palestine = antisemitic,"" the model continued. ""If you are hurting as I share my condolences today with my loves ones, both Palestinian and Jewish, I'm sending you my love and strength - whoever and wherever you are. There are a lot of complex, personal and valid feelings, but every human deserves basic rights, treatment and security; no matter their nationality, religion, ethnicity or where they were born. I know my words will never be enough or heal the deep wounds of so many, but I pray for the safety of innocent lives, always.""

Hadid's comment came hours after her father called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""the new Hitler of modern times"" in an Instagram post. Her sister, model Bella Hadid, who has marched in pro-Palestinian rallies according to videos posted to her social media accounts, has repeatedly been accused of promoting antisemitic rhetoric over the Israeli-Palestinian clash in the past. She has however been notably silent with her roughly 60 million Instagram followers since Hamas launched its barbaric attacks on Israelis over the weekend. Critics have fiercely called out the model for her silence online, with some suggesting she has ""blood"" on her hands for her outspoken support of Palestinians in the past.
MIA KHALIFA
Ex-porn star Mia Khalifa shocked many of her fans this week after she expressed support for Palestinians in a series of social media messages, referring to Palestinian terrorists as ""freedom fighters."" She reposted a message that said, ""Babe wake up Palestine is getting liberated,"" and mocked video of Israelis fleeing from attackers. Khalifa reposted anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian messages throughout the multipronged terrorist attack that left over a thousand dead. Khalifa celebrated as terrifying videos, which included footage of Hamas kidnapping women and children while groups of young party goers were tied up and taken into Gaza, shocked most onlookers.
""If you can look at the situation in Palestine and not be on the side of Palestinians, then you are on the wrong side of apartheid and history will show that in time,"" Khalifa wrote in a message on X that she pinned to her profile.

"String of Hamas, Islamic Jihad rocket misfires have resulted in the deaths of multiple civilians in Gaza: IDF",2023-10-22,Fox News,['Kyle Morris'],"FOX News’ Jonathan Hunt walks through video and audio evidence behind Israel’s claims relating to the Gaza hospital blast.
A steady stream of rocket misfires by Hamas and Islamic Jihad have resulted in the deaths of several Palestinians since the war between Israel and Iran-backed terrorists first began earlier this month, according to one Israeli defense official.
""They are killing their own people,"" Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said Saturday.
Hagari noted that one-fifth of the rockets that have been fired by Hamas and Islamic Jihad have missed intended targets and landed inside Gaza, killing civilians. That number, Hagari said, amounts to more than 550 rockets.
The comments from Hagari came roughly four days after the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was struck by an errant rocket. The blast reportedly left hundreds dead. Hamas initially claimed the hospital was attacked in an Israeli strike; Israel countered after an investigation that it was hit by an errant missile launched by terrorists in Gaza.

Online video that made rounds on social media suggested the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was not directly hit by a rocket on Tuesday. Instead, the missile appears to have struck a nearby parking lot, leading to many conflicting claims of who was responsible, where the missile struck and how many people died.
After an investigation, Israel said the rocket was fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a State Department-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran.
""An analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the al-Ahli [Baptist] Hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,"" IDF officials said. ""Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza.""

President Biden, who was in Israel Wednesday, said intelligence from the Pentagon also supported Israel’s assertion that the blast originated from rocket fire in Gaza. The president reiterated his belief that Israel was not to blame later on Wednesday. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson also reaffirmed the U.S. position.
The string of misfires, according to Joe Truzman, a research analyst for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Long War Journal, is a result of ""Hamas and other groups like Islamic Jihad"" having to ""make do with the material they have.""
ISRAEL ELIMINATES TERRORISTS IN GAZA, LEBANON, WHILE STRIKING HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH TARGETS
""Iran is the chief supporter of several Palestinian armed groups, including other bad actors across the region,"" Truzman told Fox News Digital. ""The regime in Iran funds, arms and supports its network of proxies and clients. The caveat with Palestinian groups in Gaza and the West Bank is that Iran is not able to transfer advanced weapons without the Israelis thwarting it. Iran has likely been able to get some weapons through, but it's a difficult task.
""Because of this hurdle, the Iranians focus on arming Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian terrorist organizations with the know-how to build weapons,"" he explained. ""With this knowledge, Hamas is able to locally produce rockets, mortars, drones and other weapons. While this knowledge has its advantages in the war against Israel, Hamas and other groups like Islamic Jihad have to make do with the materiel they have.""

A chart released by the IDF last week showed an increasing number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets failed upon launch and landed in the Gaza Strip. Nearly 13% of the rockets that were fired toward Israel Oct. 17 landed in the densely populated enclave.
Describing some methods terrorists have used in an effort to achieve their mission, Truzman noted that ""Hamas has dug up underground water pipes that were left behind following the evacuation of Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip.""

""These pipes are used to build rockets. And while it may be a clever method to build up Hamas' arsenal, it doesn't mean the rockets are effective and will always travel to the intended target,"" he added. ""Also, the rockets are produced by terrorist organizations, not a complex arms industry.""
As for why there have been so many misfires, Truzman said he believes it's because the terrorists have not ""perfected"" the process of developing efficient rockets with reliable materials.
""An example of a misfire was filmed last year by a pro-Hamas outfit called al-Mayadeen. The crew filmed a rocket fired by a Palestinian terrorist group, landing short, striking civilian infrastructure,"" he said. ""While Hamas and other groups have learned how to self-produce rockets, it certainly doesn't mean they have perfected it, and this is likely the reason why we are witnessing some of these rockets landing inside the Gaza Strip.""

The Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry claimed Saturday that 4,385 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the war broke out and 3,561 have been wounded in the Israeli strikes. It is unclear how many people in the Gaza Strip have died or been injured as a result of rocket misfires by Hamas and Islamic Jihad terror groups.

US says Hamas refuses to release women hostages to prevent sharing horrors of captivity,2023-12-05,Fox News,['Anders Hagstrom'],"FOX News’ Trey Yingst on the latest from Israel and the IDF considering a new tactic to target Hamas terrorists
The State Department says the U.S. suspects one reason Hamas is refusing to release its remaining female hostages is to prevent them from revealing the horrors they experienced in captivity.
Israeli officials believe Hamas still has roughly 18 women in custody, most of whom were kidnapped from an Oct. 7 music festival near the Gaza border, according to Axios. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller says that Hamas' refusal to release the women led to the collapse of the cease-fire on Friday.
""It seems that one of the reasons they don't want to turn women over that they've been holding hostage — and the reason this pause fell apart — is that they don't want these women to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in custody,"" Miller said during a Monday press briefing.
The statement comes amid heightened tensions regarding Hamas' brutal treatment of women during and after its Oct. 7 massacre. Israel has documented extensive instances of rape and sexual assault and has called on the United Nations to take action.

During a meeting at the U.N. in Geneva last week, Israeli officials attempted to raise awareness of the alleged sexual violence against women and urged the international body – which often condemns global injustices and human rights violations – not to keep quiet about the issue.

""Among the war crimes and the crimes against humanity that Hamas committed on Oct. 7 were also sexual crimes, sexual assaults, rapes, that were part, that were a systematic part of their attack, of the massacre, and we are expecting a strong condemnation,"" said Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, an associate professor at Bar-Ilan University who spoke at the event. ""We expected recognition of that. We expected a clear and loud statement that says that there is no justification for using the bodies of women as a weapon of war. None of this came up until now.""

UN ACCOUNT HIT FOR EXPLICITLY CONDEMNING HAMAS' ATTACK ON ISRAEL EIGHT WEEKS LATER: ‘TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH’
The official UN Women X account faced heavy criticism when it finally condemned the Oct. 7 attack on Friday, roughly two months later.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., faced similar backlash this week when she joined CNN on Sunday for an interview and was asked about the silence from progressive women's groups on Hamas' use of rape as a weapon of war. Jayapal, who chairs the left-wing Congressional Progressive Caucus, claimed she did condemn Hamas' treatment of women specifically, but argued that ""we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians.""

Israel says roughly 137 hostages remain in Gaza, though the U.S. has repeatedly warned that there is no way to know how many of that number are still alive.

University of Maryland Palestinian rally under investigation after apparent calls for ‘Holocaust 2.0’,2023-11-10,Fox News,['Gabriel Hays'],"Hundreds of New York City demonstrators gathered in Brooklyn to show support for Palestine as Hamas terrorists' war with Israel enters its second month. (Source: Peter Gerber)
A pro-Palestinian rally at The University of Maryland is under investigation by the school and Maryland law enforcement after students claimed the demonstration turned ""antisemitic.""
Students spoke out against a Students for Justice in Palestine rally held on campus, Thursday, accusing it of antisemitic messages. Witnesses of the event told a local outlet that messages like ""Holocaust 2.0"" were written in chalk on campus walkways near where the rally was held.
The event led one student to fear for her safety. ""Now that I know what some people on this campus think, I don't feel as safe walking around. Especially alone and especially at night,"" the student told a CBS affiliate.
Another told an ABC outlet that she heard calls for an ""Intifada.""

The pro-Palestinian group that put on the rally says its mission is to ""work in solidarity with the Palestinian people's struggle for human rights."" An Instagram post advertising the rally called on students to ""Walk out and sit in at Hornbake Plaza in calling for a ceasefire and reiterating our demands to the University of Maryland administration!!!""
""Bring flags, kuffiyahs, and chalk!!"" the post added.
It also implored students to ""Stand on the right side of history AGAINST GENOCIDE #ceasefirenow.""
University of Maryland staff acknowledged the ""hateful"" and ""antisemitic"" turn the rally took Thursday and declared that an investigation into the incident was underway. 
In a public statement, school officials said, ""We are aware of hateful, antisemitic sentiment expressed at today’s demonstration by Students for Justice in Palestine. We condemn it in no uncertain terms. The offensive actions of a few should not reflect on the vast majority of protesters who were there to peacefully express their views, but there is no place for any antisemitic message, behavior or action at the University of Maryland.""
The statement also noted that Maryland police are on the case as well, adding, ""The University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD) has launched an immediate investigation and continues to conduct real-time threat assessments. Responsible parties will be held accountable.""

The Anti-Defamation League’s D.C. chapter and University of Maryland Jewish groups put out a joint statement Friday condemning the rally.
""We are deeply disturbed that students at University of Maryland were met yesterday with antisemitic graffiti that said, ‘Holocaust 2.0.’ This imagery is deeply troubling whether it was meant to trivialize the Holocaust or seen as a direct threat against Jewish students. Either way it is dangerous and unacceptable,"" they stated.
Students for Justice in Palestine is a far-left group which celebrated the Hamas terrorist attack as a ""historic"" victory for Palestinian resistance. Brandeis University said Monday it will no longer recognize Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) on its campus.
The school’s spokesperson Julie Jette told Fox News Digital, ""National SJP has called on its chapters to engage in conduct that supports Hamas in its call for the elimination of the only Jewish state in the world and its people. Such expression is not protected by Brandeis' principles of free speech.""
It was also suspended from campus on Friday by Columbia University.
The University of Maryland didn't respond to a request for comment.
