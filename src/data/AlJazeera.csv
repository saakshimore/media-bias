"Israel-Hamas war: List of key events, day 61 | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera",2023-12-06T08:19:38,AlJazeera,,"Here’s how things stand on Wednesday,December 6, 2023:

How Israel is squeezing 1.8 million Palestinians into an airport-sized area | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera,2023-12-06T10:02:34,AlJazeera,,"The Israeli military has asked Palestinian residents of Gaza to evacuate to a part of the town ofal-Mawasiin the south of the besieged strip, designating it as a safe space.
The directive comes at a time when Israel has stepped up its bombing of southern Gaza, especially around the city of Khan Younis, which the Israeli military claims is sheltering leaders of Hamas.
But can the space declared “safe” by Israeli authorities actually accommodate the more than 1.8 million Palestinians who have been forced to evacuate their homes since the outbreak of violence onOctober 7?
A coastal Bedouin town in the south of the Gaza Strip, al-Mawasi is small and narrow – about 1km (0.6 miles) wide and 14km (8.7 miles) long. It had been surrounded by Israelisettlementsuntil former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon disengaged settlements from Gaza in 2005.
Israel has declared a mere 6.5sq km (2.5sq miles) of desolate, sandy terrain, within the city to be the humanitarian area where evacuees are supposed to seek shelter.
That is an area half the size of London’s Heathrow Airport. About 61 million passengers passed through Heathrow in 2022, or about 167,000 a day on average.
In other words, the population density in the “safe” part of al-Mawasi would be more than 20 times that of Heathrow — even if all of the airport’s daily passengers were present there at the same time.

Israel’s increasing bombardment of southern Gaza after the collapse of a truce hasthinnedfor safe zone options for Palestinians during the bloody war that has exceeded 60 days. Israel has deemed that Khan Younis, which was once rendered safe, is now a “dangerous combat zone”.
While Israel has claimed there are safe zones for civilians in Gaza, residents have said no place is safe, and experts pointed out that spaces earmarked by Israel for people to evacuate to are too small or incapable of hosting large displaced populations.
Ramallah-based legal expert Bushra Khalidi told Al Jazeera, “Gaza was already overpopulated … [now] we’re talking about 1.8 million people in an airport.”
Khalidi added that cholera and gastroenteritis are rapidly spreading due to the congested conditions. “People are not getting better because conditions are not allowing them to get better,” she said.
Khalidi is not the first to criticise Israel’s declaration of al-Mawasi as a safe space. World Health Organization (WHO) chiefTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuscalled the Israeli proposal a recipe for disaster on November 17.
“Attempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services will significantly increase risks to health for people who are already on the brink,” he said, adding that the WHO will not participate in the establishment of any so-called “safe zone” in Gaza “without broad agreement, and unless fundamental conditions are in place to ensure safety and other essential needs are met, and a mechanism is in place to supervise its implementation”.
A team from Sky News visited al-Mawasi to investigate the situation there. They found no shelter arrangements, such as agency tents or food kitchens. The area has already been facing a severe lack of healthcare facilities.

"Putin to visit Saudi Arabia, UAE with Israel-Hamas war on agenda | Politics News | Al Jazeera",2023-12-05T18:12:17,AlJazeera,,"Russian President Vladimir Putin, staking out a more influential role in the Middle East, will visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, and host Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Moscow the following day.
The talks will focus on bilateral relations and theIsrael-Hamas war,Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.
Peskov said that discussions on oil market cooperation will be on the agenda of talks, as Moscow cooperates with all three countries through OPEC+, which is comprised of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia.
“These discussions are held within the OPEC+ format, but of course, cooperation in this area is always on the agenda,” said Peskov.
The OPEC+ group, which Putin helped create in 2016, announcednew voluntary supply cutslast week, which met scepticism from the oil market.





Separately, Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said that Saudi-Russian cooperation within the oil cooperation body was “fruitful”.
“Fairly close Russian-Saudi coordination in this format is a reliable guarantee of maintaining a stable and predictable situation in the global oil market,” Ushakov said, according to Russian news agencies.
Putin’s drive to bolster its ties with Gulf and other Middle Eastern states is part of his efforts to demonstrate that Western attempts to isolate Moscow throughsanctions for its war on Ukrainehave failed.
The Russian leader has not made many international trips after the International Criminal Court (ICC)issued an arrest warrant for himin March, accusing Putin of deporting Ukrainian children.
Neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia have signed the ICC’s founding treaty, meaning they would not have to arrest him if he entered their territories.
With regards to Israel’s current bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s October 7 attacks, Putin has sought to cast the war as a failure of U.S. diplomacy, charging that Washington had opted for economic “handouts” to the Palestinians and abandoned efforts to help create a Palestinian state.
He has suggested Moscow could play the role of mediator, thanks to its friendly ties with both Israel and the Palestinians, saying that “no one could suspect us of playing up to one party.”

Israeli captives’ families angry after meeting with Netanyahu | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera,2023-12-06T04:22:26,AlJazeera,,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met families of captives freed from Gaza in an encounter described as tense by the Israeli media.
Tuesday’s meeting came amidintensified fightingin the besieged Gaza Strip following the end of a seven-day pause in hostilities that enabled the return of more than 100 captives, who had been taken by the Palestinian armed group Hamas during its October 7 attack on Israel, in exchange for some 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
Israel said on Tuesday that some138 captivesremained in the territory.
Several of the relatives who attended the meeting left bitterly critical of the government.
Dani Miran, whose son Omri was among those taken captive, said he was so disgusted he had walked out in the middle of the meeting.
“I won’t go into the details of what was discussed but this entire performance was ugly, insulting, messy,” he told Israel’s Channel 13, saying the government had made a “farce” out of the issue.
“They say, ‘We’ve done this, we’ve done that’. [Hamas’ Gaza leader Yahya] Sinwar is the one who returned our people, not them. It angers me that they say that they dictated things. They hadn’t dictated a single move.”
Israel says several women and children remain in Hamas’s hands, while families with adult male relatives in captivity have been calling for them not to be forgotten.
“It was a very turbulent meeting, many people yelling,” said Jennifer Master, whose partner Andrey is still being held by Hamas.
“We are all trying to make sure our loved ones get home. There are those who want the women who are left or the children who are left, and those who say we want the men,” Master told Israel’s Channel 12.
Family members called for immediate action to secure the release of the remaining captives.
“I asked Netanyahu if the primary objective of the war was to bring back the hostages,” Meirav Leshem Gonen, mother of 23-year-old hostage Romi Gonen, told Israeli television after the meeting.
“He answered me directly: ‘Yes’,” she said. “I am happy with his answer, but only reality counts.”





Leshem Gonen said she was concerned that captives were being “severely mistreated — women, young girls, and men too”.
Speaking at a news conference afterwards, Netanyahu said he had heard stories that “broke my heart” and included thirst and hunger, as well as physical and mental abuse.
“I heard and you also heard, about sexual assault and cases of brutal rape unlike anything,” he added.
Israel has said it is investigating several cases of alleged sexual assault and rape committed by Hamas fighters during their October 7 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed.
Witnesses and medical experts have said some fighters committed rape and other attacks before killing the victims, although the extent of the sexual violence remains unknown. Hamas has denied carrying out such assaults.
Israel began an intense bombardment of Gaza in the wake of Hamas’s attack, saying it wanted to destroy the group and free the captives. The attacks have killed more than 16,200 people in Gaza, according to Hamas, which has controlled the territory since 2006.
Some families, meanwhile, appeared to be losing patience with Netanyahu’s government.
“We have faith in our children, that they are strong and they will overcome this, and we want our government and the military to do what they do as fast as they can — as fast as possible — to start the negotiations,” said Idit Ohel, the mother of 21-year-old hostage Alon, during an online panel organised by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
“Sixty days is too much,” she said, her voice rising. “I don’t want 61 days, I don’t want 65 days. I want them back now.”
Israel withdrew its negotiators from Qatar on December 2, blaming an “impasse” after failing to make progress in talks aimed at securing a renewed pause in hostilities.
Afterwards, Hamas said it would not release any more captives until the war in Gaza was ended.

The IHRA definition of anti-Semitism has no place on Australian campuses | Israel-Palestine conflict | Al Jazeera,2023-12-06T14:00:29,AlJazeera,"Micaela Sahhar, Sahar Ghumkhor, Jasmine Barzani, Natalie Ironfield","In universities across the world, the definition of anti-Semitism put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) has been used to silence critical commentary on Israel’s human rights violations and war crimes. In Australia, the definition has been having a chilling effect on campuses across the country.
Amid Israel’s relentless bombing of Gaza, which has killed nearly 16,000 people, including more than 6,000 children, students and staff who have organised in solidarity with the Palestinian people have faced pressure and intimidation.
At the University of Melbourne, the highest-ranked institution of higher education in Oceania, the university’s administration has openly embraced the official Israeli narrative and refused to condemn what legal experts have called a textbook case of genocide.
While students and staff have tried to resist attempts at censorship and silencing, what is happening at the university is a good illustration of how the IHRA definition hurts academic freedom on campus and helps propagate colonial violence.
In November 2022, the Parliamentary Friends of IHRA group was created, consisting of members of the Australian parliament. One of its first tasks was to write to all Australian, universities, urging them to adopt the IHRA definition.
Following this announcement, the peak body for Palestinians in Australia, the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, asked to be included in university deliberations on the subject but its call was unheeded.
Since then, five Australian universities have adopted the IHRA definition, while seven, including high-profile Australian National University and the University of Adelaide, have publicly rejected the call.
The University of Melbourne was the first to publicly announce the adoption of the IHRA definition in January 2023. This was framed as the first step in its new antiracism initiative, with consultations to follow among Muslim staff and students in respect of a statement on Islamophobia.
This approach highlighted the anti-Palestinianism at the heart of the university’s adoption of the IHRA definition as it implied that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is sectarian in nature.
Both Palestinian and Jewish academics have argued that the adoption of the IHRA definition undermines the fight against racism and have pointed to the context in which it was carried out – to impede campus activism challenging Israeli apartheid.
As a group of university scholars in Australia have written: “[The] IHRA definition is not only vague but also not grounded in contemporary anti-racism scholarship or practice. It treats antisemitism as if it occurs in isolation from other forms of racism and disconnects the struggle against antisemitism from the struggle against other forms of racism.”
Particularly in Australia, a settler colony, fighting racism must begin with – and be grounded in – solidarity with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
Kenneth Stern, author of the definition, has explained that it was never intended to be used for this purpose of limiting what can be said at universities. Using it in this way, he wrote, is deeply harmful for all.
The IHRA is a problem not just in Australia, but across the Global North. In response to a report compiled for the #NoIHRA project, prepared by Independent Jewish Voices, Amos Goldberg, Professor of Holocaust History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem noted “how powerful, cynical and vicious the weaponization of the fight against antisemitism for silencing critique of Israel and Zionism has become”.
Even before the IHRA definition was adopted by the University of Melbourne, there were already attempts at intimidation and silencing of those who speak out against Zionism on campus.
In May 2022, the People of Colour department at the University of Melbourne’s Student Union (UMSU) passed a motion, rigorously supported by evidence gathered by international human rights organisations, that criticised political Zionism and called for participation in the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement. Threats of a costly lawsuit from a Liberal Party member intimidated UMSU into rescinding their motion.
This tactic of lawfare has had a chilling effect on campuses, restricting political freedom. A Palestinian master’s student described to us the impact of such actions on his student experience: “I’ve been made to feel that my life and that of my people is less worthy and less valuable than that of Israeli and Zionist students on campus.”
The adoption of the IHRA definition has only further encouraged the trend of curbing the freedom of expression on campus.
For Palestinian and Muslim students and staff whose criticism of Zionism is silenced by accusations of anti-Semitism, not only is their expertise challenged but their experiences of racism are often dismissed. As one academic described to us:
“I have lived experiences of racism and Islamophobia. I know first-hand how much these actions hurt. So, I don’t take it lightly to be accused of hate or racism…. It is unfair and traumatic that those of us who have been subjects of racism are now being silenced through accusations of racism.”
Both Palestinian and Jewish students and staff are harmed by the IHRA definition’s mischaracterisation of their lived experiences. As a Jewish academic noted to us: “In the past I’ve had frivolous complaints from Zionist students about my lectures, and given what we know about complaints under IHRA overseas (that they are plentiful but “unreasonable”) there is a concern about the effects for all, most particularly Palestinians, with rising complaints. This is not the way to address anti-Semitism.”
Other academics feel a similar pressure in the classroom. One in the School of Social and Political Sciences shared that “it’s always challenging teaching in the area of political violence and it’s not always comfortable for students to critically reflect on governments or nations they might identify with, but now I am worried about having to tailor my teaching so it’s less critical to avoid being targeted and smeared with charges of anti-Semitism”.
The risks to students include the future of their education. A law student involved in a recent Gaza fundraiser that was targeted by Zionists on campus shared concerns about possible disciplinary action: “We were all apprehensive about the potential consequences organising the fundraiser would have on our enrolment at the university.”
Speaking against Israel’s justifications for the ongoing massacre of Palestinians is now cited by precariously employed academics at the University of Melbourne as yet another reason for work-related stress and anxiety.
While students and staff at the University of Melbourne and elsewhere have been facing the added pressure of the IHRA definition, they have not stayed silent on the brutal Israeli war on Gaza.
On October 25, Vice-Chancellor Duncan Maskell issued a statement “concerning the Israel-Gaza war” in which he presented Israel as the injured party defending itself against an “act of terrorism committed by Hamas”. He expressed no criticism of Israel’s actions, which have been defined as amounting to genocide by legal experts.
The statement caused outrage across campus. An open letter was drafted in response and signed by more than 2,500 staff, students and alumni.
“We express our grave concern about how this misrepresentation of Israel’s genocidal attack against the people of Palestine will contribute to further loss of life in Gaza and harm to Palestinian students, staff and alumni of the University,” it stated.
The open letter also invited signatories to include a statement in their university email signature that calls on the university to rescind its adoption of the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism.
The public list of names in the open letter challenges the censorship instilled by the IHRA definition and aims to defend academic freedom on campus. Beyond the letter, other groups on campus also spoke up.
The criminology discipline at the University of Melbourne, for example, unified in their stance against the vice-chancellor’s statement, collectively issued a response,tweeting:
“We are particularly concerned by the conflation of criticism of Israel’s policies and actions with antisemitism, and the policing of solidarity with Palestine. As Criminology activists and scholars, we stand united against the criminalisation and silencing of the right to speak truth to power.”
It is telling that the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU), which has increasingly been representative of low-income casual workers, joined over 100 trade unions in Australia that came out to unequivocally condemn Israel’s bloodiest assault on Gaza.
As Palestinian trade unions call on workers internationally to escalate economic pressure by leveraging their labour power, there is an urgency for higher education workers to also go beyond verbal condemnation.
As Israel’s indiscriminate killing of Palestinians in Gaza, as well as the West Bank, continues, the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism is emerging as a clear obstacle to critical scholarship and action in resisting and denouncing such atrocities. The use of this definition has no place on Australian campuses.

"As Bosniaks, we have a duty to speak up for Gaza | Opinions | Al Jazeera",2023-12-06T14:36:50,AlJazeera,Nadina Ronc,"The sound of gunfire echoes throughout the city. Explosions light up the night sky as bombs destroy homes, schools, marketplaces and any signs of life in them. Overwhelmed and under attack, health workers in a few, barely functioning hospitals struggle to help the injured, mostly children. Nowhere is safe – starvation, thirst and death are everywhere.
No, this is not the siege of Sarajevo, some three decades ago. This is Gaza, now. Though one can be excused for mistaking one for the other. Today, Palestinians in the besieged enclave are facing a catastrophe that is in many ways identical to the one my people, Bosnian Muslims, had to endure in the 1990s.
Israel claims its war is against Hamas, and not the civilian population of Gaza. It says it is merely “defending itself”, and not aiming to displace hundreds of thousands of people and acquire more Palestinian land. Yet the reality on the ground does not match these claims. Israel’s relentless offensive is not only targeting Hamas. Its siege and bombs are killing civilians in their thousands, eradicating entire bloodlines, displacing many more, and – by the admission of some of Israel’s leaders themselves – aiming to erase all traces of Palestinian life and heritage from Gaza. This is not self-defence, this is not disproportionate retribution, this is genocide.
In 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) judged that what happened in Srebrenica in 1995 – the targeted killing of more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys as well as the mass displacement of tens of thousands of other Bosniak civilians – was genocide. Announcing the ruling at the Hague, Presiding Judge Theodor Meron stated that “By seeking to eliminate a part of the Bosnian Muslims, the Bosnian Serb forces committed genocide.” Is this not exactly what Israel is trying to do in Gaza? What can explain the targeting of highly populated residential areas, hospitals and United Nations schools sheltering displaced civilians with allegedly surgical air strikes other than a desire to “eliminate” at least a part of the population living there?
There is no doubt that crimes were committed by Hamas in southern Israel on October 7. Hundreds of Israeli civilians were killed, maimed or taken hostage, which cannot in any way be justified. But the genocide Israel embarked on in response to these crimes, or its decades-old repression and dispossession of Palestinians that led to the emergence of Hamas in the first place, cannot be justified, either.
As a survivor of the Bosnian war, whose relatives were put in concentration camps, I cannot stay silent as Israel commits a genocide. Failing to condemn what Israel is doing to the people of Gaza would mean that I learned nothing from what has been done to my people.
Bosnians have experienced first hand the horrific consequences of the international community remaining silent in the face of blatant war crimes and crimes against humanity. Indeed, we know what happens when the world decides to sit back and watch the gradual destruction of a people in silence. I believe this is why there is now a sea of Palestinian flags fluttering in the wind during protests in Sarajevo. Ordinary Bosnians are standing with the people of Gaza and saying no to genocide because they know this is the right thing to do.
And yet, not all Bosnians seem to feel this way.
In response to the criticism of his deafening silence on Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza, Emir Suljagic, the director of Srebrenica Memorial Centre, said, “This is not our battle.” In a November 26 interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Suljagic detailed how the Hamas attack on October 7 reminded him of the early days of the Bosnia war, and condemned the Palestinian armed group. He went on to defend his refusal to comment on Israel’s consequent war on Gaza, saying he will not sacrifice his organisation’s work “at the altar of whatever Hamas’s agenda is”.
I find this stance utterly perplexing, and deeply disappointing.
If this is not “our battle”, then why say anything? If it is not to condemn war crimes on both sides, why speak at all? If commenting on international conflicts risks damaging the work of the memorial centre, why does it appear to be OK topublicly supportUkrainian resistance against Russia’s invasion?
Some tie Suljagic’s seemingly unconditional support for Israel to his long-term collaboration with the World Jewish Congress (WJC) and other pro-Israel groups, as part of his work for the memorial centre. Yet by failing to speak up against this war on Palestinian civilians, for whatever reason, Suljagic is failing to do his duty. Indeed, by turning a blind eye to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza, Suljagic is betraying the lessons learned from the Srebrenica genocide. And by trying to draw a false equivalence between Hamas and those responsible for the Srebrenica genocide he is undermining the gravity of the crimes committed against Bosnians.
In a now-deleted tweet from November 21, Suljagic claimed that there was “no difference” between Hamas and the Chetniks – the Yugoslav royalist and Serbian nationalist guerrilla force which committed some of the worst atrocities during the Bosnia war.
Chetniks put Bosniaks in concentration camps. They looted and besieged Bosnian towns. They tortured, starved, abused, raped and killed civilians in their thousands. They bombed hospitals, killing doctors and patients. They attacked libraries and town halls shielding the displaced. The mass graves Chetniks created and filled with Bosniaks during those dark years are still being unearthed across the country today. They did all this because they wanted to exterminate Bosnian Muslims. They committed genocide. And Sulajic, as a survivor of genocide, knows this very well.
Hamas’s crimes against Israeli civilians on October 7, however horrific, were in no way comparable. There is only one party in this conflict which has ever committed crimes against civilians that are as systemic and widespread as those committed by Chetniks against Bosniaks in the 1990s, and that is Israel.
It is Israel that is keeping civilians under siege. It is Israel that is indiscriminately bombing and starving them. It is Israel that is imprisoning young Palestinians en masse, stealing their dreams and futures. It is Israel that is committing a genocide.
Suljagic’s silence on Israel’s occupation, apartheid and ongoing genocide reflects an “I’m alright, Jack” attitude that implies Bosnians can turn a blind eye to genocide, and claim it is “not our battle”, under certain conditions. In that case, however, we can no longer point the finger at those who remained silent when we were facing genocide. We cannot stand tall and say we will do everything we can to ensure this does not happen again, to anyone.
So for the Palestinian people, and for humanity’s collective future, we should all do better. Bosniaks, and everyone else who recognises what is happening in Gaza as genocide, should speak up and demand an end to this atrocity. But just an end to this war is not enough. We should demand an end to the occupation and apartheid. We should demand a return to the 1967 borders. Palestinians should be allowed to live freely and with dignity on their own land.
We must support the Palestinian people and their struggle for liberation. Silence and abstention are not options, especially for those of us who are unfortunate to have experienced war, genocide and oppression. Now that we are on the other side, now that we are not the ones under siege and facing bombardment, we have a duty to speak up for those who are – even if it means upsetting allies and friends. In the words of Martin Luther King, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”

Israeli raid kills 22 members of Al Jazeera correspondent’s family in Gaza | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera,2023-12-06T17:17:11,AlJazeera,,"An Al Jazeera employee has lost 22 members of his family in an Israeli air attack on the home in which they were sheltering in the Gaza Strip.
The family members of Moamen Al Sharafi, a correspondent for Al Jazeera Arabic, were killed early on Wednesday morning at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.
Al Sharafi’s parents Mahmoud and Amina, his siblings and their spouses, as well as nephews and nieces were among those killed.
Al Sharafi told Al Jazeera an explosive barrel hit the home, causing a deep crater in the ground.
“None of the civil defence crews were able to reach their bodies,” he said.
“We are prevented from saying goodbye to our loved ones and are deprived of giving them a proper burial.”





A video shot after the attack showed a relative of Al Sharafi wailing as he stood at the debris of the house that was bombed.
“It looks like they hit the house at around 4 or 5 in the morning. We couldn’t reach the scene until the sun was up,” said the relative, adding that several children were killed.
Al Sharafi, meanwhile, shared the contents of the last voice message his mother Amina sent to him before she was killed in the bombing.
“Assalam Aalaykum. Good morning, Momin. How are you? I hope you are well. How are your wife and children? How is your health? Take care of yourself, son,” she is heard saying in the voice note.
“May Allah bring you out of this war unharmed. Take good care of yourself. I really miss you, I pray for you every day. May God bless you.”
In a statement, the Al Jazeera Media Network denounced the Israeli attack and said it “will pursue all legal steps to holding accountable all those responsible for this crime”.
“The horrific event unfolded today [Wednesday] at Jabalia Camp, where Moamen’s family sought refuge, leading to the killing his father, mother, three siblings and his children,” said the network.
“Al Jazeera calls on the international community and press freedom organisations to work to put an end to these massacres immediately and ensure prompt justice for the families of the martyrs and the innocent victims,” it added.
On October 25, an Israeli raid killed several family members ofWael Dahdouh, another Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent in Gaza.
Mohamed Abu Al-Qumsan, a broadcast engineer with Al Jazeera’s bureau in Gaza, alsolost 19 family members, including his father and two sisters, in Israeli air raids on the Jabalia refugee camp on October 31.
At least 16,248 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200.

US lawmakers lag voters in support for Gaza ceasefire | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera,2023-12-06T08:49:39,AlJazeera,,"Support among members of the United States Congress for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war is far lower than among voters.
Data for Progress, a progressive US think tank,saidon Tuesday that 61 percent of likely US voters support calls for a permanent ceasefire and a de-escalation of violence in Israel’s war on the besieged Palestinian enclave, which has killed more than 16,000 people since October 7.
Citing the poll in a post on social media platform X, Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib questioned why so few members of the government were aligned with the public’s views on this, noting that only 11 percent of Congress has called for a ceasefire. A full 76 percent of Democrat voters support a ceasefire.
61% of Americans support a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

57% of Independents.

— Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (@RepRashida)December 5, 2023

Last week, Tlaib – the only Palestinian-American member of Congress whowas censuredby the US House of Representatives on November 7 – hit out at the White House for calling the few dozen lawmakers who demanded a ceasefire early in the war “repugnant”.
The Data for Progress survey, which polled over 1,000 likely US voters in late November, said the majority of respondents were concerned about the rise in hate towards Jewish communities, Arabs and Muslims in the US since the start of the war.
On Tuesday, the US House passed a measure equating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, a move Palestinian rights advocates denounced as“dangerous”, warning that it aims to curb free speech and distract from the war.
When asked what the US government should prioritise in its foreign policy approach to the crisis, about half of the poll’s respondents mentioned diplomatic efforts, and some 30 percent mentioned humanitarian assistance.
“Fewer than 1 in 4 voters (24%) choose ‘sending additional military aid and weapons to Israel’ — and only 11% choose ‘sending US troops to assist Israeli forces in Gaza’ as a priority,” Data for Progress noted.
The US government providesbillionsin military support to Israel and has sent additional taxpayer money since the war began.
However, the Biden administration on Tuesdayannounceda move to impose visa restrictions on “extremist” Israeli settlers involved in undermining peace, security or stability in the occupied West Bank.
This represents a “shift in the stance” on the conflict, Youcef Bouandel, a professor of political science and international relations at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera. However, he added the move does not “go far enough”.
Ariel Gold, the executive director of the US-based Fellowship of Reconciliation, told Al Jazeera the policy was “virtue signalling” as many settlers hold dual citizenship and do not require a visa to enter the US.
Last month, a different poll byGallupfound that 45 percent of Americans disapproved of Israel’s military action in Gaza. It found that 63 percent of Democrats, 64 percent of people of colour, and 67 percent of young people aged 18-34 all opposed the war.
Only 32 percent of Americans approved of President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas situation, Gallup said.

Why is Israel at war with the UN? | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera,2023-12-06T13:29:13,AlJazeera,,"Israel on Wednesday announced its decision to revoke the residence visa of United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator Lynn Hastings on Wednesday.
“Someone who did not condemn Hamas for the brutal massacre of 1,200 Israelis … but instead condemns Israel, a democratic country that protects its citizens, cannot serve in the UN and cannot enter Israel!” wrote Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen on X.

— אלי כהן | Eli Cohen (@elicoh1)December 5, 2023

But the incident is only the latest in a series of instances of Israel clashing with the UN over the war in Gaza in ways that are uncommon for member states of the global body.
Hastings said on Monday that “the conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist”.
The UN official also warned that “If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond.” She was referring to the resumption of Israel’s bombardment on Gaza following the end of a temporary pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas.
The Israeli response – to effectively put in motion the expulsion of Hastings from occupied Palestinian territories – marks the latest setback to its taut ties with the UN.
On October 25, Israel’s ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan said that his countrywould refuse visasto UN officials after the body’s Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticised Israel for ordering civilians to evacuate from north to south Gaza.
Guterres also saidHamas’s attack on Israelon October 7 did not happen “in a vacuum” as the Palestinians have been “subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation”.
Earlier, on October 18, after thebombing of the AhliArab Hospital in Gaza, Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire in the region,condemningthecollective punishmentof Palestinians.
Then, on November 14, Israel’s foreign minister Eli Cohen said that Guterres was not fit to lead the UN since he had not done enough to condemn Hamas.
Israeli journalist Almog Boker alleged on November 29 that one of the captives released during the temporary pause was held by a teacher at a school run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
The UNRWA released a statement on December 1, calling this allegationunsubstantiated. “UNRWA and other entities in the United Nations have asked the journalist to provide more information on what we consider to be a very serious allegation. Despite repeated demands, the journalist has not responded,” the statement said.
🛑 Spreading unsubstantiated claims about@UNRWAmust stop immediately.

Israel’s aggression towards the UNRWA is not limited to allegations against its teachers. Several UNRWA schools have been targets of Israeli bombardment.
On November 18, it was reported that at least 50 people were killed in anIsraeli attack on the Al Fakhoura school. On November 23, it was reported that 27 were killed inIsrael’s attack on the Abu Hussein school.
At least 47 UNRWA buildings have been damaged throughout the war.
UNRWA is currently hosting about 1.2 million civilians – two-thirds of all displaced people in Gaza – in its shelters across the north and south of the Strip.
At least 130 UNRWA staff have been killed in Israeli bombings throughout the war. This is the highest number of UN personnel killed in a conflict in the history of the organisation.
The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X on Monday saying the agency received a notification from the Israeli military to remove its medical supplies from southern Gaza within 24 hours. “We appeal to #Israel to withdraw the order, and take every possible measure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and humanitarian facilities,” he wrote.
Today,@WHOreceived notification from the Israel Defense Forces that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use.

Israel responded, denying that it had issued such a warning.“From a UN official we would expect, at least, to be more accurate,” COGAT, the Israeli body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs in Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank, posted on X.
Ghebreyesus earlier criticised Israel’s proposal for a patch of land in the narrow coastalal-Mawasi townto be considered a safe zone in Gaza, calling it a recipe for disaster on November 17.
The WHO chief said that the WHO would not participate in the establishment of any so-called “safe zone” in Gaza “without broad agreement, and unless fundamental conditions are in place to ensure safety and other essential needs are met, and a mechanism is in place to supervise its implementation”.
Israel has repeatedly targeted Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, a trenchant critic of Israel’s policies.
On December 4, after Albanese drew parallels between the dehumanisation of Jews ahead of the Holocaust and Israel’s war on Gaza, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy hit back. Levy accused Albanese of Holocaust inversion.
Disgusting Holocaust inversion from a shameless Hamas-complicit official who we thought couldn’t sink any lower, but has.https://t.co/MuC58Tq4Sr

"Israel army in most intense combat in Gaza war, no safe place to evacuate | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera",2023-12-06T09:12:30,AlJazeera,Al Jazeera Staff,"The Israeli army has widened its attacks in southern and central Gaza, with some of the heaviest fighting in thewarseeing homes sheltering displaced Palestinians bombed, refugee camps hit and no safe place left to evacuate thousands of people already on the move for weeks.
From early Wednesday morning, “under heavy aerial bombardment, Israeli tanks started pushing deeper and deeper to the centre ofKhan Youniscity, coming from the eastern side,” reported Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah, in southern Gaza, forcing hundreds of people to flee the area.
“Everybody thought the eastern areas of Khan Younis were the main target, as the leaflets that were dropped on the residents stated, but it seems like the entire city of Khan Younis is under heavy bombardment right now,” Mahmoud said, of the leaflets dropped by Israeli forces ordering residents to evacuate.
Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said that Israel’s military was gearing up for days of intense battle in Khan Younis, which it views as a key Hamas stronghold where many leaders could be stationed.
However, Israel’s military must move cautiously as it believes numerous captives could also be there, said Fisher, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem.
“It’s all part of a plan to move the operation further south,” he said. “We’re likely to see [the Israeli military’s] intense operation extend four or five weeks until the middle of January.”
The next few days could bring the heaviest fighting of the two-month war, he added.
Mahmoud said that “after this point, there are no options for Palestinians to go anywhere. The only option that might be feasible or even possible for Palestinians is crossing into Egypt, but with the current situation, it seems very, very difficult”.
“Under heavy bombardment, people were being pushed first into the central part [of Gaza], then Khan Younis, and now Rafah,” he reported, adding that “more than 1.5 million people have been squeezed into this pocket of land that’s really populated with people”.
There were also relentless assaults on Deir el-Balah in central Gaza through the night, reported Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary from the area. She said there were “non-stop explosions, non-stop artillery shelling and non-stop clashes. Multiple homes were bombed”.
“The number of wounded being brought to the hospital is massive. Doctors and paramedics have not been able to save them all,” Khoudary said, describing the intensity of the attacks and noting that “it is very dangerous for people to leave for either the north or the south. At the same time, conditions here are very harsh. There is no food in the markets. Even the little food that was once available is not any more since the centre has been split off from the south.”





At least six people were killed and 14 wounded in an Israeli air strike on theNuseirat refugee campin central Gaza. An Al Jazeera team at the site of the strike reported on Wednesday that people were trapped under the rubble of a building that was hit.
As the injured are rushed to the few remaining functional hospitals in the area, relief organizations sounded the alarm that supplies were perilously low.
The international medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, warned thatAl-Aqsa Martyrs Hospitalin Deir el-Balah was running out of options.
“There are 700 patients admitted in the hospital now, with new patients arriving all the time,” MSF emergency coordinator Marie-Aure Perreaut Revial said. “We are running out of essential supplies to treat them.”
At least 16,248 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200.

"‘Anti-Zionism is antisemitism,’ US House asserts in ‘dangerous’ resolution | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera",2023-12-06T01:36:36,AlJazeera,Ali Harb,"Washington, DC –Palestinian rights advocates are denouncing a congressional resolution that equates anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, calling it a “dangerous” measure that aims to curb free speech and distract from thewar in Gaza.
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed themeasureon Tuesday in a 311-14 vote, with 92 Democratic members abstaining by voting “present”.
The symbolic resolution was framed as an effort to reject the “drastic rise of anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world”.
But it contained language saying that the House “clearly and firmly states that anti-Zionism is antisemitism”. It also condemned the slogan “From the River to the Sea”, which rights advocates understand to be an aspirationalcall for equalityin historic Palestine.
Instead, the resolution described it as a “rallying cry for the eradication of the State of Israel and the Jewish people”. It also characterised demonstrators whogathered in Washington, DC,last month to demand a ceasefire as “rioters”. They “spewed hateful and vile language amplifying antisemitic themes”, the resolution alleges.
Husam Marajda, an organiser with the US Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), said the resolution is an effort to “cancel” Palestinian rights advocates by accusing them of bigotry and labelling their criticism of Israeli policies as hate speech.
“It’s super dangerous. It sets a really, really bad precedent. It’s aiming to criminalise our liberation struggle and our call for justice and peace and equality,” Marajda told Al Jazeera.





Zionism is a nationalist ideology that helped establish the state of Israel in 1948. It contends that the Jewish people have a right to self-determination in historic Palestine, which Zionists view as their ancestral homeland.
The rise of Zionism in the late 1800s was partly in response to anti-Semitism in Europe.
But many Palestinians reject Zionism as a driver of the settler colonialism that dispossessed them during the founding of Israel. Israel’s establishment coincided with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who were forcibly driven from their homes in what is knownas the Nakba, the Arabic word for “catastrophe”.
While Palestinians view themselves as the native people of the land, Zionists say Jewish people have historic and biblical claims to what is today Israel.
Some hardline Zionists, including members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, argue that the present-day Palestinian territories — the West Bank and Gaza — also belong to Israel.
At a United Nations General Assembly speech in November, Netanyahuheld up a mapof Israel that showed the country stretching from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, encompassing the West Bank, Gaza and Syria’s Golan Heights.
Some Palestinians also blame Zionism for Israeli abuses against them, whichamount to apartheid, according to leading human rights groups like Amnesty International.
In the US, Palestinian rights supporters have long rejected conflations of Zionism with Judaism, noting that many Jewish Americans identify as anti-Zionist.
“Opposing the policies of the government of Israel and Netanyahu’s extremism is not antisemitic. Speaking up for human rights and a ceasefire to save lives should never be condemned,” Palestinian American Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib said in a social media post on Tuesday, explaining her vote against the resolution.





Marajda stressed that Palestinians have a right to oppose Zionism, a position he said has nothing to do with prejudice.
“This resolution is saying that if you’re critical ofthis Israeli government, essentially you hate Jewish people,” he said. “I didn’t choose — the Palestinians didn’t choose — their occupiers.”
The resolution is one of several pro-Israel motions approved by Congress since October 7. Most US legislators have expressed unwavering support for Israel amid its offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 16,000 Palestinians.
Yasmine Taeb, the legislative and political director at MPower Change, a Muslim American advocacy group, called the resolution “extremely dangerous”.
“It unequivocally equates any criticism of the Israeli government with anti-Semitism. Essentially it smears millions and millions of people demonstrating globally in support of alasting ceasefire, including Jewish-American organisations,” Taeb told Al Jazeera.
The advocacy group Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) was also quick to denounce the congressional measure.
“Falsely stating that anti-Zionism is antisemitism conflates all Jews with the Israeli state and endangers our communities. It fuels deadly violence and censorship campaigns against Palestinians,” JVP Action said in a social media post.
“We are proud anti-Zionists Jews. We refuse to pit communities against one another.”
We must be steadfast & clear in condemning antisemitism. The extreme GOP resolution on the floor today had no Democratic cosponsors & inappropriately said all anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Muddying the waters about what antisemitism is, is completely wrong and unhelpful.
— Rep. Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal)December 5, 2023

All House Republicans but one — Congressman Thomas Massie — voted in favour of the resolution. ButDemocrats weresplit on the measure: 13 voted against it and 95 for it, on top of the 92 who abstained with a “present” vote.
Jerrold Nadler, a key Jewish House Democrat, had decried the resolution on Monday, noting that some Jewish communities oppose Zionism for religious reasons and should not be branded as anti-Semitic.
“While most anti-Zionism is indeed anti-Semitic, the authors, if they were at all familiar with Jewish history and culture, should know about Jewish anti-Zionism that was, and is, expressly not anti-Semitic,” he said.
Nadler accused Republicans of using support for Israel to advance “partisan wedging at the expense of the Jewish community”. Still, he did not vote against the resolution on Tuesday. He opted for “present”.
The vote highlighted the divisions among the Democrats over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. While the party’sprogressive winghas pressed for a ceasefire, President Joe Biden and the majority of congressional Democrats have avoided such calls.
But that could signal a disconnect from the party base. AReuters/Ipsos pollin November indicated 62 percent of Democratic voters considered Israel’s response “excessive”. Two in three survey respondents backed a ceasefire.
I stand against islamophobia & antisemitism. However, a definition where anti-Zionism = antisemitism sets a dangerous precedent. I voted NO on this HRes894 because we can't conflate criticism of the Israeli gov & its extreme, xenophobic nationalist policies w antisemitism.
— Congresswoman Delia Ramirez (@repdeliaramirez)December 5, 2023

Republicans, meanwhile, have led motions that critics say are designed to bring the Democratic schism to the fore. Last month, for instance, they moved to censureCongresswoman Tlaib, the only Palestinian in the House, over her comments on the Gaza war.
Conservatives have accused Democrats who vote against such measures of being anti-Israel, if not anti-Semitic.
That creates a political dilemma for Democratic lawmakers. If they support the bills, they risk upsetting large segments of their base, but if they oppose them, they open themselves to Republican attacks.
Taeb said the lawmakers who voted “present” did not want to go on the record as equating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism, but at the same time, they wanted to be seen as countering anti-Semitism.
“It’s just politics,” she told Al Jazeera.
H.Res 894 exploits Jewish communities' pain for political points.
While it rightly denounces antisemitism, it equates all anti-Zionism as antisemitism — denying the vast complexity of Jewish communities — all of whom deserve safety.
And that's why I voted present.
— Congresswoman Madeleine Dean (@RepDean)December 5, 2023

Tuesday’s resolution was co-sponsored by CongressmanMax Miller, who has faced outrage in recent weeks for saying, “We’re going to turn [Palestine] into a parking lot.”
Taeb said the fact that lawmakers who have promoted anti-Palestinian hate are championing such resolutions shows that Tuesday’s measure is not about combating prejudice.
“The intent of these members is to smear and silence peace activists calling to end the massacre of Palestinian children and families.”

UN warns of ‘horror’ and ‘atrocities’ as Israel steps up Gaza assault | Gaza News | Al Jazeera,2023-12-06T13:39:00,AlJazeera,,"UN officials have warned that the risk of “atrocities” is growing in Gaza, with Palestinians stuck in “deepening horror” as Israel intensifies its assault on the enclave.
Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Volker Türk, UN high commissioner for human rights, urged Israel, Hamas, and international actors with influence to prevent “atrocity crimes” as Israel’s advance into southern Gaza leaves displaced Palestinians withnowhere to run.
“Palestinians in Gaza are living in utter deepening horror,” Türk continued, describing the displacement and the systemic deprivation of millions of Palestinians, who are surviving in unsafe, overcrowded and unsanitary conditions with no security.
“My colleagues describe the situation as ‘apocalyptic’. In these circumstances, there is a heightened risk of atrocity crimes,” he stated.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) echoed his words, warning that the situation in Gaza is “getting worse each minute”.
“Another wave of displacement is underway in Gaza”, UNRWA said in a post on X, labelling the enclave “one of the most dangerous places in the world”.
“There is no “safe” zone in#Gaza. The whole of the 📍#GazaStriphas become one of the most dangerous places in the world”@JulietteToumatells@BBCNewshow the situation ""is getting worse by the minute"" as we receive non stop SOS calls from friends and@UNRWAcolleagues.pic.twitter.com/jBpGOeCMpU
— UNRWA (@UNRWA)December 6, 2023


Speaking shortly before Human Rights Day on December 10, Türk noted that history has shown how a “cynical disregard” for human rights can lead to events that the world has declared should “never again” happen.
It also risks resulting in impunity, he added, calling for all allegations of war-time crimes against civilians and hostages committed by Israel or Hamas to be investigated.
Noting also the “alarming” escalation in “militarised violence” in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, Türk urged “the Israeli authorities [to] take immediate steps to end wide-spread impunity for such violations”.
The UN official noted unlawful killings, aggressive settler violence, increases in arbitrary detentions, ill-treatment, sexual violence, and an alarming spike in deaths in custody of Palestinians.
Allegations of sexual crimes committed by Hamas fighters during the October 7 attack on southern Israel must also be fully investigated “to ensure justice for the victims”, he continued.
“Violence and vengeance will only lead to more violence,” he said. “The only solution is to end the occupation and achieve a two-state solution.”
The International community must come together “with one voice”,  to demand a ceasefire immediately on humanitarian grounds.
At least 16,248 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its retaliation to Hamas’s assault on southern Israel on October 7, according to authorities in the enclave. In Israel, the official death toll stands at about 1,200.
This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted on December 10, 1948.
