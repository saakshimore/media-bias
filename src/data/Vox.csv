What happens if the peace process fails?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Israel, the West Bank, and potentially even Gaza could become a single de facto state.If the peace process fails, Israel, the West Bank, and potentially even Gaza could become a single de facto state, as it’s not clear how separate Israeli and Palestinian states could be established absent some kind of legal agreement to keep them distinct. That means one of two things: either Israel ceases to exist as a Jewish state, or the Palestinians become permanent second-class citizens in an Israel that includes the West Bank and potentially even Gaza.Arabs will eventually outnumber Jews in Israel-Palestine, if they don’t already. For Israel, which sees itself as both Jewish and democratic, this poses an existential crisis. If Arabs outnumber Jews and are allowed to vote, then it’s the end of a Jewish state. But if Arabs outnumber Jews and aren’t allowed to vote, then Israel is no longer a democracy.That’s the force of the South Africa analogy many commentators have used: a Jewish state that represses an Arab majority would feel an awful lot like a form of apartheid. The comparison is particularly troubling for Israelis, who are concerned about being boycotted and sanctioned in the international sphere in the way South Africa’s racial regime was before its demise.Israeli conservatives often contest these demographics. They argue that Palestinians overstate their numbers for political reasons and that the Israeli population tends to grow faster than experts think. However, the mainstream view is that Israel’s demographic problem is real, and Israel faces a choice between three outcomes: a two-state solution, a non-democratic state governed by a Jewish minority, or the end of a Jewish state.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The House censure of Rashida Tlaib, explained",2023-11-09,Vox,['Li Zhou'],"Filed under:The move follows bipartisan backlash over rhetoric Tlaib has used in response to the Israel-Hamas war. On Tuesday evening, the House voted to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), the only Palestinian American lawmaker in Congress, over the rhetoric she’s used in response to the Israel-Hamas war. The censure resolution, introduced by Rep. Rich McCormick (R-GA), accuses Tlaib of “promoting false narratives” about Hamas’s brutal October 7 attack on Israel and “calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.” One of the flashpoints was a slogan used in a video she shared on social media — calling for freedom “from the river to the sea” — which critics say calls for the abolition of Israel as a Jewish state and which advocates say calls for Palestinian freedom. Tlaib has said the resolution distorts her positions, attempts to police her speech, and is filled with “obvious lies.” “My criticism has always been of the Israeli government and Netanyahu’s actions. It is important to separate people and governments,” Tlaib said in a floor speech on Tuesday. “I can’t believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. We are human beings just like anyone else.”The resolution advanced 234-188, with the support of 212 Republicans and 22 Democrats; four Republicans and 184 Democrats voted against it. Censure is a serious disciplinary measure that’s available in the House, though it is less severe than other actions like expulsion. Censure is defined as “a formal statement of disapproval,” but in practice, it doesn’t have concrete consequences beyond offering a clear rebuke of the lawmaker it targets — one that’s permanently entered into congressional records. In some cases, the censured lawmaker must stand in the center of the House chamber while the reasons for their censure are read to them publicly, though this was not required in Tlaib’s case. Lawmakers do not lose any privileges as a result of censure unless otherwise specified.   Censures have previously been relatively rare, though they’ve increased in frequency in recent years and become more politicized. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) was also censured earlier this year for his role in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment and claims he made that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election. In 2021, House Democrats censured Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and removed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) from her committees for supporting posts that contained violence against Democrats. Some Democrats have argued that Republicans have been eager to censure Democrats this term to get revenge for the disciplinary action Gosar and Taylor Greene faced, and the role some lawmakers played in Trump investigations.  Progressive members have noted that Tlaib has been the subject of past Republican attacks and that she is the second Muslim American woman to be the subject of disciplinary action in the House this year. Previously, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) was removed from her assignment on the Foreign Affairs Committee over past rhetoric that some lawmakers described as antisemitic. That’s led some progressives to argue women of color are being targeted for disciplinary action, while white colleagues who make inflammatory statements are not. The resolution cites a couple of different reasons for censure, including statements she made in response to the October 7 attacks, comments she made regarding the bombing of al-Ahli hospital, and a video she posted requesting President Joe Biden call for a ceasefire. With respect to Hamas’s attack, the resolution claims Tlaib issued a statement that “defended the brutal rapes, murders, be-headings, and kidnapping—including of Americans—by Hamas as justified ‘resistance’ to the ‘apartheid state.’” In actuality, however, Tlaib’s statement is more nuanced than the resolution seems to suggest. She started by writing, “I grieve the Palestinian and Israeli lives lost yesterday, today and every day,” referring both to the Hamas attacks as well as the Israeli government’s bombardment of Gaza in retaliation. She continued on to voice criticisms of Israel’s longtime blockade of Gaza and occupation of Palestinian territories, and criticized what she and some human rights organizations have called the country’s practice of apartheid. She went on to say that these factors “[create] the suffocating, dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance,” though did not call that resistance “justified,” and denounced US funding for Israel’s actions, which the censure also highlighted as being problematic. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]The resolution also rebukes Tlaib for blaming Israel for the bombing of al-Ahli hospital on October 17. Hamas has blamed the Israeli military for the bombing, something the Israeli government denied. The US government says its intelligence has concluded with “high confidence” that Israel did not cause the bombing, though it was less certain what the source was. Independent investigations into the matter have been inconclusive, but publicly available evidence suggests the blast was caused by a rocket rather than an airstrike. Like many other officials, news outlets, and observers, in the hours after the bombing, Tlaib blamed Israel for the destruction. In her official statement a week later after more evidence and investigation, Tlaib wrote, “I cannot uncritically accept Israel’s denials of responsibility as fact, especially in light of confirmation from the World Health Organization that Israel has bombed numerous medical facilities in Gaza and reports from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society of ongoing threats from the Israeli military to evacuate hospitals.” She also argued that both the Israeli and US governments have misled the public in the past. Republicans and Democrats have criticized Tlaib for not apologizing for her initial October 17 post on the subject. Finally, the resolution condemns a video Tlaib posted meant to pressure Biden into calling for a ceasefire that contains a clip of protesters using the term “from the river to the sea.” The censure claims the phrase “is widely recognized as a genocidal call to violence to destroy the state of Israel and its people to replace it with a Palestinian state.” In a tweet sent along with the video, Tlaib wrote, “From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.”From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate. My work and advocacy is always centered in justice and dignity for all people no matter faith or ethnicity.There is some debate over the meaning of the phrase. Some pro-Israel advocacy groups including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee have said the phrase is antisemitic and that it calls for the elimination of Israel. The phrase, however, has also had different interpretations and applications. Some organizations that have explicitly called for violence against Jews and Israel’s destruction in the past — like Hamas — have used the phrase. Others who support Palestinian rights have also used it to call for freedom from oppression in the occupied Palestinian territories as well as peaceful coexistence. Some have used it to implicitly or explicitly call for a one-state solution, in which Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza would be merged into one democratic nation, ending Zionism, and under which all of the region’s inhabitants would live.As Vox’s Marin Cogan writes, it’s “a phrase many Jewish people have long understood as a call for the elimination of Jews from the region, but which supporters of the Palestinian liberation argue is meant to connote freedom for the Palestinians living under occupation.” The phrase has mid-20th century origins, and as Middle East historian Maha Nassar has explained, has its roots in the region’s anti-colonial movements. In recent decades, its usage and meaning have evolved, been weaponized, and been reclaimed. In recent protests, it’s been a common refrain at demonstrations calling for an Israeli ceasefire.Ultimately, Tlaib’s decision to include the phrase in her video led to her censure. While many lawmakers opposed an attempt to censure Tlaib last week, the use of the phrase “from the river to the sea” compelled more members to sign on this time, with both Republicans and Democrats criticizing Tlaib’s statements. “I will always defend the right to free speech. Tlaib has the right to say whatever she wants,” said Rep. Brad Schneider (D-IL), one of the 22 Democrats who voted for the censure. “But it cannot go unanswered.” The Democrats who signed on to the censure — including Schneider — have said they did so to express their concerns about the use of “from the river to the sea.” Others who did not back the censure, including Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), the only Jewish member of Michigan’s congressional delegation, have described the phrase as one of “division & violence” and spoken out against Tlaib’s use of it, but argued its use didn’t require censure. Since the censure doesn’t have direct practical consequences, the main purpose it serves is for Republicans and some Democrats to send a bipartisan message about their opposition to Tlaib’s rhetoric and reaffirm US support for the Israeli government. As experts previously told Vox, Republican-led censures are also a way for the party to rally its base and show GOP voters that it is holding Democrats accountable. In a series of speeches ahead of Tuesday’s censure vote, Tlaib’s progressive allies defended her, claiming that she — like Omar, the other Muslim American woman in Congress — has been unfairly targeted by Republicans, and the subject of racism, sexism, and xenophobia. Both have also been the subject of an uptick in death threats in the last few weeks as anti-Muslim sentiment has increased during the Israel-Hamas war, NBC News reports. It’s “another shameful, but predictable ploy of distraction from the real traffickers of hate, who are obsessed with policing progressive women of color,” said progressive Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Other Democrats said they disagreed with Tlaib’s statements but opposed the censure due to the implications it had for free speech. The chamber’s three Muslim American members, Tlaib, Omar, and Rep. André Carson (D-IN), also criticized the lack of condemnation of other members who have made comments that are anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, or anti-Palestinian. “Max Miller said Gaza was going to be ‘turned into a parking lot,’” they noted in a joint statement, referencing the Ohio lawmaker’s Fox News appearance in which he said Tlaib having the Palestinian flag outside her office was inappropriate because Palestine isn’t a state, “they’re a territory that’s probably about to get eviscerated and go away shortly, because we’re going to turn that into a parking lot.” The trio of lawmakers also critiqued statements Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL) has made conflating Palestinian militants and civilians, and a bill from Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT) that would bar immigration from people holding Palestinian Authority passports. They argue that such bills and rhetoric could fuel further anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiment as people in the US and elsewhere fear an uptick in hate crimes. As Vox’s Fabiola Cineas has explained, there have been concerns across the US about a rise in antisemitism as well as in anti-Muslim sentiment as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Update, November 10, 11:15 am ET: This piece was originally published on November 9 and has been updated to reflect the pro-Israel advocacy work of groups including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee.

The pandemic hasn’t stopped Native Hawaiians’ fight to protect Maunakea,2020-08-07,Vox,['Frances Nguyen'],"Filed under:Despite the pandemic, protectors are still working to prevent the construction of a massive telescope.“It almost seems like it never happened,” Pua Case tells Vox about her time in the encampment at the foot of Maunakea, a dormant volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii and the tallest mountain in the world. While she lives only a 30-minute drive away, she says, “I have to go back and look at videos or pictures to remind myself that we were really up there.”For nearly nine months, she and other kiaʻi, or protectors, were sleeping in a parking lot over a lava field that marks the beginning of the access road up to Maunakea’s summit. From the Pu‘uhonua o Pu‘uhuluhulu camp, protectors kept watch for construction crews for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) — planned to be the largest telescope in the Northern Hemisphere — through windstorms, hail, and overnight temperatures that dipped well below 30 degrees Fahrenheit. In Hawaiian traditions of creation, the mountain is an ancestor and shares genealogical ties with Native Hawaiians, or Kanaka Maoli. It is one of the most sacred sites — if not the most sacred — in Hawaiian culture. For kiaʻi, protecting the mountain from desecration is more than a cultural responsibility; it’s a lineal duty to those who came before them and the generations who will succeed them.When the pandemic hit, kiaʻi were already assessing the threat of construction and considering the impact on resources. After determining that there was no imminent threat, they decided to pack up their site, which hosted anywhere between 30 and 3,000 people at any given time. Should an attempt be made to initiate the project, they knew they could be back up there in half an hour. Still, their departure from the mountain was marked by emotional exhaustion and trepidation for what was to come.It also presented familiar challenges. Before the latest standoff on the mountain, many kiaʻi had spent years tirelessly writing letters, submitting testimony to city council meetings, combing over management plans, and trying to monitor the movements of multiple parties with vastly more power and resources than they’ll ever have. Today, they continue that labor from their homes.At least on the mountain, they could offer their physical presence to inspire supporters, who could be shielded from the invisible — and, certainly, less romantic — work kiaʻi had been doing behind the scenes. The movement has a robust social media presence that acts as a direct line of communication between the front line and its supporters abroad. The Protect Mauna a Wākea Instagram account, one of two accounts that had been operating from the camp, has 136,000 followers who rely on photos and videos of kiaʻi to draw inspiration and feel plugged into the action. Under lockdown, the movement is challenged with keeping supporters, who are used to seeing dispatches from the mountain, engaged and connected to it. “It’s constant,” Case says. “You have to be a presence or you’re going to disappear. And you can’t afford to disappear when you’re talking about your lifeways, your culture, and the very continuance and protection of the places that are connected to you.”Kiaʻi have opposed the telescope’s construction in a string of legal challenges, petitions, and protests over the past decade. But the fight for Maunakea gained national attention a year ago, after Hawaii Gov. David Ige announced that construction would be cleared to begin on July 15. That morning, kiaʻi awaited the construction crews. Some had locked themselves to a cattle guard that was built into the Mauna Kea Access Road — the only road up to the summit. But then, a line of elders, or kupuna, formed farther down, at the start of the road. It was their blockade that inevitably became the front line.“I saw them sitting in lawn chairs and folding chairs on the road, all bundled up with blankets and sleeping bags,” said Andre Perez, one of the kiaʻi and a nonviolent direct action trainer for the Hawaiʻi Unity and Liberation Institute. He was the acting police liaison that day. “I knew that something powerful was happening. The elders were stepping into the fray and taking charge.” They held that line for two days before Ige issued a state of emergency on July 17, clearing a path for law enforcement to begin making arrests. Multiple agencies arrived on the scene; there were officers brought in from other islands, three state agencies, and the National Guard. It wasn’t long before kiaʻi, hundreds of whom had gathered there around their kupuna, were sitting in front of a massive militarized police presence dressed in riot gear and armed with chemical dispersants and a long-range acoustic device (LRAD) — a sonic weapon developed for use by the US military that emits high-frequency sounds at extreme volumes to disperse crowds.Whatever aggression law enforcement expected from the crowd that day never materialized. Kia‘i sat in purposeful silence as 38 of their kupuna, many in their 70s and 80s, were arrested and escorted — and, in several instances, carried — away to awaiting police vans, crying but resolute. The air above the crowd was periodically punctured by sobs, singing, and chanting. “We didn’t want to give the police any reason to escalate,” said Perez. “Our discipline was our safety.” Images and video footage of the arrests sparked public outcry across the island chain and overseas. It was the stark, visible disparity between the resistance and the state response that galvanized a native movement and brought supporters from around the world to their cause. For nearly nine months after, kupuna never left the spot they first occupied. A tent was erected to shelter them as they sat on the road, and a volunteer village formed overnight, equipped with a kitchen, solar trailers, and even a “university” grounded in Native Hawaiian science and culture. They hosted locals and musicians from neighboring islands, curious tourists, relatives from other Indigenous movements — the camp flew flags gifted to them from Palestine, Tibet, Guam, Standing Rock, Cherokee, and Navajo, Aotearoa, and the Indigenous Australian people, among others. Even Hollywood celebrities like Jason Momoa and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who felt connected to the movement through their Polynesian heritage, came to pay their respects. A team of medics was also on hand to assist kupuna, some of whom experienced altitude sickness and even mild strokes while keeping watch over their sacred mountain. Many kupuna had preexisting health conditions that made their taking a stand challenging — and yet, they stayed. After five months and $15 million spent on officers and supplies to manage the conflict, Ige withdrew state and county law enforcement from the mountain. At the same time, he requested additional funding from the House Finance Committee as a “contingency amount for any upcoming projects that may attract community activism, including but not limited to Maunakea.” In late December, kiaʻi reached a temporary agreement with Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim to clear the access road with his assurance that TMT would not attempt to begin construction until the end of February 2020. They caught a break when the deal expired; the observatory’s leadership had yet to determine when construction could begin.In the midst of the pandemic, the future is uncertain. Kiaʻi don’t know when or if they’ll return to the mountain to resume their standoff. Since the lockdown, some have returned to the mountain to stand at the ahu, the altar erected alongside where their camp once stood, and for years where many have offered prayers. It is ground that they hope someday to only have to hold in prayer, rather than resistance. The new giant telescope promises access to “the very edge of the observable Universe,” an opportunity to discover places that were previously unreachable to humankind. “It will enable a new frontier of discoveries about the contents, nature, and evolution of the universe, including the search for life on other planets,” the University of California, one of the project’s funders, said in a statement to Vox. “The potential for scientific discoveries is truly unlimited.”But kiaʻi say it’s precisely this argument that gives cause for opposition: There are some places that humans aren’t meant to go, and the summit of Maunakea is one of them. The summit is firmly the province of the gods. Historically, only select individuals — such as the kahuna, or priests, or the ali‘i, high chiefs — were permitted on the mountain in order to perform ceremonies of affairs, and they wouldn’t stay long. It is sacred not only in its religious capacity but also because of the lack of oxygen. At 13,796 feet, there is 40 percent less air pressure at the summit than at sea level. Visitors are advised to heed signs of altitude sickness and pulmonary and cerebral edemas. Even employees at existing observatories have reported feeling fatigued working at that elevation. “It’s a place where humans don’t belong,” says Noe Noe Wong-Wilson, one of the kupuna arrested that day. “Where gods reside.”The area between Maunakea, Mauna Loa, and Hualālai volcanic mountains are sensitive environments and culturally significant landscapes. Roughly 20 miles from Kona to the west and almost 30 miles from Hilo to the east, the area is extremely remote. The only other substantial activity in that area is at the Pōhakuloa Training Area, the largest military installation in the Pacific, where the US Army conducts live-fire training a few miles down the road. On those rare nights when the harsh weather conditions would relent, kiaʻi still had to fall asleep to the sound of machine gun fire carried over the camp by an eastward wind. And as they laid their heads down in their tents, they could feel tremors underneath them from the impact of explosions. “It feels like a little earthquake,” says Wong-Wilson. “Every time, it just hurt our soul.”TMT proponents say they don’t understand why Kanaka and locals would go through the trouble to contest a telescope, an instrument of science that beckons humankind to reach for a higher purpose. Many have reasoned that the telescope must represent other longstanding issues for the Hawaiian people — such as the 1893 illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom by American and European businessmen, aided by the US military, which paved the way for US possession of the islands and, eventually, Hawaii’s induction into statehood. “I understand that talking about TMT is a way to express some frustration over these issues that have not been addressed in the past,” Gordon Squires, vice president of external affairs for the TMT International Observatory, told Hawaii News Now.It’s a position those in the movement have heard repeatedly from their opposition, and to Kamanamaikalani Beamer, a longtime advocate for the preservation of Maunakea and an associate professor at the University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa’s School of Law and School of Hawaiian Knowledge, the argument is entirely dismissive. “Trying to say, ‘Look, we’re sorry [about] the overthrow, but don’t make us hurt for it’ is so dislocated from the reality of the situation. The scale, the amount of degradation, and the density of the existing telescope facilities on Maunakea — it’s all too much.” Squires, meanwhile, has called the project — whose budget has now climbed from its initial projection of $1.4 billion to $2.4 billion — “a bargain for the people of Hawaii and the people of the world as we understand our place in the universe.” But what many onlookers find perplexing, and what opponents of the telescope certainly find frustrating, is that TMT already has the licenses and land required to develop on a backup site: La Palma in Spain’s Canary Islands. It is a far less contentious option, and yet Maunakea remains TMT’s first choice for the project; the summit’s higher altitude and cooler temperatures make it a “slightly better” site to capture infrared light, Harvard’s astronomy department chair, Avi Loeb, told the Associated Press, thereby enhancing the telescope’s imaging capabilities.“I think we can all agree that Maunakea is a great place to view the stars,” says Beamer. “But that’s not all Maunakea is.”TMT leadership and proponents have also vehemently denied that the project’s presence would disturb any cultural resources or sites at the summit. But historical mismanagement of the summit’s natural and cultural resources has been well documented since the first observatory was constructed; kia‘i have no doubt that the addition of an 18-story building — slated to be the largest building on the Big Island — will be any different.“In the Western perspective, people want to draw a line in the dirt and say, ‘It’s only sacred in this spot here, where you stand; therefore, we can build 500 feet to the left of that because that’s not sacred anymore.’ And we say that the landscape of the summit, which has no line drawn around it, is a spiritual landscape,” says Wong-Wilson. “Once they dig two stories into the ground and put in all the roads and outbuildings, and then the five-acre structure, they’ll have done damage that’s irreparable. The way that it looks now will never be recovered, and that, to me, is unacceptable. All the money in the world will not make up for that.” There’s no telling what the fight ahead looks like for the movement, other than that it will be difficult. While the TMT International Observatory has announced that construction will not likely begin until 2021, the project is pursuing significant funding from the National Science Foundation, which would present a new set of federal regulatory obstacles that could further postpone construction by at least another three years. Still, Squires says it isn’t a question of “if” construction would happen, but “when.” “We’re absolutely committed to finding a way forward in Hawaii,” he said to Hawaii News Now on July 15, exactly one year since the most recent standoff began. The University of California also doubled down on its commitment to the project, saying, “TMT remains committed to integrating science and culture, providing the best possible stewardship of Maunakea, enriching Hawaiian culture and heritage, and supporting educational opportunities as it enables this global scientific collaboration centered in Hawaii in the interest of humanity.”The governor’s office did not respond to Vox about the state’s involvement in the private project’s progress in the future. But in February, Ige traveled to Japan — one of two countries investing public funds into the project — and met with key TMT stakeholders there, signaling his commitment, as he stated in his emergency proclamation a year ago, “to seeing this project through.” As far as kiaʻi are concerned, though, they still have a job to do: protect the mountain; stop the project for good. In July, to commemorate a year since this latest standoff and the kupuna arrests, a slew of online events and actions was organized for their supporters to participate in “#TMTshutdown week,” including topic-focused talks via Zoom, film screenings, and a letter-signing campaign to TMT’s board of governors, project partners, and other affiliated stakeholders urging them to halt any further attempts at construction. Kiaʻi also recently submitted testimony at a UC Board of Regents meeting on July 30, where its chair John Pérez concluded that the board would continue discussions of the telescope at a later date. Meanwhile, charges against the 38 kupuna still stand.While kiaʻi can’t afford rest, they might spare a moment to marvel at what has transpired over the past year. “I think most people thought we would get squashed. We were up against a billion-dollar project,” says Beamer. “And yet we were able to turn the tide. Despite all that it takes to stand against something like this, to risk what we’ve spent our lives building, people did it anyway. And we did it out of courage.” On July 15, 2019, construction for TMT was scheduled to begin. One year later, it still hasn’t broken ground.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What is the Palestinian Liberation Organization? How about Fatah and the Palestinian Authority?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:It’s the national representative of the Palestinian people (nominally), and runs the government in the West Bank but not in Gaza.The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) is the national representative of the Palestinian people. It runs the Palestinian National Authority (PA), the semi-autonomous government tasked with managing the Palestinian territories until it makes a deal with Israel. Fatah, the secular nationalist political party that’s dominated Palestinian politics for decades, controls the PLO and PA.In practice, the PLO runs the government in the West Bank but not in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas. It also conducts peace talks on behalf of the Palestinians, but its authority to implement those deals has in the past been hampered by poor relations with Hamas.In the first decades after its 1964 creation, the PLO sought to destroy Israel and replace it with an entirely Palestinian state. Fatah’s founder, Yasser Arafat, employed military tactics toward this end, including attacks on Israeli civilians. This changed in 1993, when the PLO accepted Israel’s right to exist in exchange for Israel recognizing it as the legitimate representative of Palestinians. That was the beginning of real peace negotiations between the two sides.The PLO’s current chair is the relatively moderate Mahmoud Abbas, whose opposition to violence played a role in de-escalating the second intifada. Frustrated by the failure of peace talks, particularly Secretary of State John Kerry’s push in 2013 and early 2014, Abbas is also pursuing international recognition of Palestinian statehood. As a result, Palestine now has non-member state status at the UN; it also joined the International Criminal Court on April 1, 2015.The statehood push is meant to put pressure on Israel. The US opposes it.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."

Netanyahu wins big in Israel’s elections — but not enough to secure full control,2020-03-04,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Israel’s confusing election results, and why they matter, explained.The third Israeli election in less than a year has delivered a third inconclusive result. After two days of tense vote counting, results show neither incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor his leading rival Benny Gantz winning enough support to command a clear parliamentary majority. Yet Netanyahu’s right-wing side won more votes by a surprisingly large margin, despite the fact that he had been recently indicted on corruption-related charges. As such, Netanyahu is now in a much stronger position than Gantz is to put together a parliamentary coalition.Winning a majority in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, requires control of 61 seats. Early estimates from Israeli election officials show Netanyahu’s Likud and other right-wing parties winning 58 seats, while Gantz’s Blue and White and other parties on the broader center-left win 55.That obviously makes it easier for Netanyahu to form a government. One option for him forming an alliance with a faction of Blue and White that breaks with the party’s anti-Netanyahu position. Another is partnering with a party that splits Israel’s political divides down the middle, and could give either Netanyahu or Gantz a majority: Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home) party. Lieberman’s party aligns with the right on security issues and policy toward the Palestinians, but aligns with the left on issues related to the relationship between synagogue and state. In the past two elections, Lieberman has thus far been unwilling to back either a right-wing Netanyahu government or a center-left Gantz coalition — the former because it would require working with ultra-Orthodox parties, the latter because it would require working with Arab parties. But it’s possible that after months of political deadlock, and an unprecedented three elections in a row, Lieberman might finally get over his objections and pick a side — most likely Netanyahu’s, given the right’s strong results. If Netanyahu does cobble together a majority, the consequences could be extraordinarily significant. He’s promised to take the Israel-Palestine conflict into a dangerous new stage — and his push to protect himself from prosecution could end up doing serious damage to Israeli democracy.This third-straight inconclusive result isn’t all that surprising to observers of Israeli politics. For a while, it appeared that Israeli public opinion had largely ossified, with people committed to particular camps and unwilling to change their minds.But Netanyahu’s surprisingly strong performance this time around shows that a “largely” ossified public is not a fully ossified one; his improvement relative to the September elections puts him much closer to commanding a majority.The parties will now go into coalition bargaining to try to come up with a scenario in which one of the two major parties can cobble together 61 votes in the Knesset for their government. In theory, there could be some kind of compromise government in which Gantz and Netanyahu share power, perhaps with the former as a high-level cabinet minister while the latter serves as prime minister. But this has been politically impossible in the past. Netanyahu would almost demand his partners support some version of a law protecting him from prosecution and imprisonment (at least while in office). Gantz has ruled out doing so, and focused much of his campaign on Netanyahu’s corruption. This could be solved if Netanyahu were replaced as leader of Likud, but he defeated a recent primary challenge decisively and, after this strong election performance, has most likely cemented his control over Likud.The intractability of these decisions has so far produced a weak caretaker government, with Netanyahu hanging on as prime minister but lacking enough legislative support to enact major changes. But while Israeli politics have stood still, the context surrounding them has changed a lot — ratcheting up the stakes at a time when Israeli voters couldn’t make up their minds.One major development has been the Trump administration’s long-awaited peace plan. The “Deal of the Century” was heavily weighted to Israeli interests, allowing it to annex so much land in the West Bank that the Palestinians would be left without anything like a viable state. The wording of the document seemed to suggest that Israel could begin seizing this land even if the Palestinians never agreed to the deal’s framework — and just a day before Monday’s election, Netanyahu vowed to quickly annex the land if reelected.Annexation “will happen within weeks, two months at the most, I hope,” he said in an interview with Israeli public television. While Gantz has signaled support for annexing part of the West Bank in theory, it would be unlikely to happen if he took power with the backing of center-left parties that fundamentally oppose the idea. That’s because, if it were to happen, it could force Israel down one of two unacceptable paths. Option one would be to give the vote to Palestinians and make them full citizens of Israel, leading to an Arab demographic majority and thus ending Israel’s status as a Jewish state. This is not only a recipe for violence between Muslims and Jews but also unacceptable to Israel’s political, who care much more about the state’s Jewish character than its democratic one. Option two is indefinite Israeli rule over Palestinians without granting them citizenship. There’s a word for keeping an ethnically defined part of your population in permanent second-class citizenship: apartheid.So long as Israel is in political deadlock, the choice on whether to head toward such outcomes is basically on hold. If Netanyahu can’t win over a defector from another party and Lieberman continues to stay on the sidelines, Israelis and Palestinians won’t know whether they’ll hurtle closer to an existential crisis produced by Netanyahu’s annexations — or step back from the brink (most likely) under Gantz.The second big change has been Netanyahu’s formal indictment in November, a decision that dramatizes just how serious a threat Netanyahu’s continued premiership poses to Israeli democracy.The charges are serious, relating to three cases of financial and political misconduct, and carry the possibility of jail time. His offenses include allegedly attempting to trade political and regulatory favors for favorable coverage in two outlets, the leading daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth (Latest News) and the popular news website Walla. He seems to have succeeded with Walla, allegedly reaching a secret deal to approve a merger that its parent company wanted in exchange for favorable coverage. Using economic powers to bend the media to your will is a hallmark of authoritarian states, and reflects the many different ways that Israeli democracy has degenerated since Netanyahu’s current time in office began way back in 2009. His government has worked to marginalize Arab citizens, implicitly slotting them into second-class citizenship by passing a bill formally defining Israel as a state for its Jewish citizens. It has launched an attack on the court system, working to undermine the separation of powers. It has cultivated allies in the private sector, NGOs, and the right-wing press (funded by in part by wealthy Americans) that aim to stifle and delegitimize dissent. If Netanyahu figures out a way to gain control of the government, he’ll almost certainly work to immunize himself from prosecution — likely by passing the aforementioned law giving himself retroactive immunity (at least while in office). Gantz, by contrast, has vowed to challenge Netanyahu’s corrupt use of the top office.“I want to ask you tonight: What would you say a few years ago if I told you we would have a prime minister with three indictments — for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust — who will drag the state into three election campaigns to escape trial? Would you believe it?” he said in one campaign speech. “If I told you all these things five years ago, you would tell me it sounded like a fiction script; that there is no chance that this could ever happen in Israel — that’s [Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan. But this is the State of Israel in 2020,” he said.In Israel’s democracy, the choice is very clear: Netanyahu’s slide toward authoritarian rule, or a new course. Based on these results, it seems like voters are more comfortable with the former than many might have thought.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
How the Women’s March made itself indispensable,2018-01-19,Vox,['Anna North'],"Filed under:Over the past year, the march has become a crucial hub for left-wing organizations, and a potent political force for 2018.Francesca Dulce Larson and Shadawn Smith met at the Women’s Convention in October. The convention, in Detroit, was organized by the team behind the Women’s March in January with the goal of bringing women around the country back together to coordinate activism and political action for 2018 and beyond. That meant speeches by female activists and politicians, panel discussions, and, sometimes, impromptu conversations. Smith and Larson arrived at one session to find out the speaker hadn’t shown up. “So a group of us just formed a circle, everybody stayed, and we had a frank conversation about race,” Larson said. She said the purpose of the convention was to act like the center of a maze: “There’s a lot of entrances out of the center, and each one of those are the different issues that we’re tackling, and so we all kind of run in the different directions outside, and that means our voice is in more spaces.”It was an apt description of what the Women’s March has become since January 21, 2017, the day after President Trump’s inauguration. From an event bringing together more than 2 million people around the world, it’s grown into a movement — or, perhaps more accurately, a hub for a variety of movements. Over the past year, the organizers of the original march have taken a broad-based approach, putting together events in partnership with groups focusing on racial justice, disability, and LGBTQ rights, to name a few. The result is less a unified front than a collection of organizations and individuals working for gender equality and social justice in their own ways. Sometimes that structure can lead to division, as groups with different priorities or strategies chafe against one another. But it’s also allowed the influence of the march to persist and grow. A year out, the voices of marchers are in more spaces than ever — in voter registration drives, in conversations about #MeToo and sexual harassment, and in political campaigns across the country, as women gear up to run for office in record numbers. And those voices, taken together, are a potent force in American politics in the Trump era.After the marches last January in Washington, DC, and around the world drew enormous crowds — and reportedly angered the new president — the organizers of the Washington march stayed busy. Tamika Mallory, Linda Sarsour, Carmen Perez, and Bob Bland, along with others, planned the convention in Detroit in October, where more than 4,000 people heard speakers such as Me Too campaign founder Tarana Burke and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and participated in panels and training sessions on topics like running for office and confronting racism. This Sunday, on the one-year anniversary of the first march, the organizers will hold another big event, the kickoff of a nationwide voter registration initiative called #PowerToThePolls. Hosted in Las Vegas, the event will feature speakers like Alicia Garza, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter, and Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, as well as a video message from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). It will also launch a multi-state tour during which Women’s March organizers hope to register 1 million voters.In addition to the Las Vegas rally, marches around the country are planned for Saturday, January 20. Some of these events, held in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and many more cities, are directly affiliated with the national Women’s March organization, and some are not. Information on many of the marches is available on the #PowerToThePolls website.This year’s voter registration drive is emblematic of the march’s growth from a single protest into a force in electoral politics. This growth started early — EMILY’s List, which works on behalf of pro-choice Democratic female candidates, held a training session the day after the 2017 march for women interested in running for office. Around 500 women attended that day, and more than 26,000 women in total have reached out to EMILY’s List about running since the presidential election in November, more than 20 times the number the group usually sees in that period of time. “We saw a sort of coalescing moment” around women’s activism, said Muthoni Wambu Kraal, the vice president of national outreach and training at EMILY’s List. “The Women’s March was an incredibly important part of that coalescing moment.” But it wasn’t the only part. Around the time the march was being planned, EMILY’s List staffers noticed that more than 1,000 women had signed up for training through the group’s website after the election, Kraal said. The women were reaching out of their own volition, without any promotion on the group’s part (the link to sign up was on “a sleepy little part of our website,” Kraal said). That spike in signups led EMILY’s List to organize the event after the march. To some degree, both the march and subsequent candidate training sessions — Kraal led one in Detroit in October as well — harnessed enthusiasm that was already there, looking for an outlet.That enthusiasm was on display in November 2017, when female candidates posted historic victories. A record number of women were elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, including the state’s first Latina, openly transgender, and Asian-American female delegates. Ashley Bennett, who had never run for office before, decided to run for the Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders after a male member made fun of the Women’s March; she ended up winning his seat.Lawmakers who attended the Women’s March have also taken its energy back to their states. Teresa Fedor, chair of the Democratic women’s caucus in the Ohio House of Representatives, was at the march in Washington last year with other Ohio women. Since then, she’s been working on a bill to improve protections for people reporting sexual harassment in Ohio, and she will be marching on Saturday in Toledo.For Fedor, the Women’s March has helped change the way ordinary people talk about political action. “Even two years ago, it wasn’t cool to talk about politics or politicians,” she said. “We’ve transitioned into the realization that we make the difference.”Now, the Women’s March and its partners have their sights set on the midterm elections, in which Democrats hope to retake the US House of Representatives. EMILY’s List has already trained more than 2,400 women for the 2018 election cycle, and has endorsed a number of female congressional candidates in currently Republican-held districts, including Sara Jacobs in California and Gina Ortiz Jones in Texas.The Women’s March has been “a really powerful convener of women around the country and around the world,” Kraal said, an apt description for a group whose influence has come, in large part, from its ability to bring together other groups.Though the march last January was criticized by some for focusing on the needs and feelings of white women, the organizers have made clear that they view issues like racial and economic justice as part of their cause. The Women’s March is committed to “taking down the silos between issue areas, between identities, encouraging folks to organize together for a better impact,” said Bland, one of the organizers. The group has worked with organizations from Black Lives Matter to the immigrant youth organization United We Dream to Our Revolution, the national political organization that grew out of Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign. The Women’s March has been especially effective at coalition building, Bland said, giving people around the country “a reason to come together, when otherwise they might be doing work in parallel and not communicating with each other.”That coalition-building power has been evident at events like the Day Without a Woman strike in March and the March to Confront White Supremacy in September (which the Women’s March organized along with Color for Change, the Movement for Black Lives, and other groups). It’s clear on the march’s social media channels, which the organization uses to promote a variety of gender equality and other social justice causes and groups. Recent tweets have highlighted United We Dream’s push to pass a clean Dream Act and the Time’s Up campaign started by actresses and others to combat sexual harassment.The Women’s Convention, which Bland described as “the largest women’s convention of its kind in over 40 years,” was another opportunity to bring people and their concerns together. For people at work on different types of activism, gatherings like the convention offer a sense “that we’re all in this together,” Smith, the convention attendee, said in October. “We’re not alone, chipping away at the ice block.”“What I really have gotten out of the women’s movement is the common ground among women in all different scenarios across the United States,” said Larson when I caught up with her on Friday. Larson, who is from New Jersey, marched in Washington last January before attending the convention in October to speak on a panel about the campaign to put a woman on the $20 bill. “I don’t think I felt as strong connection to a woman in Kansas before as I do now,” she said.As is perhaps inevitable with any group that aims to bring together so many people, the Women’s March has faced conflicts from the beginning. In addition to concerns about the inclusion of women of color, the march last January drew criticism from women with anti-abortion views who felt excluded. Women with anti-choice views were not barred from marching, but an anti-choice group was removed from the march partners list, and the Women’s March “unity principles” include support for legal abortion. In March, some women who identify as Zionists objected to a call for the “decolonization of Palestine” in the women’s strike platform. Now there are disagreements about tactics between the Women’s March and a group called March On, founded by women who organized sister marches outside Washington last year, according to Farah Stockman at the New York Times. Some March On leaders believe protests organized by the Women’s March aren’t as effective in red states, and the group has launched its own voter registration and education effort, called March On the Polls. The Women’s March and March On have had some disagreements over branding, according to Stockman, with Women’s March leaders asking March On not to advertise their events as “Women’s March” actions. But the groups have not criticized one another directly, and, as sociologist Jo Reger told the Times, divisions like this are par for the course in the history of feminism.“We think it looks so chaotic and full of factions and what it really looks like is every other social movement,” Reger said. “Often those factions end up coming back together later on.”It’s not clear yet how the Women’s March coalition will evolve. But the organizers, their partners, and individual marchers are looking forward to 2018 with excitement. Silver State Voices, an organizing hub for voter registration groups and other grassroots organizations in Nevada, is gearing up for the rally on Sunday, said Emily Zamora, the group’s executive director. Organizers will arrive at the event around 8 am and spend the day registering new voters and helping others update their voter registration. After Silver State Voices registers women on Sunday, “our organization will continue to be in contact with them, and engage them throughout the election cycle and beyond,” Zamora said.Larson, for her part, plans to march on Saturday in Morristown, New Jersey, with her mother, who is currently being treated for lung cancer. Her hopes for the coming year center on her mom’s experiences: “When she walks in and gets to speak with a doctor, I want that doctor to listen to her and see her as a human who has just as much intelligence as he does.” “I want her to receive the same respect and belief that what she’s saying is true that other patients receive,” she added. “I think those moments are where lives are changed.”Larson has kept in touch with Smith since they met in October. Over drinks that started at happy hour and stretched into the evening, they continued the conversation they started at the convention, Larson said.In October, Smith was hopeful that the movement the Women’s March represents would have a real impact on the country. “I’m not optimistic about a lot of things at this moment,” she said, “but I am optimistic about that.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The thread that ties the recent chemical spills together,2023-04-02,Vox,['Rebecca Leber'],"Filed under:The growing oil and gas industry means more incidents like East Palestine.There’s a common thread linking many of the high-profile chemical spills that have made headlines across the country lately: the oil and gas industry. Philadelphia residents were on high alert after the Trinseo latex plant 20 miles from the city released at least 8,100 gallons of acrylic polymers into a tributary for the Delaware River on March 24. Those acrylic polymers were made up of compounds known as butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate; all are produced from fossil fuels. Last month, East Palestine, Ohio, faced a Norfolk Southern train derailment with highly volatile toxic chemicals, including butyl acrylate and vinyl chloride — which is also derived from oil. On March 28, 10 barges, including one containing 1,400 metric tons of methanol — yup, you guessed it, made from oil or gas — broke loose in the Ohio River in Kentucky. Many other incidents don’t make national news: The Guardian reported that the US has averaged a chemical accident every two days so far in 2023. Every year, there’s an average of 202 accidental chemical releases at facilities, according to EPA data. This adds up to a major threat to water quality. “In the US, chemical exposure probably is the biggest threat to water quality, particularly drinking water quality, whether that is direct chemical exposure from facilities like what happened in Philadelphia or chemical exposure from products,” said Joel Tickner, who is a professor of public health at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and leads the nonprofit Green Chemistry & Commerce Council. All these events are usually lumped together in the vague category of a chemical spill, but it’s important to get more specific than that. Petrochemicals — as this class of compounds are known — are ubiquitous today, used to make some form of the plastic found in detergents, cosmetics, clothing, packaging, and more. (The Trinseo plant near Philadelphia, for instance, was basically making paint.)There’s a reason plastics and petrochemicals are in nearly everything. They’re dirt cheap — and useful. The industry has become extremely efficient at converting fossil fuels into sets of materials that are lighter in weight and pliable, making them as adaptable for medical equipment as they are for lip balm, nail polish, clothing, and single-use coffee cups.But the adaptability comes at a cost. These chemicals can conceivably be produced and transported safely — at least on paper. But the volume of accidents shows how often they aren’t. In 2022, according to federal data, there were more than 20,000 recorded times hazardous materials caused injury, accidents, or death while in transit. “It’s a very risky chain every step of the way,” said Judith Enck, a former regional EPA administrator and president of the advocacy group Beyond Plastics.Those risks aren’t going away anytime soon. Petrochemical production in the US is booming, derived from the larger boom in US oil and gas supply. And the industry’s broadening footprint means more communities are coming in direct contact with carcinogens and endocrine-disruptors that affect humans and animals in ways scientists still don’t fully understand. Most of the time, people aren’t coming into contact with petrochemicals through train derailments, but in more mundane ways.The final form of plastic you buy at the store may be relatively harmless, but the building blocks it’s made up of are often hazardous to human and animal health. “Oil and gas is the basis of most of our chemistry,” Tickner said. “We built most of our modern chemistry on these seven fairly toxic, challenging chemicals and then you essentially iterate off of those.”Those seven basic chemicals are methanol, ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene, toluene, and xylene, and they can pose a variety of risks. Benzene, for instance, is a known carcinogen. Eventually, benzene may be transformed into something as benign as food packaging, but “that plastic that you have bought has a history somewhere else,” Tickner said. The manufacturing “might go back to a community in Louisiana that is highly exposed to benzene or ethylene oxide or some other material.”  There are more than 11,000 facilities that store, use, or handle hazardous materials in the US, according to the Government Accountability Office. But they tend to be concentrated in a few parts of the country, often in or near communities of color. Louisiana, the Ohio River Valley, and Texas have all seen expansion of petrochemical plants. The map below from Oil and Gas Watch shows the zoomed-out landscape for proposed and operating petrochemical facilities (yellow dots) and their pipelines (yellow lines) across the US: It’s cheap oil and gas that has helped fuel the rise in chemicals manufacturing. Traditionally, most plastics have come from imported petroleum, but fracking and expanded drilling have given rise to a domestic petrochemicals industry. The 2010s were a decade of historically low natural gas prices, and the cheap fuel made plastics an even more attractive proposition. These chemicals are produced in a variety of ways, but today the biggest proposed expansion in the US is in ethane cracker plants. These are facilities that use high heat capable of breaking (or “cracking”) the bonds in natural gas’s methane to produce ethane. That ethane is then used to create a huge array of plastics. One of the products that come from cracking ethylene is vinyl chloride, the same chemical that the derailed train carried in East Palestine. It’s transported as a chilled liquid, but when exposed to the outdoors it becomes a highly explosive gas. The risk of an uncontrolled explosion led responders in East Palestine to vent the vinyl chloride and burn it, producing a black cloud of smoke over the town of 4,700. Residents now worry that the fallout from the smoke will lead to contaminated groundwater in the years to come. Carnegie Mellon professor of green chemistry Terry Collins noted that the steady rise in petrochemicals nationwide is making it increasingly difficult to keep drinking water safe. Some plastics and petrochemicals mimic hormone molecules found in our bodies and can therefore interrupt growth and development, especially in children. “We’ve got this going on galore,” Collins said. As the East Palestine incident highlighted, there’s no completely foolproof way to process and transport these highly flammable and corrosive chemicals. Trains can derail, and pipelines can rupture. But controlled burns, like the one in East Palestine, happen regularly at petrochemicals plants. Rachel Meyer, an Ohio River Valley field coordinator for the environmental advocacy group Moms Clean Air Force, has seen just how common it is for a facility to flare its chemicals to avoid any fires or explosions. She lives at the center of fracking operations and petrochemical plants in southwestern Pennsylvania. She is 20 miles from the Norfolk Southern derailment but also a few miles from a giant new plastics plant, Shell’s Monaca facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. The giant Shell Monaca plant is less than six months old and, last month, the plant responded to malfunctioning equipment by flaring gas to avoid explosion. “It was so bright at nighttime,” Meyer said. “It was this reddish orange color. And I could see that on clouds all the way out where I am.” Residents have seen that glow from 17 miles away.  Environmental Integrity Project, a watchdog environmental group, notes the facility has already had 14 records of violations and 34 malfunctions from its construction and operating phase, and the plant already exceeded its annual limits for smog-forming air pollutants within its first few months of operation.The Shell Monaca plant is one of the largest ethane plants yet to open in the US. Smaller incidents tend to be self-reported by companies, often with a lag time so residents don’t immediately know the reason why the air may smell or there’s an orange nighttime sky.There are many paths to protecting the public from petrochemicals’ harms. Of course, more work can be done to prevent accidents and promote train safety, while also taking risk management seriously. But safety also starts with rethinking our petrochemicals reliance entirely. Train derailments, routine flaring, and equipment failures show a far darker side than the oil and gas industry usually lets on. From the industry’s view, plastics and petrochemicals will ensure demand for oil and gas for decades, even as the US transitions away from gasoline-powered transportation.All these incidents showcase how the impacts from plastics seep into our lives long before they’re tossed into the trash.

Israel votes. Palestine is under siege.,2022-11-01,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:The Lions’ Den, a new Palestinian resistance group, has emerged. Here’s what that says about the state of the Israel-Palestine conflict. As Israel headed to the polls on Tuesday for its fifth election since 2019, Israeli forces have spent the last month putting Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank under siege. Since early October, the city of Nablus has been choked off by Israeli settlers. Nablus and the refugee camp of Jenin, both in the West Bank, have also been the site of Israeli security raids. The clampdown of Nablus comes in response to the emergence of the Lions’ Den, a Palestinian militant group that shot dead an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint outside the city in early October. Lions’ Den has been using armed resistance against Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank. Unlike Hamas or Islamic Jihad, they are not a religious or ideological faction, and they’re not affiliated with any party. Lions’ Den is specifically resisting the presence of Israeli security forces or settler violence to defend Palestinian cities. “The change here is that they have been using arms as a defensive mechanism when there are raids by Israelis,” Nur Arafeh, a researcher at the Carnegie Middle East Center, told me. “We’re talking about an oppressed people choosing to resist the occupation.” Meanwhile, Israelis voted Tuesday for a new parliament after the collapse of a short-lived “change” government. Initial exit polls suggest a narrow lead by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party. He’s a security-focused hawk who has only reluctantly backed a Palestinian state and has been willing to downplay his commitment to two states to garner votes. Netanyahu has served longer as prime minister than any other Israeli, but what may be different this time is a much more unified coalition. While he has previously run the country with a bloc of many smaller parties, this right-wing coalition would have fewer parties and would be easier to hold together. This will be a more coherent government that can institute policy more effectively. And extreme-right, pro-settler members of his coalition are likely to push for an even harsher crackdown on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.The violence has increased. More than 125 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem already this year. A United Nations official says that this is the most lethal year for Palestinians since 2005. And there is also rising violence against Israelis, according to the UN, with two Israeli security personnel and 25 civilians killed so far this year. Israel has responded with violent raids in Nablus and other West Bank cities, widespread crackdowns, and what human rights groups allege to be the revival of targeted assassinations in the West Bank. For two decades, Israel would conduct arrests and shootouts, or collaborate with the Palestinian Authority’s security services, but would not engage in extrajudicial killing in the West Bank. Then in February, an attack by Israeli security forces killed three Palestinian men who were part of a separate militant group; Israeli forces denied it was a targeted assassination at the time, but human rights groups said the tactics looked similar to that old policy. In late October, the Lions’ Den cited two videos and said that Israel planted a bomb on the motorcycle of operative Tamer al-Kilani that killed him. (Israel and the Palestinian Authority would not comment on the attack to news organizations at the time, and the Israeli military declined to comment to Vox on whether it has revived targeted assassinations as a policy.) But both incidents show the risks Israel is willing to take. This comes as Lions’ Den, and what Al-Jazeera describes as its “core 15-20 members,” is gaining popular support among Palestinians. Last month, Israelis put the Jerusalem refugee camp Shuafat under siege in response to its civil disobedience. Lions’ Den called for a one-day general strike in the West Bank in solidarity that showed the group’s organizing power.This is a uniquely tense moment in the occupied West Bank. The lack of a Palestinian-Israeli peace process, the entrenchment of a 55-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the blockade of Gaza, and the lack of political accountability within the Palestinian government offer few alternatives. This is not yet a widespread movement. But Lions’ Den or future groups like it could galvanize support within, and beyond, the occupied West Bank, which could ultimately lead to more political violence and changing political realities. Yara Asi, a global health researcher at the University of Central Florida, recently returned from visiting family in Nablus. She described in vivid detail the persistent hum of Israeli surveillance drones patrolling above the West Bank city and the intense security queues monitoring every vehicle and person entering and exiting it. “You’re always kind of told the media narrative is ‘it’s a time of relative calm, it’s a time of relative peace.’ And then something happens, and you’ll hear ‘tensions escalated,’ ‘clashes escalated,’” Asi says. She says this framing that we so often read in the press misses the larger point. “For Palestinians, the situation is consistently intolerable.” This is the culmination of political forces of the last 30 years that have disenfranchised Palestinians. The 1993 Oslo Accords, signed on the White House lawn between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), held out the possibility of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel. But that possibility seems further away than ever. The Israeli occupation is so ingrained in the West Bank and East Jerusalem that many human rights organizations and UN experts have started to describe the situation as apartheid. There is a massive expansion of Israeli settlements, and Israeli settlers live under different laws and hold more rights than Palestinians living nearby. The devastating blockade of Gaza and Israel’s persistent bombing of civilian life and infrastructure there has made it untenable. And Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship have far fewer opportunities than Israelis. Today, the Oslo generation is frustrated and has no means by which to channel it. Even as the Palestinian Authority, the Biden administration, and the international community keep talking about a nonexistent two-state solution, the Israeli government often shows signs that it is not interested. Few Israeli politicians have mentioned it on the campaign trail.Lions’ Den is emerging from a political vacuum among Palestinians. Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the PLO, is 87 years old. He is also the president of the Palestinian Authority, which has not held elections since 2009 — he is serving the 17th year of a term that ended long ago. It’s part of why the PA has little legitimacy and has led some Palestinians to view it as a subcontractor of the Israeli occupation. “The representative body for Palestinians is the PLO, not the PA, and those elections have never taken place,” Akram Salhab, a Palestinian activist, told me. “The political process doesn’t exist, and no one even pretends it exists anymore.”The political system in Palestine has in practice excluded young people. “Now you have these new groups of young men in their early 20s who are so disenchanted with the Palestinian Authority, who are under intense oppression by the Israeli occupation, and who decided to take things into their own hands because there’s no political outlook,” says Arafeh. Another driver is the growing violence of Israeli settlers. Lions’ Den has mobilized in areas where settler violence is the highest and the most extremist settlers live. Neither Palestinian authorities nor Israeli forces have done much to stem settler violence. In many cases, the settlers have the backing of the Israeli state. Haaretz reported that, according to an Israeli security source, there were more than 100 incidents of settler violence in the West Bank over 10 days in October. A UN report from last month noted that by “ignoring settler violence originating in outposts and not applying legal sanctions against settlers breaking the law,” Israel sends a “clear message” that such behavior is okay. A senior Biden diplomat condemned the UN report as one-sided. Yet the US State Department has reported extensively on settler violence, including in its annual reporting on terrorism, where it noted that in 2020 the UN had “documented 771 incidents of settler violence that brought injury to 133 Palestinians and damaged 9,646 trees and 184 vehicles, mostly in the areas of Hebron, Jerusalem, Nablus, and Ramallah.”That’s all set against the broader ongoing oppression. The United Nations notes that in the last three months, “In total, 32 Palestinians, including six children, were killed by Israeli security forces during demonstrations, clashes, search-and-arrest operations, attacks and alleged attacks against Israelis, and other incidents.”It’s in this context that the Palestinians also feel abandoned by the United States, which is one of Israel’s closest international partners. President Joe Biden’s administration has changed some of its rhetoric from staunchly anti-Palestinian Trump policies, but Biden has also quietly maintained much of Trump’s status quo, including keeping the US embassy in Jerusalem and focusing on deals between Israel and Arab states rather than Israeli-Palestinian talks. There’s also a sense of abandonment from Arab governments. Countries like the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and Bahrain have normalized relations with Israel, breaking their pledge to hold off doing so until there was an independent Palestinian state. Even Saudi Arabia, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights, has become a comfortable place for Israeli business. This suggests to Israel that it can have it both ways: a clampdown on Palestinians and lucrative normalization deals with Arab states. In October, Israel announced a new law in which citizens of Arab countries it now has diplomatic ties to (Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, and Bahrain) visiting Israel are largely restricted from visiting the West Bank. “Big picture: These accords have facilitated Israel’s capacity for repression in some ways, but also exacerbated the conditions where Palestinians are on the sidelines, that there isn’t really any kind of international pressure or movement to resolve some of the worsening political conditions,” Dana El Kurd, a political scientist at the University of Richmond, told me. The Lions’ Den’s actual membership is small, but it has proved galvanizing for many living under occupation. Though Israeli forces have put entire cities under siege, it’s not likely they’ll be able to eradicate the new group. Even as Israel targets its more prominent members, Lions’ Den is fragmented, dispersed, and essentially leaderless by design, according to the experts I interviewed. A Palestinian Authority governor in Nablus met last month with Lions’ Den members and urged them to give up their weapons in return for an amnesty arrangement, but they rebuffed the offer. Israel, meanwhile, has vowed to continue targeting the group, alleging it is “trying to carry out attacks.”“Our goal was and remains to strike hard and continuously at terrorists and those who dispatch them in Jenin, Nablus and wherever terrorism takes root; we will not relent even for a moment,” Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in October after Israeli forces conducted a raid that killed a member of Lions’ Den.Elderly neighbors that Asi, the global health scholar, spoke to in Nablus explained that this was the harshest blockade that they had experienced in 50 years. In the past, maybe Israelis would shut down the city for a couple of days, but now it has been a couple of weeks with checkpoints controlling all movement in and out of Nablus. People can’t leave to get urgent medical care, to visit family or to work, all while Israeli settlers are able to travel via an alternate network of roads that allows them to bypass Palestinian cities. “It has been really devastating to the city, especially just the uncertainty of it,” Asi says. “The tea kettle is screaming, it’s boiling, and occasionally that leads to violence.”One question is whether this leads to unification among disparate Palestinians in disparate locales — across the occupied West Bank and in Gaza, in Jerusalem and in Israel’s 1948 borders.“Israel has imposed collective punishment,” says Arafeh, “so that Palestinians wouldn’t be able to go to universities or to schools. The Israeli assumption is that Palestinians would be fed up with this resistance because it’s not allowing them to go to schools, universities, or to ship products.”But that assumption might not hold. Ibrahim al-Nabulsi was the 18-year-old apparent co-founder of Lions’ Den. He was killed in a shootout with Israeli forces in September, and his final hideout has since become a shrine.“If you’re Palestinian today, and you look around you, what you see is an extreme, violent military occupation, which manifests in every tiny detail of your life,” says Salhab, the Jerusalem-based activist.And not all aspects of the suppression of Palestinians are so headline-grabbing. Salhab emphasizes the mundane aspects of occupation, the way he says that Israeli authorities count the number of toothbrushes there are in Palestinian homes in Jerusalem, where he lives, to confirm how many residents live in a given home. As he put it, “People don’t understand how that builds to a societal pressure that will lead to Palestinians only seeing one solution, which is resistance to Israel.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Mike Pompeo’s RNC address is a scandal,2020-08-24,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:“We should not be using American diplomacy for partisan political purposes,” a State Department official critical of Pompeo’s upcoming address told Vox.When Mike Pompeo addresses the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, he’ll be solidifying his place as the most partisan secretary of state in decades — and tarnishing the proudly independent reputation of the agency he leads.The nation’s chief diplomat is on official travel to the Middle East to handle important foreign policy issues, namely how to strengthen a US-brokered deal to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Instead of spending all his time focused on those matters, though, Pompeo will also address voters back home, using the backdrop of the holy city of Jerusalem (very literally, as he’s expected to deliver a recorded message from a rooftop somewhere in the city) to boost the president’s reelection campaign. “Looking forward to sharing with you how my family is more SAFE and more SECURE because of President Trump,” Pompeo tweeted on Sunday. “See you all on Tuesday night!”That will shatter years of precedent in which sitting Cabinet members, and especially high-profile ones like secretaries of state, don’t engage in openly political and partisan activities. It was a norm Pompeo’s predecessors — in both Republican and Democratic administrations — believed was important to uphold.As Stephanie Epner, a former adviser to Secretary of State John Kerry, told me, her former boss purposely “did not wade into domestic politics” while he was at the State Department. “He was America’s chief diplomat, not Democrats’ chief diplomat, and he took that very seriously.”This norm is why longtime State Department employees I spoke to are furious with Pompeo’s decision to feature in the Republican Party’s showpiece. “It’s inappropriate on so many levels,” a State official told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share candid views. “We should not be using American diplomacy for partisan political purposes.”Pompeo seemingly agreed with that sentiment at one point: In February, he approved a State Department memo that says, in bold type: “Senate-confirmed Presidential appointees may not even attend a political party convention or convention-related event.” And in a July 24 memo obtained by Vox and signed by Pompeo, it clearly states the department’s “longstanding policy” is that employees “may not engage in partisan political activity while posted or on TDY abroad, even on personal time.” But ask State’s press officers if they see anything wrong with Pompeo’s participation, and you get a strong pushback. The secretary “will address the convention in his personal capacity,” a State Department spokesperson told me without explaining how it violates the agency’s policy, adding that none of Pompeo’s staff is involved in drafting his remarks or arranging the appearance. And though his address will take place while Pompeo is on official travel, the spokesperson said taxpayers won’t incur any costs related to his speech.That last part may be true in a technical sense, but it certainly comes close to, if not outright crosses, an ethical line. Pompeo will be using the Israeli capital — the city President Donald Trump moved the US embassy to two years ago, fulfilling a key campaign promise — as the backdrop for his address. But taxpayers are footing the bill for his trip so he can conduct American foreign policy, not to provide him with a politically useful scene for a Republican Party convention speech. Were he not traveling there as secretary of state on a taxpayer-funded trip, he wouldn’t be in the Israeli capital. The spokesperson didn’t answer further questions on this point.Still, four teams of lawyers, including State’s legal counsel, reportedly looked at Pompeo’s planned comments to ensure they don’t cross any ethical lines, and apparently they signed off on them. One reason may be because Pompeo isn’t officially attending the event, but rather sending in a short pre-recorded speech from a rooftop in Jerusalem.That Pompeo would even consider coming near such a clear red line, though, is typical behavior. “This is consistent with Pompeo’s entire tenure: unprecedented and completely predictable,” said Daniel Drezner, a US foreign policy expert at Tufts University’s Fletcher School who has written extensively on the secretary’s time in charge. After all, Pompeo has used his station to hold secret meetings with Republican donors, fire inspectors general for looking into his possible misconduct, travel repeatedly to Kansas while contemplating a Senate run, stonewall Democrat-led congressional inquiries while aiding Republican-helmed probes, and even troll the Democrats on Twitter during their national convention last week.Simply put, these are not the actions of a secretary of state with the interests of the entire nation in mind. They are the actions of a hyperpartisan Cabinet member who puts his, the president’s, and the Republican Party’s desires first.Which leads into another troubling aspect of Pompeo’s RNC appearance: The speech is almost sure to be seen as a blatant appeal to conservative evangelical voters, an important constituency when it comes to Trump’s reelection. Pompeo’s decision, then, may actually hurt the US-Israel relationship he aims to bolster.Poll after poll shows that white evangelical Christians, who form a strong contingent of the Republican Party, support Trump’s handling of the US-Israel relationship more than any other group. There’s a good reason for that. Along with the embassy move and the Israel-UAE pact, Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal to place heavy sanctions on the country, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and unveiled an Israel-Palestine “peace” plan that essentially gave far-right Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nearly everything he wanted. At that proposal’s unveiling in January, Netanyahu showered Trump with praise: “You have been the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.” Many evangelicals share that feeling. “Evangelicals in the United States trust President Trump on the issue of Israel because he’s been so supportive,” Joel Rosenberg, a dual US-Israel citizen and an evangelical, told the National Catholic Reporter that month. “They’re not dealing with a hostile president, like President Obama. They’re dealing with a friend who has been enormously helpful to Israel.”Trump is aware of his popularity in that community and is quite open about making policy decisions on the US-Israel relationship with evangelicals in mind. “We moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. That’s for the evangelicals,” he said during a campaign stop in Wisconsin last week.It helps explain why Pompeo would take the opportunity to address that constituency during his Middle East trip. But there also seems to be a deeper reason: Pompeo, an evangelical himself, seems to believe Trump’s leadership has the divine seal of approval.Asked by CBN News last year if God raised up Trump like the biblical figure Queen Esther, who helped save Jews from death by order of a Persian official, Pompeo said, “As a Christian, I certainly believe that’s possible ... I am confident that the Lord is at work here.” But using Israel as a political prop in this way could actually harm America’s relationship with that country. “It’s really bad for the long-term bilateral relationship for Israel to become a partisan issue,” said the State official critical of Pompeo’s planned RNC appearance. Partisan divisions over Israel have only grown wider in the Trump era because of how unabashedly the president pursues pro-Israel policies and because of Netanyahu’s violation of Palestinian rights, which has weakened support for Israel among liberal Democrats.Pompeo’s address could also backfire on Trump politically. “It may score some points with evangelical voters, but it will hurt Trump with Jewish voters, who value maintaining Israel as a bipartisan issue in US politics and object to it being [used] for partisan political purposes,” said Daniel Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel. But Trump and Pompeo both seem to think the speech will help fire up the base. And so, as Shapiro put it, describing their view: “Screw the norms.”New goal: 25,000 In the spring, we launched a program asking readers for financial contributions to help keep Vox free for everyone, and last week, we set a goal of reaching 20,000 contributors.

Why the Trump administration is sanctioning a top international court,2020-06-12,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:The US wants to protect its personnel serving in Afghanistan, and it also wants to protect Israel.President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday sanctioning members of the International Criminal Court, the global judicial body investigating American troops for possible war crimes during the Afghanistan war.The provocative move targets court staff involved in the probe, as well as their families, blocking them from accessing assets held in US financial institutions and from visiting America. Top members of the Trump administration — including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper — made the announcement with surprisingly forceful language to make their point.“We cannot allow ICC officials and their families to come to the United States to shop, travel, and otherwise enjoy American freedoms as these same officials seek to prosecute the defenders of those very freedoms,” Pompeo, a former Army officer, told reporters without taking questions.On the surface, the order appears solely designed to pressure lawyers into dropping the investigation of US military and intelligence personnel, specifically their treatment of detainees in Afghanistan and Europe from 2003 to 2004. While that’s a major reason for Trump’s decision, there’s another equally important one: persuading the court not to open an official probe into Israel’s policies toward the Palestinian territories.At Palestine’s request, the ICC is on the verge of officially investigating alleged war crimes by Israelis and Palestinians during the 2014 Gaza war, and may also determine if Israeli settlements in the West Bank constitute a war crime. That possibility has severely angered Trump administration leaders, perhaps none more than Pompeo.“We’re also gravely concerned about the threat the court poses to Israel,” he said on Thursday. “It’s clear the ICC is only putting Israel in its crosshairs for nakedly political purposes.”It was only a month ago Pompeo promised to “exact consequences” on the ICC if it didn’t lay off Israel. Now, those consequences have been exacted. “This is for sure the most serious step the administration has taken against the court,” David Bosco, an expert on the ICC at Indiana University Bloomington, told me.But the move may ultimately have a more pernicious effect. Elizabeth Evenson, the associate director for international justice at Human Rights Watch, said it’s “really an effort to try to thwart the access of victims to justice before the ICC.”Which means the US didn’t just open a unilateral fight against a global court. It launched a judicial world conflict that could further harm people the US may have already severely mistreated.To understand the action the Trump administration just took, it’s important to understand the two decades of tensions between the ICC and the US.The ICC is a permanent intergovernmental body located in The Hague, in the Netherlands, tasked with prosecuting individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The body was established by the Rome Statute in 2002, which has since been ratified by 123 countries — but not the United States, even though it did sign onto it.The reason the US didn’t want to be under the court’s jurisdiction is simple enough: US leaders from both parties feared the ICC could prosecute Americans — and especially troops operating around the world — outside of the American legal system.President Bill Clinton, initially a supporter of the ICC, delayed signing the Rome Statute by 18 months until December 31, 2000, the last possible day, over concerns the body would interfere with US military activities. Afterward, Clinton encouraged President George W. Bush to further negotiate terms of the statute before submitting it for Senate approval.But Bush actively opposed ratification, believing Americans would be unfairly prosecuted, and declared in May 2002 that the US would not pursue official ICC membership. President Barack Obama made no further effort to join the ICC, though his administration lent assistance to ICC investigations as a way to strengthen the America’s relationship with the court.Enter Trump, who has made his antagonism toward international organizations — and specifically the ICC — a constant of his foreign policy. “As far as America is concerned, the ICC has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy, and no authority,” he said during his 2018 UN address. “The ICC claims near-universal jurisdiction over the citizens of every country, violating all principles of justice, fairness, and due process. We will never surrender America’s sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy.”He’s followed through on that antagonism already, revoking ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s US visa last year over the Afghanistan war inquiry. Trump’s hope, experts said, was to stop Bensouda from pursuing the case. Instead, she persisted — leading the president to escalate his spat with Thursday’s executive order.“It’s an attempt to obstruct the prosecutor’s independence,” Human Rights Watch’s Evenson told me.After a years-long, dragged-out process, the ICC in March decided it would officially pursue its case into alleged war crimes during the war in Afghanistan. Even though the US isn’t party to the court, Afghanistan is. The body’s lawyers believe they have the right to investigate any potential war crimes that happen within a member state, according to experts.Importantly, though, the ICC’s probe isn’t just into what US troops have done. Lawyers are also digging into actions by the Taliban and Afghan forces during the conflict. But a main focus certainly will be on allegations that US personnel illegally detained prisoners between 2003 and 2004 not only in Afghanistan, but also in Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.“The information available provides a reasonable basis to believe that members of United States of America (“US”) armed forces and members of the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations, principally in the 2003-2004 period,” the prosecutor wrote in 2017.It’s still unclear, of course, what exactly happened in those locations. But the ACLU already represents three detainees who claim they were tortured in Afghanistan during that time period, and Human Rights Watch estimates that the US held about 1,000 prisoners during that era. Among them were two men detained by US forces two months in 2013 after their brother was killed in an explosion. The US released both men after determining they had nothing to do with the bombing and had no affiliation with anti-US groups.The probe into American conduct during the war, some experts say, is why the Trump administration has continually denounced the court. That seems clear based on what top officials say about it.“The ICC’s effort to target American servicemen and women and other public servants are unfounded, illegitimate, and make a mockery of justice,” Robert O’Brien, the national security, said during Thursday’s press conference. He also asserted, without evidence or specificity, that “our adversaries are manipulating the ICC by encouraging these allegations” — a claim experts said they hadn’t heard the US make about the court before.The administration may be talking tough, freezing assets, and restricting visas because it knows it’s in a good position. The Afghan government is opposed to the ICC probe, and the US will clearly not cooperate with it. It’ll therefore be very hard for global prosecutors to make any progress on the American aspect of the investigation. “I think it will be a long time before we see any arrest warrants,” said Indiana University’s Bosco. Indeed, any concrete action may come long after Trump leaves the Oval Office, even if he’s reelected this year.Which is another indication that Thursday’s decision is less about this specific ICC case and more about another one facing a key US ally: Israel.In December, the ICC said it had concluded a preliminary investigation into alleged war crimes during the 2014 Gaza War and continued Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which the court may determine are war crimes themselves. The result wasn’t what Israel’s government wanted to hear.“In brief, I am satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,” Bensouda, the chief prosecutor, said. There are “no substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice.” The next step is for the ICC to officially open a probe into both matters the Palestinians, who are ICC members while Israelis are not, referred to the court.The war part is easy to understand. A skirmish that began over murdered Israeli students turned into a seven-week fight between Hamas, the militant groups that controls that Gaza Strip, and Israel. Israel started launching airstrikes on Gaza, and Palestinians responded by firing rockets into Israel. Then on July 17, 2014, the Israeli military invaded Gaza, in part to close down tunnels that allowed Hamas to secretly enter Israel and attack the country. Ground fighting led to a spike in Palestinian casualties, which quickly went from a few hundred into the thousands.The conflict eventually ended in August, with both sides agreeing to an Egypt-brokered ceasefire. Israel said it would relax the blockade on Gaza; Hamas declared that it won the war. More than 2,100 Palestinians and 71 Israelis were killed, while more than 10,000 people — mostly Palestinians — sustained injuries.As for the West Bank, about 500,000 Israelis have moved into the territory since Israel captured it in a 1967 war. Palestinians say such settlements ruin any chance of having a sovereign country in the future after striking a peace deal with Israel.There’s clearly a lot for the ICC to look into, which is why the global court is moving forward with the probes. And yet, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch Trump administration ally, blasted the December announcement at the time, calling it a “black day for truth and justice” and a “baseless and scandalous decision.” His stance surely hasn’t changed, evidenced by the fact he has plans to annex much of the West Bank in the near future with US support.Of course, Netanyahu has a lot to worry about personally. In the US case, those who may get in trouble are mid-level troops or CIA staffers. In the Israeli case — which features high-level policy decisions — someone at the minister level, including Netanyahu himself, may face prosecution.Put together, America is taking action now so the ICC stops looking into Israel, signaling the worst may yet be to come if it doesn’t.There are now four major outstanding questions after the executive order’s release, all of which could lead to trouble for either the US or the ICC.The first is whether or not the Trump administration’s aggressive moves will lead the ICC to back off both cases. No experts I spoke to, though, believe that’ll happen. “It will occasion some turmoil among the ICC’s team, but won’t make the prosecutor abandon the probe,” Bosco said.The second is what US allies that are ICC members and have their own qualms with the court — mainly the UK, Japan, and Germany — will say. They all have their own troubled war histories, but most experts expect them to stand up for the global body. If that’s the case, it’s likely America’s play will backfire.“This is yet another instance of the Trump administration taking action that will alienate many of America’s closest allies while contributing to an atmosphere of impunity for the world’s worst human rights abusers,” said Rob Berschinski, the senior vice president of Human Rights First.Third, the executive order is problematic as written, experts say. Many note it’s possible for a foreigner working at a human rights organization to be sanctioned by the US if they help write a report that leads to an ICC investigation of an ally. A hypothetical Berschinski outlined was this: If a non-American writes a piece on extrajudicial killings in the Philippines that assists the ICC in a probe of President Rodrigo Duterte, it’s possible the US government now has the right to freeze that person’s assets.It’s unclear the government would follow through, of course, but it’s not out of the question.Finally, Attorney General Bill Barr made a threatening statement toward the end of Thursday’s press conference. “The US government has reason to doubt the honesty of the ICC,” he said. “The Department of Justice has received substantial credible information that raises serious concerns about a long history of financial corruption and malfeasance at the highest levels of the office of the prosecutor.”It’s unclear what, exactly, he’s referring to. Some experts said he might be referencing a 2017 scandal in which the previous ICC chief prosecutor was found to have offshore bank accounts and a dubious advisory role with a Libyan billionaire. But if that’s the case — and no expert can think of what else Barr might be talking about — it’s three-year-old news.Trump’s move, then, leads to more questions than it answers. The main one, of course, is if it will actually work as intended. As of now, it doesn’t look that way.Conor Murray contributed to this report.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What are Israel and Palestine? Why are they fighting?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs both want the same land. And a compromise has proven difficult to find.Editor’s note, November 9, 2023: This story has been updated to reflect details of the current Israel-Hamas war. For all of Vox’s latest coverage on Israel and Palestine, see our storystream.Israel is the world’s only Jewish state, located just east of the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians, the Arab population that hails from the land Israel now controls, refer to the territory as Palestine, and want to establish a state by that name on all or part of the same land. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is over who gets what land and how it’s controlled.Though both Jews and Arab Muslims date their claims to the land back a couple thousand years, the current political conflict began in the early 20th century. Jews fleeing persecution in Europe wanted to establish a national homeland in what was then an Arab- and Muslim-majority territory in the Ottoman and later British Empire. The Arabs resisted, seeing the land as rightfully theirs. An early United Nations plan to give each group part of the land failed, and Israel and the surrounding Arab nations fought several wars over the territory. Today’s lines largely reflect the outcomes of two of these wars, one waged in 1948 and another in 1967.The 1967 war is particularly important for today’s conflict, as it left Israel in control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, two territories home to large Palestinian populations:Today, the West Bank is nominally controlled by the Palestinian Authority and is under Israeli occupation. This comes in the form of Israeli troops, who enforce Israeli security restrictions on Palestinian movement and activities, and Israeli “settlers,” Jews who build ever-expanding communities in the West Bank that effectively deny the land to Palestinians. Gaza is controlled by Hamas, an Islamist militant group; it has been under an Israeli blockade since Hamas seized control in 2007, one so stringent that human rights groups liken the situation to an “open-air prison.”Currently, Israel is at war with Hamas — a conflict following a horrific rampage on October 7, 2023, in which militants from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another extremist group, launched attacks that killed more than 1,400 Israelis and took more than 240 hostage. Israel has responded with widespread bombardment of the Gaza Strip and a ground incursion, killing and injuring tens of thousands of Palestinians.The internationally supported political solution to the broader conflict, endorsed in the past by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, is a so-called “two-state solution.” That would establish Palestine as an independent state in Gaza and most of the West Bank, leaving the rest of the land to Israel. Though the two-state plan is clear in theory, the two sides are still deeply divided over how to make it work in practice. Moreover, influential factions on both sides outright oppose it.The alternative to a two-state solution is a “one-state solution,” wherein all of the land becomes either one big Israel, one big Palestine, or some kind of shared state with a new name. Generally speaking, these outcomes seem even less likely at present than two states — making it hard to imagine any kind of formal resolution happening anytime soon.Predicting the future of the conflict is even harder in the wake of the October 7 attack and subsequent war in Gaza. The war is such a major development, with such major implications for the region, that it could transform the nature of Israeli-Palestinian relations as we know them.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The Trump administration will close the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington,2018-09-10,Vox,['Alexia Underwood'],"Filed under:It’s the Trump administration’s latest attempt to pressure Palestinians to participate in a US-sponsored peace plan.The Trump administration is closing the Washington offices of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to try to pressure the Palestinians to come to the negotiating table ahead of a US-sponsored Middle East peace plan.The decision to close the office is the latest step in a pressure campaign being waged by the Trump administration against Palestinian leadership to get them to comply with a planned Middle East peace proposal, which has yet to be unveiled. The PLO is an official body that represents the Palestinian people. As Vox’s Zack Beauchamp writes, the PLO runs the Palestinian National Authority (PA), the semiautonomous government tasked with managing the Palestinian territories. (Fatah, the secular nationalist political party that’s dominated Palestinian politics for decades, controls the PLO and PA.)Even though the US does not recognize Palestine as a state, the PLO has maintained a diplomatic mission in Washington, DC, since the mid-1990s. But in a statement Monday morning, the State Department blamed the decision to close the office on the Palestinian leadership’s unwillingness to participate in a yet-to-be-released Middle East peace plan, and their failure to “advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.” It also linked the decision to Palestinian attempts to “prompt an investigation of Israel by the International Criminal Court.”National Security Adviser John Bolton also reiterated that the Trump administration would be closing the PLO offices in a speech to the Federalist Society in Washington, DC, on Monday, remarking that “the United States will always stand with our friend and ally, Israel.” Palestinian leadership, for their part, reacted with frustration. Hanan Ashrawi, a senior PLO official, told the Guardian that the US government’s decision was “extremely cruel and spiteful to persist in deliberately bashing the Palestinian people by denying them of their rights, giving away their lands and rightful capital of Jerusalem,” and added that it was a form of “crude and vicious blackmail.”A PLO spokesperson in Ramallah said that the decision was “a declaration of war on efforts to bring peace to our country and the region.” And in a statement, the top Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said it was another example of the Trump administration’s policy of collective punishment against the Palestinian people. The Trump administration’s goal may be to convince the Palestinians to get on board with its peace plan, but it seems to be having the opposite effect. “All of this is making sure the U.S. will never ever play the role of the peacemaker,” Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian representative to Washington, told the Wall Street Journal.Since Trump took office, he hasn’t hesitated to delve into the Palestinian Israeli conflict, and has shirked established US policy.In December 2017, Trump declared that he planned to move the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, effectively recognizing that city as the capital of Israel and breaking with decades of established US policy.The UN and the international community reacted with outrage to the announcement, and Palestinians said that this effectively killed any attempt at a US-brokered peace process. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas went further, saying that Palestinians would not cooperate with proposed peace talks after the embassy decision was announced. Trump, for his part, tweeted in January that the US was giving tons of aid to Palestinians and getting nothing in return. And on August 24, the Trump administration announced that it would “divert” $200 million in aid to Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank, at least some of which would have been dispersed through the Palestinian Authority. A week later, the administration also announced that it was planning to cut all US funding to UNRWA, the United Nations program that administers aid to millions of Palestinian refugees. The US is the largest single donor to the UN agency, responsible for providing about $350 million each year — a quarter of its annual budget.The cuts, and this latest move to shutter the PLO’s offices in Washington, are apparently intended to pressure Palestinians to comply with aspects of a Middle East peace proposal that the Trump administration has been working on for several months. Few details have been leaked to the press, and it’s unclear when the plan will be made public.Israeli leadership has yet to publicly comment on the move, which took place during the Jewish New Year. But the leftist Jewish American group J Street issued a statement condemning the decision, saying that the Trump administration was “kicking the legs out from under any possible negotiating table,” according to Haaretz. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is also a special envoy to the Middle East, has been working on the new plan, which is intended to be a long-term resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But based on the few details that have leaked out, experts say that it’s unlikely to be successful, and it’s unclear how the US and Israel would proceed without Palestinian participation. In June, Erekat told NBC News that Kushner’s peace plan, which reportedly refuses to recognize Palestinian rights or a Palestinian state, was doomed to fail. “Kushner represents a policy of dictation rather than negotiations,” he said. “It is the Trump Administration that has walked away from the negotiations, from international law and U.N. resolutions.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Iran could determine how far the Israel-Hamas war spreads,2023-11-04,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups support Hamas but haven’t opened new fronts.In his first public statement about Israel’s war with Hamas, Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday indicated that the Shia militant group — though supportive of Hamas’s bloody October 7 attack on Israel — wouldn’t be opening up another front in the war just yet. Hezbollah, which the US and other countries have designated as a terror group, has engaged in cross-border firefights with Israel since the October 7 attack. That’s not particularly new; there is regularly low-level conflict across the so-called Blue Line, the line of demarcation between Lebanon and Israel, which UN peacekeepers have been deployed to monitor since 2006. But given its proximity to the conflict and Hezbollah’s close affiliation with Iran, it’s a possible front to expand the war.Lebanon is not the only place at risk of spillover conflict; Iran-backed militias have been attacking US forces in Iraq and Syria, launching 27 attacks at US bases since October 17 after several months without any such attacks. And the Houthis, an Iran-backed Shia group which controls much of western and northwestern Yemen, have lobbed missiles and drones in Israel’s direction, though those have been intercepted by US warships in the eastern Mediterranean, as well as by Israeli missile defense systems. “The Iranians are happy to activate their proxy groups and let other people do the fighting and dying — and frankly a lot of the proxy groups are happy to do the fighting and dying,” Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox.  Iran, to varying degrees, funds and provides resources to each of these groups, as well as Hamas. “Iran’s relationship with other groups really fits onto a spectrum,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, told Vox. “At one side of the spectrum you have Hezbollah, because Iran’s relationship with Hezbollah is really like two NATO allies.” Hezbollah has only Iran as a state backer, while Hamas and militant groups in Iraq and Syria have relationships with other nations.Though Nasrallah and Iranian leadership have praised Hamas’s attack and threatened retaliation for Israel’s aggressive bombing and ground campaign in Gaza — whether through a proxy group or outright — a “red line” for doing so isn’t clear nearly a month into the war.All of these groups give Iran options about where and how it wants to send messages to its adversaries — the US and Israel — while ostensibly giving the Islamic Republic a measure of plausible deniability. But this tactic is not without risk, especially without direct diplomatic channels between the adversaries. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]The US, in addition to providing Israel with weapons and material support, has moved major military assets to the region — two carrier strike groups, and now a guided missile submarine carrying up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles. The move is meant as a further deterrent to Iran and its related groups in the region as Secretary of State Antony Blinken makes another trip to the Middle East, in part to try and contain the conflict to Gaza.“To me, there are two ways this could expand: one is by calculation, and one is by miscalculation,” Alterman said. Iran likely would not want to attack Israel or the US decisively and directly, but an error or a step too far by Iran or any of its proxies could push the conflict outside the bounds of Gaza. “At a time of heightened alert … somebody’s missile could go awry, it may kill somebody. You could have commanders who are freelancing,” or working outside the directions of Iran or another proxy group, “anything can happen, and you can get yourself into a pretty rapid escalation pretty quickly.”Though none of the proxy groups would act without Iran’s go-ahead, Hezbollah is in lock-step with Iran ideologically and tactically; Nasrallah and his group are not acting independently. But Lebanon has its own longstanding conflict with Israel, and Hezbollah plays a big role in that.Israel has occupied the Shebaa Farms area, which was once part of southern Lebanon, since 1967, and invaded southern Lebanon in 1978 and 1982, ultimately occupying part of the country south of the Litani River until 2000. Lebanon was in the midst of a brutal, sectarian civil war, and Hezbollah emerged in the early 1980s in part to serve and represent the Shia population in the south, which was being marginalized by the Lebanese Christian ruling minority as well as an influx of Sunni Muslim Palestinian refugees and resistance groups, upsetting Lebanon’s precarious political balance. Over time, and with significant Iranian support, Hezbollah emerged as a potent political and militant force in southern Lebanon and on the national stage. Militarily, Hezbollah aimed to push the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) out of southern Lebanon. When Hezbollah in July 2006 fired rockets at Israeli positions and crossed the border to kill and kidnap IDF soldiers, Israel attacked Lebanon, setting off just over a month of war until a UN-mediated ceasefire took effect August 14.Since that conflict, Hezbollah has grown its capabilities; Nasrallah claims his group has 100,000 fighters, thousands of whom have been honing their skills by supporting Bashar al-Assad’s forces in Syria over the past 12 years. Iran has also maintained its support, helping the group obtain a vast arsenal of rockets and artillery, including longer-range Iranian models with higher payloads. Hezbollah also now possesses the ability to retrofit older rockets and turn them into precision-guided missiles, according to Reuters. That means Hezbollah could fire deeper into Israel and target critical infrastructure. Hezbollah is also a political actor, holding 62 seats as part of a coalition in Lebanon’s parliament. It lost a number of seats in the last round of elections and a war would be extremely unpopular in Lebanon, which is undergoing both a political and economic crisis; the country has been without a government for a year, and its currency, the lira, is at an all-time low value of 100,000 to the US dollar. US officials have met with the Lebanese caretaker government in an effort to try and prevent the conflict from spreading into Lebanon. Hezbollah maintaining power in Lebanon also means Iran keeping power in the country — power which it aims to deploy when necessary. “Once Iran needs to use Hezbollah, they will, despite what happens to Lebanon,” Hanin Ghaddar, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told Vox. And though it has a larger ground force than Hamas, “they would be running up against probably 100,000 fully alert, dug-in Israeli troops — and that is a suicidal mission,” James Jeffrey, former US special envoy to the Coalition to Defeat ISIS, told Vox. For now, Iran has likely calculated the threat of Hezbollah’s increased missile arsenal is enough to keep Israel from taking significant action in Lebanon.Hamas officials have met with Hezbollah senior leaders in Lebanon — and likely encouraged them to do more to support Hamas or otherwise challenge Israel, Ghaddar said. But whether they do so will depend entirely on Iran, she added. “Hezbollah’s job today is to protect Iranian interests, not to support Hamas or the Palestinians.” Though Hamas and Hezbollah do coordinate regarding attacks on Israel, Ghaddar said, “Hamas’s expectation was a lot more [support]” against Israel. “I think what happened is [Hamas] realized they are being thrown into the fire for Iran to establish certain political gains,” such as scuttling normalization processes between Israel and Arab states. “Hezbollah’s job is to protect these gains and help Iran use the Hezbollah threat to translate these gains into more political, economic gains. And Hamas really has been duped into this [conflict].” The US, meanwhile, has launched multiple airstrikes against proxy groups in Iraq and Syria since attacks on US installations resumed on October 17. But rather than real threats of a new front in the war, these and Houthi missiles launched toward Israel look more like a signal of Iran’s displeasure about Israel and the US’s military actions than they do a real threat of escalation — for now.“There is a core network of Iranian-controlled groups in Iraq that run these front groups” which are carrying out rocket attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria, according to Phillip Smyth, an independent analyst who focuses on Hezbollah and jihadi groups in the region. Several core jihadi groups affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Force, or IRGC, are directing a number of front groups in Iraq and Syria. These groups have been launching rocket attacks since about 2020, after the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, a revered leader in the Iranian military. Some of the groups have been around much longer — since 2005 at least — and are trusted allies of the Iranian regime. They’re unlikely to deviate from Iran’s strategy and interests in the region. But other, smaller front groups aren’t necessarily quite so closely aligned, Smyth said, and can sometimes mistakenly go off-course or outright flout Iran’s orders. Hamas official Osama Hamdan did meet with the leader of the front group Asaib Ahl al-Haq, according to the UAE outlet the National. Hamdan told Lebanese pro-Iran TV channel Al Mayadeen that Hamas is “looking forward to an important role to be played by Iraq for the Palestinian cause.”But that meeting doesn’t signal that these front groups will do anything more than lob rockets at US military installations — unless Iran decides it serves their interest.As for the Houthis, many factions of the group are intensely loyal to Iran, but they have their own interests, too — namely regaining control in Yemen. For 1,000 years, a Zaydi Shia imamate ruled Yemen, but it was overthrown in 1962 and Yemen’s Zaydi Muslims — including the Houthis — were stripped of their political power. The Houthi movement started in the 1990s, as a protest against increasing Saudi financial and religious power in northern Yemen. Iran and Hezbollah support the Houthis because they see the Houthis as part of a Shia revival and struggle against Sunni Islam.Yemen has been in a brutal civil war between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed central government, creating the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, according to the UN. Though the Houthis have made gestures of solidarity with Hamas by launching rockets, they’re also unlikely to open up another front in the war simply because they have their own concerns, namely trying to negotiate a political settlement and officially end the conflict. There’s also the issue of serious, unrelenting poverty in Yemen and increased terrorist violence by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).Iran, for its part, also has significant domestic problems that make it difficult to imagine they’d risk direct conflict with the US and Israel; the government and the supreme leader are extremely unpopular, as evidenced by widespread protests over the past year. Surging poverty, unemployment, and inflation are further angering ordinary Iranians; open conflict isn’t likely to help the government’s problems.Public sentiment in the US, though generally supportive of Israel, would not support further US involvement in the Middle East. And growing protests against the war and calls for an immediate ceasefire in response to the devastation Israel has brought on Palestinian civilians in Gaza are pushing US officials to de-escalate the conflict.Israel has thus far ignored those calls —from the US, its neighbors, and from its own citizens. So far in the conflict, IDF strikes have killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and 12 Hamas leaders, according to the IDF.Update, November 6, 10:50 am ET: This story, originally published November 4, has been updated to include the deployment of US military assets to the region.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What is Zionism?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:In brief, it’s Israel’s national ideology, with Judaism serving as both a nationality and religion.Zionism is Israel’s national ideology. Zionists believe Judaism is a nationality as well as a religion, and that Jews deserve their own state in their ancestral homeland, Israel, in the same way the French people deserve France or the Chinese people should have China. It’s what brought Jews back to Israel in the first place, and also at the heart of what concerns Arabs and Palestinians about the Israeli state.Jews often trace their nationhood back to the biblical kingdoms of David and Solomon, circa 950 BC. Modern Zionism, building on the longstanding Jewish yearning for a “return to Zion,” began in the 19th century — right about the time that nationalism started to rise in Europe. A secular Austrian Jewish journalist, Theodor Herzl, was the first to turn rumblings of Jewish nationalism into an international movement around 1896.Herzl witnessed brutal European antisemitism firsthand and became convinced the Jewish people could never survive outside of a country of their own. He wrote essays and organized meetings that spurred mass Jewish emigration from Europe to what’s now Israel/Palestine. Before Herzl, about 20,000 Jews lived there; by the time Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, the number was about eight times that.Though Zionists all agree that Israel should exist, they’ve long disagreed on what its government should look like. In the most general terms, the Zionist left, which dominated the country’s politics until the late 1970s, is inclined to trade Israeli-controlled land for peace with Arab nations, wants more government intervention in the economy, and prefers a secular government over a religious one. The Zionist right, which currently enjoys commanding positions in the Israeli government and popular opinion, tends to be more skeptical of “land-for-peace” deals, more libertarian on the economy, and more comfortable mixing religion and politics.Arabs and Palestinians generally oppose Zionism, as the explicitly Jewish character of the Israeli state means that Jews have privileges that others don’t. For instance, any Jew anywhere in the world can become an Israeli citizen, a right not extended to any other class of person. Arabs, then, often see Zionism as a species of colonialism and racism aimed at appropriating Palestinian land and systematically disenfranchising the Palestinians that remain. Arab states actually pushed through a UN General Assembly resolution labeling Zionism “a form of racism and racial discrimination” in 1975, though it was repealed 16 years later.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Cornel West’s attacks on Ta-Nehisi Coates, explained",2017-12-20,Vox,['German Lopez'],"Filed under:Coates is the latest target in West’s war against Obama.A public feud between two of America’s top black intellectuals has led one of them to abandon Twitter.Cornel West, author of the well-known Race Matters, has been increasingly critical of Ta-Nehisi Coates, the Atlantic writer and author of Between the World and Me and We Were Eight Years in Power. This culminated on Monday night, when Coates left Twitter — a day after West published an op-ed in the Guardian that called Coates “the neoliberal face of the black freedom struggle.”At face value, this might seem like just another feud between some famous men. But there are deeper issues going on here — rooted in Coates’s and West’s approaches to racism and, in particular, West’s own views of former President Barack Obama.Central to all of this is West’s critique that Coates is a “neoliberal” who isn’t critical enough of Obama — especially on issues that are important to the left, such as Wall Street and drone strikes.Coates has countered that he does not write about these other issues because they are simply not his area of expertise. His writing focuses on issues and policies that are directly linked to race, including his well-known case for reparations and recent essays about Obama and President Donald Trump. That’s not to say he doesn’t care about other issues, but he says he simply doesn’t have the expertise to give them the kind of coverage they deserve.West, however, argues that leaving out these other issues means Coates fails to fully address important topics that can help lift up disadvantaged black communities.It’s actually not clear how much Coates and West disagree here. (Neither responded to requests for comment about these specific issues.) But the feud has transformed into a bit of a proxy war in a broader debate about how America should confront its history of racism — an issue that became more prominent with the 2016 Democratic primary between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, which elevated questions about identity politics’ role in left-wing American politics.Before we get into all of that, though, let’s start with what West said about Coates.West’s criticism of Coates goes back years. In 2015, he described Coates as “a clever wordsmith with journalistic talent who avoids any critique of the Black president in power.” In this way, West has long characterized Coates as a protector of “neoliberalism,” a term commonly used by the left to describe the market-friendly, globalist policies of the Democratic Party, including Obama, over the past few decades.But West’s criticisms resurfaced in the past month when he brought up Coates in an interview with the New York Times Magazine. In discussing the “black elite leadership” that has tried to fit into “a neoliberal world,” West cited “[d]ear brother Ta-Nehisi Coates” as an example. Commenting on Coates’s book, We Were Eight Years in Power, West remarked, “Who’s the ‘we’? When’s the last time he’s been through the ghetto, in the hoods, to the schools and indecent housing and mass unemployment? We were in power for eight years? My God. Maybe he and some of his friends might have been in power, but not poor working people.”West further elaborated on this point in his op-ed in the Guardian on Sunday, arguing that Coates’s analysis of white supremacy neglects some of its worst crimes. “He represents the neoliberal wing that sounds militant about white supremacy but renders black fightback invisible,” West wrote. “This wing reaps the benefits of the neoliberal establishment that rewards silences on issues such as Wall Street greed or Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands and people.”He added, “The disagreement between Coates and me is clear: any analysis or vision of our world that omits the centrality of Wall Street power, US military policies, and the complex dynamics of class, gender, and sexuality in black America is too narrow and dangerously misleading. So it is with Ta-Nehisi Coates’ worldview.”West takes particular issue with how Coates has described Obama. In his book, Coates claims that Obama, like Malcolm X, exemplifies “‘our living, Black manhood’ and ‘our own Black shining prince.’”West rejects this: “This gross misunderstanding of who Malcolm X was — the greatest prophetic voice against the American Empire — and who Barack Obama is — the first black head of the American Empire — speaks volumes about Coates’ neoliberal view of the world.” Coates occasionally defended himself from these types of attacks on Twitter. But on Monday, after facing an onslaught on social media — which included white nationalist Richard Spencer approving of West’s criticism — Coates shut down his Twitter account altogether.To really understand why West is going after Coates, it’s important to understand that West has long been one of Obama’s top critics on the left — and, by extension, a harsh critic of anyone who he perceives as defending Obama.In 2011, West described Obama as “a black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black puppet of corporate plutocrats. And now he has become head of the American killing machine and is proud of it.” And in 2015, he called Obama “the first niggerized black president.”“A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and fighting against white supremacy,” West said on CNN. “So when many of us said we have to fight against racism, what were we told? ‘No, he can’t deal with racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He’s the president of all America, not just black America.’ We know he’s president of all America, but white supremacy is American as cherry pie.”In short, West argued that Obama didn’t do enough to dismantle white supremacy. Some of that was rooted in Obama’s timid public response to police killings and the Black Lives Matter protests that followed. But it was also rooted in issues that people might not at first link to white supremacy — including Obama’s campaign support from Wall Street, the US’s ongoing wars in the Middle East and Central Asia, and America’s support of Israel in its conflict with Palestine.“I don’t view good negro government as policies that don’t highlight poor people, that have drone strikes, that’s tied to Wall Street, that reinforces surveillance,” West said in an interview with the Root.From West’s perspective, neoliberalism — the kind, in his view, upheld by Obama and enabled by Coates — has not only kept black Americans worse off compared to their white counterparts; it has also taken the oppression of nonwhite groups to a global scale, as demonstrated by the exploitation of Africa and wars against predominantly brown populations in the Middle East and Central Asia.This isn’t a totally fair characterization of Obama’s record. The Affordable Care Act, for one, helped millions of low-income people get health insurance. The stimulus package of 2009 helped lift the economy in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Dodd-Frank enacted new regulations on financial institutions in Wall Street. But West has been leveling this criticism against US policy, wrapping it all in the mantle of what he views as white supremacy, for years. Coates isn’t even the first fellow black intellectual to come under West’s fire because they wrongly praised, from West’s view, Obama.As Michael Harriot explained in the Root, West has also gone after Al Sharpton, Melissa Harris-Perry, and Michael Eric Dyson. In 2012, West said that Obama was a “Republican in blackface.” Then he blasted Sharpton, Harris-Perry, and Dyson:I love Brother Mike Dyson. But we’re living in a society where everybody is up for sale. Everything is up for sale. And he and Brother Sharpton and Sister Melissa and others, they have sold their souls for a mess of Obama pottage. And we invite them back to the black prophetic tradition after Obama leaves. But at the moment, they want insider access, and they want to tell those kinds of lies. They want to turn their back to poor and working people. And it’s a sad thing to see them as apologists for the Obama administration in that way, given the kind of critical background that all of them have had at some point.There is a lot of public questioning about West’s motives here. Harris-Perry, for one, has argued that West’s beef with Obama is “more personal than ideological,” citing West’s complaint that even though he heavily campaigned for Obama, he couldn’t get tickets for the 2009 inauguration. Still, the fact is that West has long been critical of many of the policies that Obama enacted, from allegedly loose regulations on Wall Street to the continuation of drone strikes around the world.Much of West’s criticism of how Coates describes Obama, however, seems to come from a misunderstanding of Coates’s point.West has criticized the title of Coates’s book, We Were Eight Years in Power, because he interpreted it to suggest that the book means black Americans were, through Obama, eight years in power. In reality, the title of the book comes from a quote from a black Reconstruction-era politician, Rep. Thomas Miller. Miller said, “We were eight years in power. We had built schoolhouses, established charitable institutions, built and maintained the penitentiary system, provided education for the deaf and dumb, rebuilt the ferries. In short, we had reconstructed the State and placed it on the road to prosperity.”In this, Miller points out that when black leaders were elected in the post–Civil War era, they managed to govern without the kinds of catastrophes that racists warned of.It’s this quote and context that opens and drives Coates’s book. When he says that Obama was an example of “good Negro government,” Coates is not saying that he agreed with every single thing that Obama did. (Indeed, Coates criticized Obama for dodging issues of race throughout his presidency.) What he is arguing, instead, is that Obama showed, with a relatively conventional, scandal-free government, that a black person can lead the US — and that alone dealt a big blow to white supremacy.Columnist Charles Mudede explained in the Stranger: “The concept, which West should have given a little more consideration even if he disagreed with it, is this: Whenever blacks show they can rule, white supremacists freak out and do everything they can to bury the evidence of ‘Good Negro Government.’”This doesn’t contradict or even speak to West’s criticisms of Obama, because much of West’s qualms are rooted in specific policies and outcomes. The symbolism of Obama’s victory is less of an interest to West than whether Obama stopped wars in the Middle East and lifted people out of poverty.But Coates argues in his book that the symbolism alone is important: “Barack Obama’s victories in 2008 and 2012 were dismissed by some of his critics as merely symbolic for African Americans. But there is nothing ‘mere’ about symbols. The power embedded in the word nigger is also symbolic. Burning crosses do not literally raise the black poverty rate, and the Confederate flag does not directly expand the wealth gap.”So Obama did some things that people — on the right and left — will find fault with. But in running a stable government, he presented a big challenge to a foundation of white supremacy. That, Coates argues, is worth lifting up.Behind all of this is an underlying debate about how America should confront its long history of racism. In his work, Coates has focused on the politics, history, and direct impacts of white supremacy within the US, from his case for reparations to his look at mass incarceration. This is the area he, by his own admission, has the most knowledge of. Coates is pretty open about the limitations of his knowledge, always cautioning in his blog posts and interviews that he is still learning a lot — and only tries to write about what he knows about. When Daily Show host Trevor Noah asked Coates why he doesn’t write about Wall Street and foreign policy, Coates said, “Because I can’t. I can’t. And I think those people who have specialties on Wall Street and I think those people who have specialties on foreign policy probably can’t write with the depth that I can about race. … I’ve been thinking about this all my life, and I’ve been literally covering it for the past eight years.”West writes about white supremacy more broadly, focusing on the role of neoliberalism in disadvantaging black Americans and other people around the world.Like seemingly every other issue in America currently, this loops back to the 2016 Democratic primary between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Since then, Democrats have been caught in a debate over identity politics and how to deal with issues of race: Is a universal approach that focuses on lifting everyone up — but doesn’t emphasize race, since that might exclude white working-class voters — the right approach? Or does the issue of race need to be directly confronted, up to and possibly including reparations?In a Politico column arguing for Sanders over Clinton, West made the case for a broader approach because, in his view, such an approach would be better for black Americans:The battle now raging in Black America over the Clinton-Sanders election is principally a battle between a declining neoliberal black political and chattering class still on the decaying Clinton bandwagon (and gravy train!) and an emerging populism among black poor, working and middle class people fed up with the Clinton establishment in the Democratic Party. It is easy to use one’s gender identity, as Clinton has, or racial identity, as the Congressional Black Caucus recently did in endorsing her, to hide one’s allegiance to the multi-cultural and multi-gendered Establishment. But a vote for Clinton forecloses the new day for all of us and keeps us captive to the trap of wealth inequality, greed (“everybody else is doing it”), corporate media propaganda and militarism abroad—all of which are detrimental to black America.This again shows the common thread in West’s writing: Anything that fails to include all of these issues, from wealth inequality to militarism, simply fails to address the full scale of white supremacy. That’s why he views Coates’s focused work as inadequate.Notably, Coates supported Sanders over Clinton too, explaining that Sanders’s views on policy, including on criminal justice, were more representative of his own views.But that came with caveats.“Folks need to be aware the history of how racism actually injures universalist policy,” Coates said on Democracy Now. “Every time we’ve had to put forward universalist social policy in this country, at every moment we’ve had to contend with the fact that there is a relatively large population of Americans in this country that are concerned about black people being included in those policies too. That was true in the New Deal. It was true in Obamacare. And it likely would be true with President Sanders also.”That’s, in short, the argument for why it’s important to focus directly on race as its own issue: Even if you believe that universal policies can lift everyone up in theory, the reality is those policies have often left black people behind — sometimes explicitly, as was the case in Social Security’s exclusion of largely black farmers and service workers — as the country has failed to reckon with its history of racism.None of this is to say that Coates or West — or anyone in the Democratic identity politics debate, for that matter — thinks the other side is totally wrong. Coates, after all, backed Sanders, and West supports reparations. Instead, this is more about what should be emphasized in public discussions about race and US policy.So it’s not just a feud between two prominent black thinkers, but rather about deeper issues — particularly among liberals and the left — of how the country should deal with the systemic racism that has long plagued its politics and policies.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
How Pete Buttigieg wants to make America’s roads safer,2023-04-26,Vox,['Jonquilyn Hill'],"Filed under:Our roads are deadly. Here’s how the secretary of transportation says we can fix them.Transportation secretaries normally don’t get the attention that Pete Buttigieg does. The current secretary and former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has become somewhat of a political lightning rod ever since his 2020 run for the Democratic presidential nomination.The status was made clearer after the Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, which led to calls that Buttigieg himself should be held accountable. “Ordinarily, transportation secretaries don’t go to active sites of crash investigations because that’s for the NTSB to do,” he said on the most recent episode of The Weeds. “But I did go to East Palestine because the residents there were getting so much misinformation, and I think were really questioning whether the administration was there for them.”

  Buttigieg’s department is also managing more everyday crises and disasters. Though it often fades to the background of our daily lives, access to transportation can be make-or-break for those striving to make their way out of poverty. According to the Urban Institute, only about 8 percent of Americans live near accessible public transportation. In 2016, 20 percent of those in poverty had no access to a car. Meanwhile, American roads are getting more dangerous. And when cars are on the road, they often become deadly. Last year, nearly 43,000 people died in traffic accidents in the United States, a number comparable to the number of gun violence deaths in the same time frame. “What I try to make sure of every day is that, if my profile is a little different than most transportation secretaries, that’s something that at the end of the day, we shape for the benefit of the agency’s ability to meet its mission,” Buttigieg said of the attention his tenure as head of the Department of Transportation has gotten. “If we can attract more attention to the issue of roadway deaths, if we can really get some facts out there about electric vehicles, if we can have an honest conversation about disparities in our transportation system and what to do about them, then there’s a chance to do a lot of good. But you’re right. It would be naive to ignore the political noise around all of this.”On this week’s episode of The Weeds, we sit down with Buttigieg in a wide-ranging interview on transportation in the US, including the future of public transportation and the policies that can curb traffic deaths.Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to The Weeds on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you get podcasts. There’s this debate between people who want systems to spend money to make it cheaper.  In Philadelphia, there’s a floated program for low-income people to ride free. In DC, we could all be riding the bus for free by the summer. And then there are those who argue that money should be used to improve service, making it more reliable, making it more frequent, rather than getting rid of fares altogether. Where do you stand when it comes to that conversation? I think the honest answer to your question is the jury is still out a little bit. And what I mean by that is we need to see more of the data that comes back through some of these efforts for fare-free transit. There’s an active debate with a lot of really important points being made on both sides. Are you going to invest it in free fares or are you going to invest in some kind of service improvement? Now, that’s not always as straightforward as it sounds, because sometimes [when] you do the free fare, you get more ridership that actually leads to more revenue. Another way that some communities seek to split the atom is means testing, so that lowest-income riders can get free fares, but that can be complicated to implement. This is the exact reason why we’re not trying to dictate any of that from here at the US DOT. We are closely watching these pilot programs, though, around fare-free transit to see what the results are and to see how that compares to the other strategies transit agencies are attempting. Transit agencies are under huge pressure right now, post-Covid. Commuting still has not reached a stable, permanent new normal, in my view. We’ve seen a lot of recovery, but not back to what it was like in 2019. And yet we know that transit is more important than ever, especially for those who count on it every day. And whether you ride transit or not, you benefit from transit in every respect, from the essential workers who count on it, to the fact that if you’re driving a car on the road, every person who’s on transit means a car that’s not on the road and means less congestion for drivers. So it really is a win-win, to say nothing of the safety benefits, because transit ultimately has better safety.Even in cities, people don’t always have access to transit. Only about 8 percent of the US population lives near public transportation. And you can compare that with 20 percent of the population in France. What do you make of expansions in cities? Should that be one of the priorities that these municipalities are making? I think the right answer is going to look different from city to city. And some places it’s got more to do with making the service you’ve already got be more frequent and more reliable. But yeah, there are other places where expansion could make a huge difference. I’ll give you just one example. In Chicago, there’s a neighborhood in South Chicago called Roseland, and that neighborhood within the city limits of Chicago has folks who [travel] almost an hour and a half to get to downtown Chicago to work. And the reason that stuck in my mind so strongly when I was there visiting with community leaders is that there is a town called Roseland, Indiana, close to South Bend, where I grew up, which is 90 miles east of Chicago. It takes about the same amount of time to get from Roseland, Indiana, to downtown Chicago if you do have a car as it does to get from the Roseland neighborhood of Chicago to downtown, if you don’t. You mentioned how mass transportation can help when it comes to road safety. And I briefly want to touch on that. Car crashes are a leading cause of death here in America. And last year they were up: over 9,500 people died in traffic crashes in the first quarter of the year alone. What are some policy solutions? How do we fix this other than say, “Hey everybody, drive better”? We should all be up in arms about roadway deaths in this country. As you said, about 10,000 people a quarter. That means about 40,000 people a year, which, by the way, is roughly equivalent to the number of lives we lose to gun violence in this country. And I think precisely because it happens so often, there is an attitude that it’s inevitable. It’s not. Our strategy has five elements: safer roads, safer vehicles, safer drivers, safer speeds, and a better standard of post-crash care. So when you do have a crash, the emergency response is in a position to make it less likely to wind up as a fatality. And we have to do all five of those things ... Some of it is behavioral, for sure, the choices that the drivers make. But a lot of it is design, and good design recognizes that humans make mistakes, but prevents them from being fatal. A good example to show you what’s possible here is our aviation system. We’re always making improvements to our aviation system. But think about the fact that we often have a year — more years than not — where the number of people killed in an airliner crash is zero. This is a form of transportation that has 16 million flights a year that involves people flying through the air at nearly the speed of sound. And almost every single time you have a perfectly safe arrival and return, in a way that is just completely different from what we have on our roadways. So we know that if we have the right attention and the right systems in place and the right safety checks, we could be saving so many lives. The recent rise [in deaths] appears to be plateauing. That’s what we’re seeing in the data that just came out. Stopping the rise is step one. But our goal, of course, is to reverse the rise. What’s caused that rise?Well, there are several factors that we think are at play. There was an unusual rise during the year of Covid, which is a bit counterintuitive because you’d think there was less driving going on, but with less driving, there were actually more opportunities for speeding on open roadways. What you often saw was people who were treating those freeways as railways. And so we need to have a future outlook where we have neither congestion nor danger on our roads. And that’s what we’re trying to design for. There are questions about the design of vehicles, vehicles that have technology on board that’s meant to benefit safety. But if you lean on it too much, it can have the opposite result. Think about the lane assist technology, for example, and the kind of cruise control that actually knows how far away you are from the car in front of you. In theory, that’s a safety boon, but not if you get so comfortable with it that you take your eye off the road and check your email. There is no vehicle you can get on commercially today where it’s okay to not be paying attention to the road. It is especially important as you hear some of the marketing going on out there. Just to be really clear, some of these technologies are exciting, but none of them — at least nothing available today to people buying a car — permit you to stop having your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road.

Israel’s new right-wing government is even more extreme than protests would have you think,2023-01-20,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:It’s also not a huge departure from previous ones.Nationalist, exclusionist, and far, far right: The most extreme Israeli government in the nation’s history has taken shape.The policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s newly sworn-in governing coalition brought out 80,000 protesters over the weekend in Tel Aviv. The protesters were largely focused on the government’s proposals to overhaul the judicial system, which could weaken the country’s democracy and separation of powers. But the effects of the policies on the 1.6 million Palestinian citizens of Israel and the 5.2 million Palestinians living in the occupied territories will be catastrophic, building upon years of policies that Israeli human rights organizations say constitute crimes against humanity.The human rights defenders and experts in Israeli politics I spoke with emphasized that this government is not a departure from previous ones — indeed, it’s Netanyahu’s sixth time leading the country. Rather, it’s a culmination of Israeli politics drifting farther and farther to the right, and decades longer of policies that amount to de facto annexation of the occupied West Bank, and policies of Jewish supremacy. What’s different now, however, is how clearly these ideas are stated in the new government’s coalition guidelines and by prominent ministers about the fundamentals of how the country runs.As US national security adviser Jake Sullivan meets Israeli and Palestinian leaders this week, there are serious questions of how the Biden administration will cooperate with an Israeli government that has scratched off its liberal veneer and thrown away any pretense of negotiations toward a Palestinian state. (Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to travel to the Middle East soon, too.) The new Israeli government is a turn from a brief centrist government last year, now seeking to implement policies that are anti-Palestinian and anti-liberal. But it’s certainly not the first Israeli government to do so. “It’s key not to pretend, as many seem to already be doing, that it’ll somehow be a sudden departure from Israeli quote-unquote ‘democracy,’” says Hagai El-Ad, executive director of the Israeli watchdog B’Tselem. “What worries me is that even this level of clarity will not be sufficient to trigger an adequate international response.” Israel’s parliamentary system of many fragmented parties has spelled collapsing governing coalitions and electoral turmoil, with five national elections since 2019. The “Change” government in 2021 brought together opposing parties last year to oust Netanyahu. But that fell apart last summer, and in the ensuing elections, Netanyahu built a coalition of ultra-Orthodox and religious Zionist parties that returned him to power, leading an even more extreme government. It was easy to foresee how the coalition would act: The new government’s ministers have made longstanding attacks on LGBTQ communities, religious freedom, Israeli and Palestinian civil society, and who can even call themselves a Jew. Above all, there will be drastic implications for Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank and for civil liberties for Israeli citizens, in large part because Netanyahu’s internal coalition negotiations have brought settlers into key ministerial posts.“They don’t have a lot of cracks in the coalition that could potentially derail some of the things that they want to do, and they have Netanyahu over a barrel,” says Jeremy Ben Ami, the president of the pro-Israel and pro-peace advocacy group J Street. “They passed a bunch of laws already before they were even sworn in as a government. They rearranged the way in which the occupation is run.” Days into the government’s swearing in, there are already signals of how these personalities will rule.Justice Minister Yariv Levin has introduced legislation that would weaken judicial review and the power of Israel’s supreme court to strike down legislation. Another proposal would revamp and politicize the country’s longstanding process for selecting judges.Or look at the first moves from the national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, of the Jewish Power Party. A provocateur whose political ideas are inspired by the late radical iconoclast Rabbi Meir Kahane, Ben Gvir has stepped into a role tailor-made to oversee the police both within Israel and the occupied West Bank. He’s already, in a dangerously escalatory move, visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. And in early January he, on dubiously legal grounds, directed the police to tear down any Palestinian flag in public spaces.There’s also Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The head of the Religious Zionism party, he is a settler whose anti-gay rhetoric is legion. He has already seized customs revenues that belong to the Palestinian Authority, an entity he’s called a “terror-abetting body” that he thinks should fall. He also holds newly created authorities that give him oversight of the West Bank occupation through a role crafted for him in the Defense Ministry.These rapid moves, particularly Levin’s judicial reform proposal, speak to the political infrastructure on the right that has been built over the last decade, largely funded by Republicans in the US. The Kohelet Policy Forum, a nationalist, libertarian Israeli think tank backed by right-wing American billionaires, reportedly drafted the legislation. As Ben Ami told me, “It’s not fully understood that this is being driven ideologically and professionally by a machinery that has its roots right here in the United States.”Further clues to how Netanyahu and his partners will govern are apparent in the coalition agreement that sets out the new government’s guidelines. Though it is not legally binding, it states plainly its ideology: “The Jewish people have an exclusive and inalienable right over all areas of the Land of Israel. The government will promote and develop the settlement of all parts of the Land of Israel — in the Galilee, the Negev, the Golan and Judea and Samaria,” the latter referring to the occupied West Bank. This goes further than any previous agreements. The government has made “explicit the coalition parties’ long-standing intent to further entrench Jewish supremacy and Palestinian repression throughout the State of Israel and the occupied West Bank through a two-tiered system of governance on all levels,’’ Israeli human rights organization Adalah writes in a report.The new government’s approach to the occupied West Bank constitutes the illegal annexation of Palestinian land, according to a coalition of leading human rights groups in Israel. The government plans to legalize illegal outposts built on private Palestinian land. The likely result, writes the coalition: “Palestinians stripped of rights and protections” and left “more vulnerable to violence and exacerbating the hardship they already endure.”“These changes” —  to the judicial system, and bestowing ministers like Smotrich with new authorities over the occupation — “threaten civil rights and individual rights in Israel, but it is mainly going to be a big, big issue against the national minority, the Palestinian citizens of Israel” who make up about 20 percent of the country, said Aida Touma-Suleiman, a member of the Knesset from the Hadash party. “We will be the first and the most severely damaged by those changes.”“This government has all the components of fascist groups,”  Touma-Suleiman added.The Biden administration has so far stepped cautiously. “We will gauge the government by the policies it pursues rather than individual personalities,” Secretary of State Blinken said last month at advocacy group J Street’s annual conference.Yet the US also appears to be holding out hope that it can work with Netanyahu and his ministers. “The prime minister, as he’s told all of us, has his hands very firmly on the wheel,” US Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides told Israeli TV recently. “He’s assured me we’ll work with the US government. Obviously, we have shared values. He understands the position of the United States, which is: we want to keep the vision of a two-state solution alive.”But the idea of shared values and of the two-state solution are in essence untenable with this new government. There are no negotiations happening between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the prospects for a sovereign and viable Palestinian state are further away than ever. Not just because of this new Israeli government, but in large part because of its many predecessors. It’s worth emphasizing that Israel has been violating Palestinians’ human rights with impunity for decades, and this new government just illustrates the most brutal intentions with greater clarity. “The hypocrisy is denying that Palestinians have already been living for many years under extreme, organized, criminal Israeli state violence, underwritten by the US,” El-Ad of the human rights group B’Tselem told me. “And the lack of accountability and the acquiescence of the international community is to a great extent responsible for driving this.”Last year was the most deadly for Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank since the United Nations began recording deaths in 2005, and it was also the year the most Palestinians have been held in administrative detention. The attacks on Palestinians throughout the center-right government of Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett cannot be understated. Beloved Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a US citizen, was reportedly gunned down by Israeli authorities while reporting in the West Bank. Israeli authorities raided the offices of six Palestinian NGOs, showing the limits of free expression in the country.The US has had a role here, too, as it continues to supply Israel with billions of dollars of military aid — and has failed to publicly criticize Netanyahu’s new political allies. “There’s no way that Netanyahu, as desperate as he is, would have gone to form this kind of coalition if it wasn’t for years and years of US abdication of responsibility for what happens here,” says Mairav Zonszein, an analyst covering Israel and Palestine for International Crisis Group. “He just wouldn’t have felt that he could do it. It would have been too outlandish.”Meanwhile, the US government carries on with some of former President Donald Trump’s Middle East policies, like building a new embassy in Jerusalem on land owned by Palestinians and pursuing further normalization deals with Arab states like Saudi Arabia.The Biden administration will only be able to carry on with a wait-and-see approach for so long. When US military materiel or dollars are being used to advance the policies so far only described by Israel’s new ministers, what will the State Department do? In a new commentary, Carnegie Endowment researchers Matthew Duss and Zaha Hassan recommend consequences for the Israeli government’s choices. That might include withholding US aid to Israel and avoiding acting on Israel’s behalf in international forums like the United Nations and International Criminal Court.The Biden administration is “clearly aware of the problem,” says Ben Ami of J Street. “But are they going to actually back it up in any way?” Touma-Suleiman, the Palestinian member of the Knesset, is not optimistic. “I have to tell you the truth. I don’t have a lot of expectations,” she told me. The Biden administration “might criticize, they might give messages, but I don’t see them doing more than that.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Why train derailments involving hazardous chemicals keep happening,2023-03-30,Vox,['Li Zhou'],"Filed under:In the wake of East Palestine, another train has derailed and caught fire in Minnesota. A train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in Raymond, Minnesota, on Thursday, the latest such accident in recent months. Thursday’s incident comes in the wake of a major train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio on February 3, when a Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals went off the tracks, spewing contaminants into the town’s air and water. Although train derailments involving hazardous chemicals are relatively rare, the occurrence of the Minnesota derailment so close to the Ohio one has raised questions about train safety and whether new regulations are needed to prevent more of these dangerous incidents from happening in the future. According to the Washington Post, there were 1,049 train derailments last year, and 10 train incidents that involved the spillage of hazardous materials, both figures which are lower than years past. The train derailment in Minnesota involved a 40-car train, 14 of which were hauling hazardous chemicals including ethanol, according to CNN. BNSF Railway, the company operating the train, says 22 cars derailed and four cars ignited and caught fire. Residents living within a half-mile radius of the accident were asked to evacuate as a safety precaution, though they were able to return home on Thursday afternoon. The train was also carrying corn syrup, and derailed around 1 am Central time. Ethanol is a potentially hazardous and highly flammable chemical, which can cause symptoms including drowsiness, nausea, and unconsciousness following exposure. At this point, it’s not yet clear what caused the derailment or what additional impact it could have on the surrounding area. According to the Kandiyohi County Sheriff’s Office, the fire at the crash site is being contained. While we still don’t know what caused the Minnesota train derailment, there are factors we know about that may contribute to rail accidents overall. Human error and track defects are two of the biggest causes of derailments, for example. In cases involving hazardous chemicals, equipment failures have also played a role in the past. These issues, broadly, may be compounded by staffing cuts railroads have made in recent years and their resistance to more costly equipment upgrades. “Rail workers, government officials, and industry analysts have long warned that such disasters are an expected consequence of an industry that has aggressively cut costs, slashed its workforce, and resisted regulation for years,” Vox’s Umair Irfan wrote regarding the East Palestine train derailment, which included 38 train cars carrying hazardous chemicals. As Irfan explains, there have been fewer train derailments over time, but one expert told him that those that do occur tend to be worse because companies have increasingly made trains longer. Trains increased in length by 25 percent between 2008 and 2019,  a decision that was aimed at reducing the staffing needed per car. “The accidents that do occur, because of the longer trains, tend to be bigger accidents — more cars and more potential damage,” Steven Ditmeyer, a former head of the office of research and development at the FRA, told Irfan. Additionally, there’s also been an increase in violations of federal rules meant to ensure the safe transport of hazardous materials. A USA Today report found, for example, that “federal inspectors have flagged 36% more hazmat violations compared with the five years prior,” though the uptick could be driven by greater reporting by regulators, who were called out in 2016 for lax enforcement. USA Today’s Jamie Fraser and Tami Abdollah add that most hazardous material spills from trains are caused by “equipment failure,” or “human error”: The most common reasons trains spill hazmat cargo are equipment failure, like broken valves, or human error such as improperly preparing cargo. Hazardous materials were released in 172 train derailments over the last decade, or roughly 17 each year. But when derailments involve hazardous cargo, the sheer size and amount of materials being transported can make wrecks dangerous and costly.Per an investigation from the National Transportation Safety Board, an overheated wheel bearing contributed to the train derailment in East Palestine. Irfan notes that there are changes in technology — including better detection systems for mechanical failures, as well as higher quality brakes — that could help trains avoid these types of accidents. In the past, however, rail companies have balked at some of these upgrades because of cost. Regulation on such issues has also been inconsistent based on the administration. Previously, the Obama administration required brake improvements for trains carrying flammable materials, but the Trump administration rolled that rule back. Recent accidents have led to discussions at the federal level about reinstating the Obama-era rules. Additionally, if companies shortened trains, accidents could be less intense, Ditmeyer said. And staffing could potentially play a role, too: Rail companies have slashed worker numbers in recent years, a cost-cutting strategy that has created the need for rail employees to work long hours in difficult conditions, an issue that was evident in a strike workers mounted last year pushing for paid sick days. Since the East Palestine derailment, lawmakers in Congress have sought more rail safety policies in order to prevent more incidents like this down the line. It’s uncertain how much these proposals would have done to prevent the Ohio accident or the Minnesota incident, but they would hold rail companies to higher standards including requirements for “‘well-trained, two-person crews aboard every train’ and around train length and weight, route selection, speed restrictions, track standards, maintenance, issue detection and more.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The Israeli election is over. It never mattered to Palestinians.,2019-04-19,Vox,['Hanna Alshaikh'],"Filed under:The election highlights how Palestinians are deprived of any voice.Center left or far right, the outcome of the Israeli elections largely did not matter to Palestinians. How could this be?Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won himself a fifth term in last week’s Israeli election. It’s not a surprise — the right-wing prime minister is popular in Israel, with a 52 percent approval rating, and his hawkish policies helped bring him to victory by shoring up far-right voters. This election was consequential to many. But for Palestinians forced to live under Israeli rule and mostly deprived of the right to vote, there is a widespread sense that Israeli elections make little difference in their lives. The population living in the increasingly Israeli-occupied West Bank and blockaded Gaza Strip knew that their struggle would not end even if Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud Party were to be ousted.Some in the United States held on to hope that a Benjamin Netanyahu and Likud Party loss at the polls to Israeli centrists, namely the Blue and White Party led by Benny Gantz, would help prevent further abuse of the Palestinian people. For many, Netanyahu appears to be the problem. But Palestinians know the problem far predates and will outlive the right-wing war hawk. Palestinians in the West Bank are living under the longest-running occupation in world history. Living under 11 years of blockade, Palestinians in Gaza struggle to survive. Palestinians displaced by Israel state builders now live in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, and dream of returning to their original lands, which is their right under international law. For these millions of Palestinians, there seems to be no acceptable avenue for their demands for political and human rights. These non-citizens live under complete Israeli control despite being unable to vote in Israeli parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, the status of Palestinian citizens in Israel — who make up 20 percent of the population — is not much better. While they do the have the right to vote, they are largely regarded as second-class citizens with severe limitations on their ability to develop their communities and live in full equality with their Jewish Israeli counterparts. Many recognize that when it comes to the question of Palestinian rights, the party platforms did not differ enough. It is no wonder that many chose to boycott the election, and that there was historic low voter turnout among Palestinian Israelis.Elections for the Israeli Knesset, or parliamentary, elections are not a referendum on ending Palestinian suffering. They are not a referendum on ending the blockade of Gaza, nor the occupation of the West Bank and the ever-growing Israeli settlements there, nor allowing refugees to return, nor granting full equality for Palestinian citizens of Israel. When it came to Palestinian issues, Israeli news coverage leading up to the election was not focused on each party leader’s approach to the so-called “peace process,” but rather debating which candidate could more efficiently and harshly clamp down on Palestinians. Netanyahu’s “centrist” opponent boasted about the number of Palestinians he killed as a military general and of bombing Gaza back “to the Stone Age.” We should also remember, it was under the leadership of a liberal, centrist party, Kadima, and its Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that the blockade of Gaza was instituted, and over 1,400 Palestinians were killed in the military campaign against Gaza in 2008-9, called Operation Cast Lead. For many Palestinians, the outcome of the 2019 Knesset elections did not matter, as the leading parties are in consensus on perpetuating the status quo.Last year, Israel passed the Nation-State Law, which explicitly names Israel the nation-state of the Jewish people alone, makes Hebrew its sole official language, and makes clear that Israel is not a state of all its citizens. Some saw it as a sign of Netanyahu’s nationalistic extremism. But it’s hard for Palestinians to see it as a sudden break from the past. For Palestinians, the foundation of Israel’s supposed democracy was built on our suffering through dispossession, ethnic cleansing, and discrimination. In 1950, Israel’s Law for Absentee Property declared lands and possessions belonging to any Palestinians who fled the violence of the establishment of the state of Israel as “absentee” property. These individuals either left temporarily, fearing the threat of being massacred, or were forcibly removed from their land, which the state then appropriated. How can a state that is proudly and unabashedly not a state of all its citizens call itself a democracy? The chain of events that has enabled a figure like Netanyahu to become so entrenched in Israeli politics is enshrined in the state’s history. Whether the sitting prime minister leaves or stays in power, it remains the case that Palestinians are unable to vote in favor of their freedom in Israeli elections. Perhaps another future is possible, one where a binational democratic state of all of its citizens exists in Israel-Palestine, rather than the current reality. Until then, a just peace for Palestinians and Israelis alike will not be achieved at the polls.Hanna Alshaikh is a Palestinian American researcher of the activist and intellectual histories of the Palestinian diaspora.

"The dire medical crisis in Gaza, explained",2023-11-06,Vox,['Li Zhou'],"Filed under:Gaza’s largest hospital was raided by the IDF. Others are struggling to stay open. Israel’s ground assault is causing a collapse of Gaza’s health care centers — including the region’s largest hospital, al-Shifa, which has been raided by Israeli forces. A group of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) fighters entered al-Shifa on Tuesday, after the hospital had been under siege for days. Care at the hospital had been shut down since Saturday, after it ran out of fuel. Health care officials and local journalists in the hospital have said that gunshots can be heard throughout the facility and that soldiers are actively interrogating people. One al-Shifa surgeon told Reuters that staff have been hiding during the raid and that an Israeli tank was parked in front of the emergency department. Israel has maintained that its focus on the hospital is due to claims that a Hamas command center is based underneath it, allegations US officials have echoed and which Hamas has denied. Israel says its forces battled with Hamas fighters outside the hospital, and that it’s discovered weapons and “terror infrastructure” inside it, a claim Hamas has also denied. The Israeli military also says there has not been fighting with physicians, patients, and civilians inside the hospital, though that has not been separately corroborated. Little reporting coming from the hospital has been independently verified, making it unclear exactly what is happening. The Israeli military’s raid of al-Shifa has also been condemned by some members of the international community — including Turkey and the United Nations —  who argue hospitals should not be military targets.Additionally, Al-Shifa’s not the only hospital damaged by the ongoing Israeli offensive. As of mid-November, Gaza’s Health Ministry says just 10 out of the region’s 35 hospitals are still operational. The situation is particularly dire in the north, which has weathered the brunt of Israel’s airstrikes, and where multiple facilities are facing “perilous” conditions. Like al-Shifa, al-Quds hospital, another of the largest medical facilities in north Gaza, has now run out of fuel, according to hospital and humanitarian leaders, with doctors scrambling to save remaining patients’ lives. In the few hospitals that are still open, physicians are missing critical supplies, understaffed, and overwhelmed, officials say. “It is a disaster from the top to the bottom,” Yara Asi, a professor of global health management at the University of Central Florida who has studied health care systems in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, said ahead of the most recent wave of violence. The need for quality medical care in Gaza has only deepened following weeks of devastating airstrikes by the Israeli government, which have killed more than 11,000 people and injured more than 28,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. These airstrikes came in response to a brutal attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, during which the Palestinian militant group killed 1,200 people and took roughly 240 people hostage. The ongoing siege that’s blocked all but a trickle of humanitarian aid has also exacerbated the negative health situation, leaving Palestinians struggling to find clean water and untainted food. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]Beyond the destruction they’ve caused to facilities and buildings, Israeli airstrikes have also overwhelmed hospitals with a surge of new trauma patients who’ve been grievously wounded and burned, and who have few if any options for treatment as doctors run low on antiseptic supplies, antibiotics, and anesthesia. In recent weeks, doctors described cleaning wounds with vinegar and laundry detergent, and operating on people without anesthesia. Hospitals have also become refuges for displaced people, making facilities already full of the ill and wounded even more packed. Some living at hospitals have taken advantage of “tactical” or “humanitarian” pauses in the fighting to flee south. But tens of thousands remain, and as fighting intensifies around hospitals, some are being killed and wounded. Beyond the danger posed by the fighting, medical experts worry that infectious diseases — such as cholera — will increase as people in Gaza are exposed to contaminated water and forced to shelter in cramped, crowded spaces. Already, some physicians in south Gaza have noticed an increase in infections including sepsis and meningitis among the patients they are seeing. “We’re running out of words to describe the horrors unfolding in Gaza,” World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news briefing in early November. “Hospitals crammed with the injured lying in corridors. Morgues overflowing. Doctors performing surgery without anesthesia. Thousands of people seeking shelter from the bombardment. Families crammed into overcrowded schools desperate for food and water. Toilets overflowing and the risk of disease outbreak spreading. And everywhere, fear, death, destruction, loss.”Of Gaza’s 35 hospitals, 25 aren’t operational, and a number of those that remain have been overwhelmed by a surge in patients and supply shortages. Smaller practices are in dire shape as well, with more than 70 percent of primary care clinics reportedly forced to shut their doors. Due to both dwindling fuel and damage from airstrikes, Gaza’s only cancer hospital, the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, ceased operations earlier this month, according to Palestinian health officials. The Indonesian Hospital, a major provider of medical care in northern Gaza, also saw its main generator go out in early November, severely limiting its ability to provide key services, including oxygen and ventilators. And this past weekend, both al-Shifa and al-Quds hospitals announced that their fuel had been depleted, and that patients and doctors were effectively trapped there as Israeli forces surrounded the two facilities. Al-Shifa’s shutdown — and the IDF raid — has endangered the lives of its patients, including  36 premature babies reliant on incubators to survive. Doctors tried to jury-rig solutions to keep them alive once those incubators went offline such as wrapping them in blankets to keep them warm. Israel claims to have brought “incubators, baby food, and medical supplies” as part of its raid, including machines that are battery-operated. Three premature babies who depended on these machines have died as of this weekend and more could do the same without additional support, a physician at the hospital told ABC News.For a time, the UN was able to keep some services at hospitals in the south afloat by sharing its fuel reserves, but the organization says it’s now out of fuel. The UN has warned that it may not be able to provide any more humanitarian aid at all, due to the lack of fuel available to move trucks and supplies. In addition to a dearth of fuel, Gaza’s hospitals are also lacking key medical supplies including everything from gauze to IV bags to antiseptic. “Even the most basic of supplies we’ve run out,” Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a surgeon in Gaza, told Australia’s SBS News. “We’ve run out of dressings, we’ve run out of intravenous fluids, we’ve run out of blade sutures. Anything that we require is finished or in the last few boxes left in the department.”MSF's Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan, talking about what hospitals in Gaza need: Fuel for generators.Clean water. Blood.When fuel runs out, every person on a ventilator, premature baby in an incubator will die. We need an immediate ceasefire.https://t.co/Ev866wFFSFAs their supplies dwindle, hospitals are also becoming more crowded with an influx of patients as well as other civilians seeking shelter after they’ve been displaced from their homes. “We are three surgeons — I’m an orthopaedic surgeon, we have another general surgeon and a plastic surgeon. We have more than 100 in-patients. We have people who need surgery but we can’t do this because of the limited resources,” Fadel Naim — of Gaza’s City’s last running hospital, al-Ahli Arab — told Al-Jazeera. “We do only [life-saving] surgeries. Every day we received more than 200 injured people. Some of them stay in the hospital because they have no homes.”“In terms of the patient load of hospitals, it’s indescribable,” says Tanya Haj-Hassan, a physician with Doctors Without Borders who is based in Jordan, but in regular communication with doctors in Gaza. “They’re having to resuscitate patients on the floor, to do surgical procedures on the floor because there’s no room anywhere else.”Hospitals have endured significant damage from repeated airstrikes and bombings, and they’ve also become a flashpoint in dueling claims from the Israeli government and Hamas. According to the WHO, there have been 137 attacks on health care-related facilities in Gaza, and at least 160 health care personnel have died while on duty. These attacks include airstrikes that were near the al-Shifa hospital, the al-Quds hospital, and the Indonesian hospital, as well as a bombing that hit an ambulance convoy near al-Shifa. Many hospitals in North Gaza have been told to evacuate due to bombings in the region, but physicians have previously said this is impossible and an effective death sentence for patients who rely on ventilators and life support. “Moving a baby on life support would be hazardous in a high-income country. Doing so in Gaza would gravely endanger a child whose life has only just begun,” said Ghebreyesus.Beyond al-Shifa, other hospitals, including al-Rantisi, a pediatric care facility, have also been at the center of competing allegations. The Israeli government has alleged that health care facilities have been utilized by Hamas and that this is the reason they are being targeted by the military. Hamas has denied these claims, as have hospital officials. The Israeli government’s claims also haven’t been independently verified. Prior to the raid, al-Shifa hospital director Muhammad Abu Salmiya said that the Israeli military has been “shooting at anyone outside or inside the hospital.” Similarly, Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns for the safety of its physicians near al-Shifa, saying in a Tuesday statement that bullets were fired into one of their locations close to the hospital where staff and families were sheltering. An IDF spokesperson had said there was “no siege” on al-Shifa Hospital and that the east side of the hospital was available for safe passage for those wishing to leave. Those inside, however, disagreed. “It is not safe to move out. It is not safe to stay. We don’t know what to do,” Nidal Abu Hadrus, an al-Shifa neurosurgeon, told NBC News. According to hospital officials, there were 700 patients, 700 medical professionals, and thousands of displaced people still in the hospital as of Monday. Unable to leave the grounds, hospital staff worked to dig a mass grave on Monday for 180 people who had died on its premises, NBC News reports.Hadrus says there have been efforts to coordinate with the International Committee of the Red Cross for an attempted evacuation, but it will be difficult to transport patients who are in fragile condition. Attempts to evacuate the premature babies at al-Shifa who rely on incubators have also been a focus of divergent statements from the Israeli government and hospital officials. The Israeli government has said that it would provide incubators for the babies and help to move them to a “safer hospital.” Al-Shifa Director Salmiya, however, disputed that claim as “completely false” on Sunday. The Israeli government has also said that it would provide 300 liters of fuel to al-Shifa, though hospital officials said it was left too far from the hospital for them to be able to safely retrieve, and that the amount would not be enough to keep vital services functioning for a substantial period of time.Other hospitals, including the al-Rantisi pediatric hospital and al-Quds hospital, have been targeted by the Israeli military due to alleged ties to Hamas as well, claims which also haven’t been independently verified. Monday, the Israeli military released images and video claiming that Hamas had used the basement of the al-Rantisi hospital to store weapons and hold hostages. The photos and videos showed guns and grenades in the space along with a chair with a rope near it, and a makeshift toilet. A Gaza medical official, however, said the space was used to shelter women and children, calling the IDF press release a “lie and charade.” The Israeli government has also alleged that Hamas fighters were using al-Quds hospital as a base to hide after launching rockets, something that the Palestine Red Crescent Society, a humanitarian organization, has pushed back on. Doctors and patients at al-Quds have also previously struggled to evacuate. Because of how intense the airstrikes have been in its vicinity, an emergency convoy headed to al-Quds to retrieve patients was forced to turn back earlier this week. Human rights groups have called out the airstrikes that have hit hospitals and cited the violence against health care facilities as violations of international humanitarian law. “The protection of newborns, patients, medical staff, and all civilians must override all other concerns. Hospitals are not battlegrounds,” UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said on X. As experts told Al Jazeera, attacks on hospitals are a breach of the Geneva Conventions, which state, “Directing an attack against a zone established to shelter the wounded, the sick and civilians from the effects of hostilities is prohibited.” There are exceptions if there’s evidence that medical facilities are being weaponized to harm an opposing force, however, though human rights groups have said their focus is on the fallout on civilians in these hospitals. “According to Israel, Hamas has chosen to set up a military base underneath the hospital. If that is the case, Hamas is committing a war crime that is morally reprehensible and absolutely prohibited under international humanitarian law,” said B’tselem, an Israeli human rights organization. “Even if there is a military facility operating under the hospital, this does not allow Israel to bomb the site. Such an attack would result in unbearable, horrifying harm to civilians and constitute a war crime — violating the provisions of international humanitarian law that Israel has repeatedly declared its commitment to uphold.” The WHO has emphasized, too, that “the difficulty here is separating the needs of [thousands of] people at al-Shifa hospital, civilians, doctors, patients, and others.” And even President Joe Biden issued a warning about attacks on hospitals on Monday, though it came after significant violence has already taken place, saying, “My hope and expectation is that there will be less intrusive action relative to hospitals.” Evacuations from these medical facilities — in addition to being physically challenging for those who are ill and injured— haven’t necessarily guaranteed safety, either, as Israeli airstrikes have increased in southern Gaza. Transporting the premature babies at al-Shifa outside of Gaza might be the only way to ensure their long-term safety, health officials have said. There have been some successful medical evacuations from Gaza into Jordan and Egypt, though the number pales in comparison to the need. A dozen pediatric patients with cancer and blood disorders have been evacuated, according to the WHO, as have dozens of other people with injuries and medical conditions. The fallout for patients from these hospital closures and shortages has been enormous — and is poised to increase. For patients with chronic illnesses, hospitals are increasingly unable to provide the vital medication and care they need to survive. “If you don’t have electricity, you can’t give dialysis [to patients with kidney illnesses],” says Haj-Hassan. “If you cannot do those things, you will ultimately become very unwell and die. [If] you can’t get cancer therapy, you will also die.”  For people with acute conditions, like a heart attack or stroke, there are limited medical resources — both when it comes to staffing and supplies — to be as responsive to these needs as before. “For acute problems, there’s just no capacity to care for anything that’s not a war injury at this point,” says Haj-Hassan. Care International told CNN roughly 160 people are expected to give birth in Gaza each day over the next month. Those pregnant people — including those who need C-sections — are among those who may be unable to secure the care they need. Data from Al Jazeera and the WHO also notes that there are 130 infants relying on incubators, 1,000 kidney dialysis patients, and 350,000 patients with noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease who have to bear these effects. And for patients with traumatic injuries — including thousands who’ve been injured during the airstrikes — it has meant incomplete treatments and little pain management. “How can you care for patients [when a] large part of their body is burned if you don’t have pain relief? It is completely inhumane,” says Haj-Hassan.On top of the existing patient needs, many experts worry about the spread of infectious disease as clean water supplies continue to run low and people continue to shelter in cramped spaces. Several thousand people were still taking shelter in al-Shifa as of mid-November, while the UN said 670,000 people were packed into its shelters. Asi pointed to a cholera outbreak that occurred during the war in Yemen and said a similar scenario could take place in Gaza. “[Water-borne illness] is one of the number one killers of children in Gaza even before this, and the potable water situation there has always been poor since the siege started in 2006,” she says. Infrastructure projects and general pollution limited the availability and quality of water before the war. Now, water is available, but it is untreated — full of salt from the Mediterranean and contaminated by wastewater and other pollutants.  Doctors, too, are completely overwhelmed by the degree of need they are seeing as well as having to make impossible decisions about who is able to receive care and use supplies. “What I’m hearing from speaking with them is just desperation that they can’t do anything,” says Asi. “The hospitals are to the point where they’re so full that when patients arrive, sometimes doctors have to choose between who we bring into the hospital, who may have a chance of survival, and who we can’t.”""Doctors are distressed. They are calling us crying...by the horror they are seeing…This has to stop.We're operating on children without anesthetics.We don't have morphine for them.""MSF's Leo Cans discussing Gaza on @cnni pic.twitter.com/az2ozu97SRThe WHO and Doctors Without Borders are calling for a ceasefire, the ability to provide humanitarian aid to hospitals, and security for health care providers in light of these conditions.

"If the Senate won’t convict Trump, ""Why is that bad for the Democrats?"" asks the Intercept’s Mehdi Hasan",2019-06-14,Vox,['Eric Johnson'],"Filed under:Even impeachment proceedings that fail to remove President Trump from office are better than nothing, Hasan argues on the latest Recode Decode.If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Mehdi Hasan is confused about Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s strategery.Hasan, who writes for the Intercept and hosts its weekly podcast Deconstructed, joined Kara Swisher on the latest episode of Recode Decode to talk about the state of media and politics, including Democratic leaders’ reluctance to impeach President Trump. Calling Pelosi’s public comments about impeachment to the press “ridiculous,” he said, “I think history will judge her very badly.“One of the assertions Pelosi makes for herself I find most ridiculous is, ‘He’s goading us to impeach him. He wants to be impeached,’” Hasan said. “No. 1, that’s absurd. The most thin-skinned president in US history, who wants to be compared to Abraham Lincoln, does not want his legacy to be, he’s up there with Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, and is one of only three men to be impeached.”Another argument against impeachment is that the Republican-controlled Senate wouldn’t achieve the necessary two-thirds majority to convict Donald Trump of impeachable charges and remove him from office. Hasan said that’s probably correct, “because Republicans are all profiles in cowardice,” but wondered why that’s such a bad thing to have on the record when one-third of the Senators voting are about to be running for reelection in 2020.“Why not put Susan Collins and co. on the defensive, Gardner on the defensive, and say, ‘Why did you vote against impeaching a man who clearly demonstrated he committed high crimes and misdemeanors?’” he asked. “Why is that bad for the Democrats? This weird kind of self-flagellating, self-loathing, ultra-cautious. Always, ‘What about Trump’s base?’ Fuck Trump’s base! What about your base?”The Democrats bring a knife to a gunfight. The Republicans bring a rocket launcher.”You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts, and Overcast.Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Mehdi.Kara Swisher: Hi. This Kara Swisher, editor-at-large of Recode. You may know me as someone who thinks SoulCycle instructors should just read mean tweets at you, but in my spare time, I talk tech and you’re listening to Recode Decode from the Vox Media Podcast Network. Today in the red chair is Mehdi Hasan, a columnist at the Intercept and the host of its weekly podcast Deconstructed. I’ve followed his work for a while. We’re going back to spend a part of this interview to talk about a podcast I did with Sam Harris back in May, which is how he got here. He said, “Why don’t you have another point of view?” And I said 100 percent, which I think will drive people crazy just the way they did the Sam Harris thing. Mehdi, welcome to Recode Decode.Mehdi Hasan: Thanks for having me, Kara.So I love your accent, by the way. I know people say that. I’m sure they say that to you. But in any case, I’m not trying to charm you.I’m a Brit in the US.I’m trying to make you comfortable before I attack.I’m a British journalist in the US and I keep getting compared to Piers Morgan, which is always painful.You’re nothing like Piers Morgan.I’d rather get compared to others but anyway...God, that asshole. Anyway, so let’s talk a little bit about your background. I’ll get into the Sam Harris thing later. But I did want to actually talk to you because you’re also someone who has very strong points of view on things. You’re a columnist. You do a podcast. You’re very active on Twitter. Talk a little bit about your background, how you got to where you are right now.So I’ve been a journalist for nearly 20 years now. I was in the UK until 2015. I’m British. People still ask me, “What’s the accent?” I’m like, “British.” I moved here in 2015. I worked for a bunch of media organizations in the UK. I was in TV for a while, and then I made the transition into writing and running my mouth. I always joke I literally have no skills apart from running my mouth. So it’s great being a journalist. I worked for the HuffPost in the UK. I worked for the New Statesman which is like the British version of the New Republic. I did political journalism there. And then just before the 2015 election, I moved out to the US for the 2015 UK election.Why?There’s a couple reasons. One was, I just enjoyed the challenge of doing something different. I was working ... My wife’s American. That’s the other part of the equation, and you know what they say: Happy wife, happy life. She did 12 years in the UK. Americans are two types. I find they either love England or they hate it. My wife’s a bit of a hater, not of the people, just didn’t really like the lifestyle. It was hard for her to transition. Always wanted me to move back to the US. I said, “What is a left-wing, British, brown, Muslim journalist going to do in the US media environment? Where is there a home for me?” So I dodged it for a while until I went to work for HuffPost and she said, “Now you work for an American company, AOL, move!” Arianna was very gracious to consider letting me move, but before I could do that, Al Jazeera English offered me an interview show in DC, which was a dream job. Sure.I thought I’ll go to the US for a couple of years, follow the Hillary Clinton presidency. It’ll be an interesting time. I arrived here shortly before the guy came down the escalator at Trump Tower to declare his candidacy and call Mexicans rapists.Among other things. So you were here to just do US politics?No, I still do a show.Right.I no longer work for Al Jazeera English, I work for the Intercept, but I still do a show for Al Jazeera called UpFront in Washington, DC, which is a weekly magazine interview show. It’s a global affairs, everything. But we’ve done lots of American interviews, which have gotten lots of pickup. I actually do everything. It’s fun.But you were ...One week we do the Kenyan foreign minister, the next week we do a Trump adviser.Right. But initially, you were here to cover the US politics.Yeah, initially, initially.Talk about that. Talk about what you were ...So I’ve always been fascinated by American politics, most British journalists are, especially those of us who are politics junkies. It’s very hard not to follow what’s going on on this side of the Atlantic. I was married to an American. I spent a lot of my time here visiting over the decades through the Clinton years, the Obama years, etc., etc.Yeah, I came right at the end of the Obama era thinking it would just be very, very straightforward. I mean none of us ... Well, most of us did not think this buffoon would win. It’s been fascinating because I’m still here, by the way, four years later. I thought I’d come for two years and to my mother’s great disappointment, I’m still here. Yeah. It’s just taken over my life, professionally and personally. Right.The Trump era just dominates my waking and sometimes sleeping moments. As a journalist, it’s — as you know better than me — it’s exhausting to cover this stuff.It’s meant to be exhausting.It’s never meant to be like this. I can’t believe any ...No. It’s meant to be exhausting. It’s meant to exhaust you. But go ahead. You’re right about this one.On this level, it’s something, just to say, I’ve just never seen anything like it. For me, I’ve just thrown myself into it for many reasons. Yeah, every time you want a day off, there’s a tweet, there’s a ... something happens, etc., etc. Yeah. I’m lucky because I have all these platforms. I mean, I’m very ... I shouldn’t complain. I’m in a very enviable position where I get to do podcasts, I get to do a TV show, I get to write a column for the Intercept, I get to run my mouth on cable news. So it’s fascinating. There’s so much to comment on. I always say it’s a great time to be a journalist, horrible time to be a human being. I’m also a Muslim immigrant in Trump’s America bringing up two daughters who are British-American dual nationals.Right. We’re going to get to that. And it’s very hard.We’re going to get to that. So what prompted you to want to do journalism in the first place?So I went to university in the late ’90s. I was at Oxford. I did the classic degree that politic junkies do, PPE, which ... With a PPE degree, you either go be a conservative prime minister like David Cameron or you tend to go work in banking or management consultants. I remember being in my final year at Oxford at Christ Church and thinking I don’t know what I want to do. Friends of mine were already on the track towards various consultancy ...Banking.Yeah. Graduate training schemes. My sister is a journalist. We’re both great disappointments to our Indian parents. My mother’s a doctor. My father is an engineer. It’s a cliché of South Asian parenting and neither of their children did science or engineering or medicine. So I thought, look, I’ll give this a try. It was either that or law, and law seemed quite hard. So I just went to work for ITV news, which is the British version of NBC News, as a news desk assistant. Just the lowly ... the lowest level of the newsroom. I thought I’d try it out. It worked for me because literally, I’m not trained to do anything else. Although, I always wonder, as you do, I give talks. I speak to students. As you … everyone wants to come and [ask], “how did you get into the media?” I just think, “I can’t give you any advice because it’s so different now.” Right. 100 percent.I would never get a job in the media today.Right. Yes, you would.I’ve got no skills.Yes, you would. I’ve got no skills.That’s not true.I’ve got no skills.Come on.I can’t do anything. You have skills.I’m a complete Luddite. I’ve been doing a TV show for 10 years. I have no idea how it’s made.You don’t need to know how it’s made. Do you know how your car works to turn it on and drive it?No. Don’t worry about it.I mean, I’m not a great driver. Don’t worry about it. All right. Then don’t drive.But that’s a different issue.All right. So what was the idea about how you wanted to do it? Because you have a much more ... just like a lot of journalists from Britain, it’s much more which is ... The US press has turned that way, become much more advocacy, much more personality based, much more point-of-view based.Yeah.Talk a little bit about that.So this is very interesting. The point-of-view point is interesting. You guys have cable news with these every night, people shouting at you or giving their opinions at you. Some good, some bad. I mean, the weirdness of Fox News apart for a moment. But you have cable news since Reagan got rid of the Fairness Doctrine, do whatever you want on TV. Then you have the very, very, very sober print press, over sober. I mean some of the headlines in the New York Times, you just want to kill yourself.Then we have the reverse because we have what’s called Ofcom in the UK, which regulates broadcast media. So you can’t do opinionated programming in the UK. You can’t have a Sean Hannity every night on British television. But you do have the British tabloid press, in particular, which is the equivalent of your cable news. The Daily Mail, of course, which many Americans now know, but also the Sun and the Mirror and ... Across the board very opinion ... the Guardian a very opinionated progressive ... but much more progressive in its editorializing than the New York Times.Sure.So that’s the kind of ugly stark differences. For me, the big difference that I felt a lot and I’ve been pushing this for a while is culturally there just seems to be this massive difference whereby — it sounds very patronizing and critical and I apologize in advance — but American journalists, especially political journalists, White House correspondents are way more deferential to people in power. It’s really weird because you guys had a revolution to get rid of the Brits, to get rid of monarchy, to get rid of all of that stuff. And yet, we in the UK, for all our many faults and sins in the British media — and I’m no fan of the British media either. You wouldn’t stand up in the room if Tony Blair or Theresa May or David Cameron comes in. In the White House, the White House press corps stands up if the president makes an appearance. I’ve made this point before. You get to keep your titles, which journalists seem fine with. You have guests coming on as Mayor Giuliani, Governor Romney, Secretary Clinton. Of what? They have not held those titles for years. This weird culture and the ... You see that in the Sunday morning interviews. Right. I would agree.They’re very softballs, friendly, the lack of a follow-up. It’s not as disputatious in media culture as you might like to think. Whereas American journalists withhold themselves. To get back to your earlier question, why did I become a journalist? I like to argue and the British media is definitely a space where you can have a good argument now.Right.We’ve told ourselves in the US, especially in recent years, how we’re polarized and there’s ... but actually when you scratch the surface, a lot of it is ...So you’re thinking...There’s a lot of consensus.Right. And a lot of avoiding of the big issues, a lot of dodging what’s in front of our face.What’s interesting is a lot of ... when you talk to an American journalist, they feel like they’ve gone too far. I don’t think they have.Yeah.I don’t think they have at all but ...The editor of the New York Times this week said he doesn’t like using the “lie” word because he doesn’t want it to look partisan, which is a bizarre statement to make on many levels but in particular in a climate where you have a president who’s told more than 10,000 falsehoods according to the fact-checkers. Yet that’s not partisan. Call a spade a spade.Right. I’m someone who in my journalism, whether in the UK or here in the US, has always used the L-word if it’s appropriate — lie – used the R-word if it’s appropriate — racist. And the American media still dances around both of those. Everything is “racially tinted,” “racially charged.” It’s racist. They feel they’ve gone too far. You know that.Yeah.They do. Yeah, I’ve seen the memos.In fact, they’re on ... for American journalists, the way they talk on Twitter now, for example, has become ... You and I are very forthright and we say the things we feel like saying. So I must be British. But most of them are saying things they never would have said before.Yeah. But it’s not our choice, as you and I discussed. If you’re a conservative or Trump supporter listening to this you’re saying, “Aha, this shows the liberal bias that we have complained about for years.” Actually, it doesn’t show that. It shows the exact opposite. You and I know that they’re not comfortable at all. The White House press corps would love to get back into an old relationship with the president and his press secretary. They would love not to be in conflict with the president and his press secretary. They don’t like the fact that they have to fight with Sarah Sanders. Remember, to be fair to journalists, defend my trade now, this is not their fault that their ... it’s not their fault that the president says mad shit on a daily basis and that they sometimes feel they have to point that out to their readers. Sometimes CNN has to put on it’s chyron that this is false. Nobody’s comfortable with that situation, I would argue in US media, including in the liberal media. Right.They don’t want that. You saw that with the whole White House press corps debacle at the correspondents’ dinner. It happened a couple years ago. Michelle Wolf the comedian called out Sarah Sanders in a very mild way, I would argue ...I would agree.... and everything she said has stood the test of time in relation to Sarah Sanders, who no longer even holds briefings. White House correspondents fell over one another to defend Sarah Sanders and throw Michelle Wolf under the bus. For me, that was a turning point. That was a reminder that these people are not equipped to deal with the era we are now in.Well, talk about the era we are in. How do you look at it now? In some ways that’s ... Trump’s been good in that regard. It’s pulled the ...There’s a silver lining to every cloud.Every now and then I’m like ... I was telling someone, so what’s a good thing to say about Trump? I said, “He questions a lot of things that I do think need to be.” Why don’t we view it that way? And of course ...A Trump supporter recently asked me at an event, “Why do you only bash him? Why can’t you say something nice about him?” And I said, “You first.” And she said, “He’s brought jobs back to the Negroes,” which led — literally — people in the room to do a double take. Oh my God!Economic anxiety. I would say, yeah, every cloud has a silver lining. I sometimes try and remind myself of the silver linings. One silver lining is this: Trump is so polarizing that he’s forced liberal centrists, cautious types to get off the fence and take a position. For example, an issue I care about greatly, the occupation of the West Bank in Gaza. Israel and Palestine and the US, never covered properly either in politics or in the media. It’s forced Democrats who would never dared to have taken openly anti-Israel government positions to really ... a combination of Netanyahu and Trump has forced them to move way to the left.I see that in candidates who would never ... you’d never imagine them in a previous election cycle to be saying the stuff they’re saying because ... Why? Because they feel they have permission to do it now because Trump is so brazenly in the Israeli corner or the Saudi corner. So that’s helped. When Trump takes a position, he taints it automatically. So the more positions he takes that I don’t like in a sense is strategically fine. When he said in his State of the Union ... when he did that whole thing attacking socialism I was like, “Great.” Socialism or capitalism, versus. It was just on Fox last week.But I was thinking that’s the best thing that’s ever happened to American socialists, getting attacked by Donald Trump. They probably got a membership spike overnight. So in that sense he is useful. But then I have still to remind myself, we’re living in an industry with hot takes and contrary takes. We can all do that. I can write a piece promising, here are all the good things that you don’t realize that happened because of Trump. Then I have to remind myself a bunch of kids were left in vans overnight.That’s right. I just think, sorry, this is a horrible, horrible moment and we’re only getting worse. Talking of Twitter, I just tweeted recently about Fox News is laying the groundwork for the shooting of refugees. Every night we’re being told about invaders, invaders. It’s only a matter of time.Someone just said in a previous podcast, I was talking Joi Ito, he was talking about machines and how the social media stuff that’s going on, and we’ll get to that. But one of the things he said that I thought was really interesting was that we’re in a horrible relationship with ourselves. I thought that was actually exactly right. We’re in a horrible relationship with ourselves, not just each other, but with ourselves, which I thought was an interesting point in time.In terms of our consumption of politics, news ...Everything. Just everything. Just across the board.Across the board. We’re in a horrible relationship. I’d like to break up with myself.I’m not going to flip back and forth.Okay.I’m going to go back to silver lining. And say when you say something like that, which is quite a stark statement.I’m just saying I thought it was interesting.No, no. It’s an interesting point. I would say look, I have to ... if I lose hope and I’ve got nothing left, I have to remind myself that actually, again, the silver lining to the Trump era, I’ve seen massive activism. I’ve seen people coming together in ways I never thought people would come together again. I have to remind myself as a Muslim immigrant that in January 2017, tens of thousands of people went out to airports to stop that original version of the Muslim ban. A Jewish friend of mine, we always laugh: Trump’s a great divider, yet he’s brought Muslims and Jews together. I mean, in a way that we wouldn’t think possible recently, where I’m writing joint op-eds with Jewish friends of mine about how the enemy’s against us all. We’ve got a common front. So yeah. It’s horrible, but it’s also forcing us to reassess ourselves. It’s forcing us to think again about issues we never really thought about that we took for granted. Yeah, this psychopath has blown everything up. So would you then call yourself a journalist or an advocacy journalist? The Intercept is sort of ... I mean, everybody’s an advocacy journalist in a way.Yeah. This is my problem. It’s like, who’s not an advocacy journalist? Is a New York Times White House correspondent who’s presenting not just a view of what the White House says but a view of how we should cover what the White House says, is he not advocating a position? Is he not taking a... Is he or she not presenting a particular line of thinking? This whole debate about the view from nowhere, I just ... I’m torn on whether — because the Britishness is still in me from the BBC, because I worked at the BBC as well — I’m torn on whether, do we just have everyone just put their biases on the table and then move from there? Would that be better? I don’t know the ... I can’t be confident and say the answer. Sometimes I think it would be preferable if everyone just ... we knew where everyone stood. Because the people who pretend not to have a view end up ... Go back to liberal journalist point. Liberal journalists, the media, I would argue they overcompensate. We see that. The conservatives have worked the media refs for years and we see that in the way that they bend over backwards towards any kind of implicit conservative criticism of their...I agree.They don’t give a damn about the left or both. They mock ...They’re playing us all the time.Yeah. All the time.Yeah. All the time. The left criticisms are ignored. I see that across the board. I think that’s a problem. I don’t think there’s any easy solution to any of this. I think this whole idea, to come back to your earlier point about people being uncomfortable, they don’t like it. I think that is a problem. I think, No. 1, whether you’re an advocacy journalist, a neutral journalist, whatever journalist, your job is to hold truth. Your job is to speak truth. The power of your job is to hold the powerful to account. Your job is to afflict the comfortable, comfort the afflicted. Cliché after cliché I can come up with. But that is your fundamental job. If you’re not doing that, you might as well retire and go do something else, be an accountant. Not that there’s anything wrong with being an accountant. But that is fundamental. In a Trump era, if you’re not doing that, then I’d just ... Okay. Okay.I mean, it’s just that there are kids dying, right, at the border. Oh, you’re doing the kids dying thing.Six kids. I’m going to do the kids dying.What can I say?I’m going to do kids dying. There are kids dying at the border and we flit around. By the way ...Yes. Okay. Right.Again, I don’t want to sound too negative about journalists. In defense of journalists, it is very hard to cover this president who produces 17 new scandals on a daily basis. I have to remind ... Trump years are like dog years. I have to look at last week and say, “Was that last week?”It was last week.It feels like it was eons ago.Yes.That Trump said that ridiculous thing. You’ve forgotten a lot of things.Exactly. You’ve forgotten a lot of things.Amy Siskind’s list. If you go back and look at the chapters again, wow. Wow. Exactly. We’re here with Mehdi Hasan. He’s a columnist at the Intercept and a host of its weekly podcast Deconstructed. Talk about that for a minute. Tell the listeners what you do.This is a podcast that we set up at the Intercept when I joined them ... The Intercept. Explain the Intercept to people.I love that. “Explain the Intercept.”Well, because people might not know it.The Intercept is a media organization based out of New York. I’m in DC, in the DC bureau.Funded by Pierre Omidyar. Funded by Pierre Omidyar, eBay man. What is he 40th, 50th, 60th richest man in the world?He’s rich.No, he’s very rich. And he lives in Hawaii.He founded eBay. He does.Which is kind of cool. He lives in a very modest home in Hawaii.I’ve never been to Hawaii. I need to go to Hawaii. It’s on my list of places to go in the universe.It’s lovely.The Intercept set itself up, it was mainly known as national security journalism, whistleblowers, leaks. It was set up by Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras as a way of getting the Snowden archive out, building on the stories that they’ve broken. The Pulitzer Prize they later won for it. I think then it came up with a very specific ethos of adversarial journalism, what we were talking about earlier, about not just sitting on the fence, but calling a spade a spade. Saying, speaking uncomfortable truths, not trying to be popular. Over the years, it’s morphed. I joined it a couple years ago. It’s very interesting now because Politico recently did a profile of the Intercept and Ryan Grim, our DC bureau chief, about some of the political journalism we bring, the space that’s occupied in the Democratic primaries has been fascinating. The Intercept was covering Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ...Very close to her.... before anyone else had even heard of her.Yeah.My colleagues Aida Chavez and Ryan Grim were out there covering her and others well before anyone else. So it’s been an interesting space and the political space it’s been occupied. I think Politico sold it as we’re some player in the Democratic civil war, which I think was slightly overheated. But yeah, we take great interest in what’s happening on the left of political journalism. We take great interest in breaking stories. Ryan breaks some great stories. My colleague Alex Emmons has been covering the war in Yemen long before it was fashionable for anyone to say, “Why the hell are we supporting this horrific war in Yemen?” So yeah. We’ve tried to carve out some interesting niches in national security, whistleblowing, Democratic party politics, foreign policy. I do this podcast for them called Deconstructed. For me, it was really interesting because I wasn’t a big podcast listener when it was pitched to me. I do TV shows. I do two shows for Al Jazeera English, which are very serious, heavy interview shows, where I basically grill people. That’s what I do. That’s what I do. It’s a very tough, robust interview format. For the podcast, I have to change the style. Some people are still disappointed, like, “How come you’re not the guy from TV?” It has a very different format, as you know when we’re talking. So I try to have much more of a conversation, less of kind of bang-you-over-the-head, or a ...Score the win. Score the win. Not that I would ever say that I was trying to score a win on my TV shows, although Erik Prince may take a different position. It’s like a boxing match. Those are sometimes … Yes, that was a great interview. That was a very interesting interview. Talk about that one, just briefly, and then we’ll get back to the question. Erik, I mean, it was a ...Erik Prince is the brother of ...? Betsy Devos, the education secretary. He was famous before her. Infamous before her, because he founded Blackwater, the infamous mercenary company, who has employees ...Very wealthy family.Very wealthy family from Michigan, kind of Christian fundamentalist. A company accused of very racist and violent policies. Killed a lot of innocent Iraqis in various massacres. He came on my show at the Oxford Union called “Head to Head”, where we talked, where for one hour we went back and forth. I also managed to pin him down over some lies he told to the House Intelligence Committee. They’re now investigating him and seeing if there’s a case to do him for perjury. The question everyone’s asked me about the interview, “Why did he come on your show?”I like that he did. I don’t know the answer. I do like ... I admire anyone who comes on that show, because it is a one-hour intense interview in front of a live audience. It’s not a Sunday morning chat show, and I think, I admire him for doing that, but I wouldn’t have done it if I was him, and I don’t think he quite prepared for the interview, or thought or knew what was going on. I can’t answer why he did it. Maybe, you know, people do it for different reasons, but I’m used to doing that format, and then we decided to do a different format, which is the podcast. It’s been great to have common ... because on that format, I never get to have people who I agree with. People will pitch people, and I’ll say, “But what would the interview be? I’d just be going, ‘Yes.’” So now on the podcast, I get to have interesting people who I like and agree with, whether it’s colleagues of mine, like Naomi Klein coming on to talk about climate change, whether it’s Bernie Sanders coming to talk on oligarchy, Elizabeth Warren talking about corruption. We’ve had Riz Ahmed, who I went to school with, the actor, coming on talk about Islamophobia and racism and diversity in Hollywood. It’s been some great conversations, as you know better than me. You’ve had even more on your show than I have.One of the reasons you’re here is because of the conversation I had with Sam Harris about Islam. Obviously, Sam is a very controversial figure around issues around Islam. He’s made a series of declarations that many people agree with. Many people don’t agree with. Talk a little bit about that, because that’s something you do cover a lot.Yes. I do cover Islamophobia a lot, although it has become fashionable these days to go, “Are Muslims the victims?”Yes. ”They always want to play the victim card.” I would say, “I can assure you, if I could pick a career plan that didn’t involve talking about this, I would.” There is nothing great about the Islamophobia beat, especially when you’re Muslim. Right, right. It’s depressing to cover this stuff. You and I were talking before about some of the comments. I don’t really go below the line. I don’t read comments anymore on social media. I have to be careful when I read my timeline. There is mass Islamophobia out there. Yes, you get it. You know, people are losing their minds in a way that ... I’ve been following this since 9/11, and you look at the Pew data. Pew did a study and found that there are more anti-Muslim hate crimes today, than there were after 9/11. I mean, it’s actually much worse now, and it’s gotten worse. I’ve seen it get worse in front of my eyes. So, it’s deeply depressing what’s going on in terms of anti-Semitism. I fear for the worst in the future. I think it’s only going to get worse before it gets better. I hope there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, but the tunnel is a very long and dark tunnel. So yes, I cover this stuff. I try and call attention to it, both because it’s the right thing to do and obviously for self-preservation reasons. But it’s not just Islamophobia. We are living in an age of rising Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. In fact, some of the people doing it are doing both, including, I would argue, this president, but also, the men of violence. There’s no coincidence that the guy who attacked the San Diego Center more recently bragged about attacking a mosque beforehand.The same with the guy in New Zealand. One study by Gallup found in the US, if you hold significantly prejudiced views towards Jews, you’re 32 times more likely to hold significantly prejudiced views against Muslims. So, Jonathan Freedland and I, my friend and Guardian columnist, we wrote a piece together saying, “Come on! Let’s get on the same page to stop all this crap. The white nationalists want to kill us all.” If that’s not going to get us focused, then I don’t know what is. But the problem is, while it’s easy for liberals to come together and say, “Ah-ha! There is the Nazi, the skinhead. There is the Trump supporter in the MAGA hat, and there is Donald Trump himself saying Islam hates us,” and all the other nonsense that he says, that’s much easier to identify. Since 2017, to be fair, lots of people have now woken up to kind of, “Oh! Islamophobia is real,” because before 2017, I was encountering people who said, “It doesn’t even exist. It’s all a myth. You’re just making it up.” Now, we’ve kind of moved beyond that, because it’s so brazen and blatant from the most powerful man in the world. But the bigger issue for me, which I try and push politely and reasonably sometimes, sometimes not, is the liberal side of the equation. It’s easy to pin it all on the right and the far right. Right, right. Absolutely. Islamophobia is both institutionalized and it’s kind of a form of an unselfaware cultural bigotry that we all imbibe, and there’s even internalized Islamophobia when you talk to scholars or Muslims who have these views about other Muslims, because they’ve absorbed so much media coverage and Hollywood movies and political rhetoric that we can’t ... We’re not immune from it, either.I think that’s what I try and challenge a lot. That’s where people like Sam Harris pop up on my radar, because people are telling me, “Oh, he’s a liberal. He’s a liberal. He’s not here. He’s not a racist. He’s not in the Trump mold.”He doesn’t like Trump. ”He’s attacking the ideas.” Or, he was telling on your show, “No, I don’t think anyone hates Trump more than I do.” It was a very Trumpian statement, I thought it was quite funny. And he says ... yes, loads of people hate Trump more than Sam Harris does. This idea that him and Richard Dawkins and others, the quote-unquote “New Atheists,” they are attacking the idea of Islam and “no idea should be…” and it’s just bullshit, because if it was that, I really wouldn’t care. If you want to ... if you carry ... you call me on the show and say, “Let’s talk about the afterlife.” You telling me it’s absurd about resurrection, I’ll have that conversation all day long. You want to talk to me about prophethood? What’s the point of prophet...? Let’s do it. Funny, none of these guys ever actually want to talk about the ideas or theology. When you break it down, it is about the people. It is about the demographic trends ...And not the religion. ... and Sam is a classic example of that on your show. He says, “Islam, Islam, Islam.” I’ve confronted him on social media — he’s run away — with his own quotes. With his quotes, which he always says are out of context, with all the links and the context of where he said outrageous things about Muslims. About Muslims, not Islam. Things that if Donald Trump said, every liberal would lose their mind, but for some reason, Sam Harris and co. get a pass. That for me is a problem. So when he says, “Muslim immigrants bring their backwardness to Europe,” when he says that, “The left are okay with white women being raped by Muslim immigrants,” which is what he said in 2016, that’s an outrageous statement.So what happens then is you became engaged with ... in this kind of thing, is they pull up your quotes. Talk about that. Which is funny. So yes, in my 20s — and I’m 40 this year — in my 20s, I used to give talks to Muslim students, Muslim groups. I have a big mouth. I like to run off. People ask me to speak, I speak. In some of those talks, I said things that I deeply regret, partly because I just phrased it badly. You’re just running your mouth. Out of context. Not even out of context, just phrased badly. I mean, there’s some things out of context, definitely. So, I’ll give you an example. Okay. Sam Harris used to try and attack me, which is just funny because a) I’m saying they were bad and I’ve disowned them. He refuses to say he did anything wrong, so I don’t understand how it’s an analogy. It’s so frustrating. Yes, so for example, what is it? Oh! “You say, ‘Non-Muslims are cattle.’” I gave a speech where I quoted a verse of the Quran, that people who don’t believe in God are unthinking, like cattle. It’s a metaphor. I also said Muslims who follow the crowd, who follow, have a herd instinct, are like cattle. That isn’t out of context, because he clipped it. It’s only non-Muslim, sounds like I’m calling them. On the other hand, did I make remarks about homosexuality that I regret? Hugely, big time! I was talking about Muslim history and I was quoting Islamic scholars saying all sorts of bad things, where all of these quote unquote, all of these things are put together, right? Different sins, that you know what classical Islam, classical Christianity, classical Judaism thinks of homosexuality. Now, 10, 15 years later, do I hold to it? Of course not. What’s annoying is, you look at the body of work of my journalism. My journalism is on the record, right? I wrote a piece recently about Brunei. It’s interesting, I would argue, that some of us played a role in helping the ludicrous, odious Sultan of Brunei pull back from his absurd death penalty for gay people, for gay sex. I wrote a piece for the Intercept, saying, “This is not Islamic. This is not in my name. This is absurd.” I’ve been saying this for years. I wrote a whole piece about homophobia and how Muslims can tackle it, because it’s not easy. I’m not going to throw Muslims under the bus, either. This is centuries-old doctrines, practices. I’m on multiple WhatsApp groups with leading Muslim scholars, actors. I’m grappling with this, especially in the West. How can we throw our gay brothers and sisters under the bus when they’re the first to stand with us against Trump and bigotry? These conversations are being had. On the other hand, the text, the scripture is clear that this is a sin. So, these conversations are ongoing. I’m not a scholar. I don’t claim to be an Islamic scholar. I wish it was an easy subject. But, did I say things I regret? Of course. My No. 1 issue right now, today, is not about theology or religion. That’s for other people. My issue is we cannot afford to demonize and dehumanize other people. That is, for me, is a bottom line. Except, that’s what happens when you get in this media. Talk about the media because you ... the back and forth and you and him is just riveting, but it’s also disturbing. Because that’s what people do: they tit-for-tat. Look, I like to be robust. I like to be robust. I’m not going to pretend that I’m some great, polite, friendly ... No, I do tough journalism. Right. I swear. I am tough. I ask tough questions. I don’t fall back. But I’m talking about in the Twitter setting. I’m just using Twitter as an example.Yes, Twitter makes everything worse. There’s no debate about that.Yes, that’s what I mean. Right. There’s no debate. I remember I went see Glenn Greenwald in Brazil.He loves to use the Twitter.He loves to use the Twitter, but anyone who knows Glenn will say the same thing. But in real life, he’s very different to Twitter. My friend Owen Jones in the UK, who’s kind of a massive Guardian left-wing columnist, is always fighting with people because he’s one of the only lefties out there defending Corbin, defending socialism. Same issue. People meet him, and they’re like “Wow! You’re like the nicest guy, totally different to your Twitter persona.”Oh, I hate that argument. “He’s nice, he’s okay,” whatever. But it’s true. I’ve seen this. I said, you meet people and yes, Twitter brings out some of the worst of us, especially those of us in the middle of a fight all the time. You are ultra defensive. You’re in the middle of taking on 17 different people. The 18th says something mildly innocent and you shoot them down and they think, “Wow! What a prick you are.” And actually, that’s not what really would have happened in real life. Right. I was talking to a friend of mine earlier about, you know, it’s much easier to talk about things in person, when you have a disagreement with a friend or colleague. Sure. Absolutely. Texts, DM’s, tweets, WhatsApp, it just doesn’t work. That said, I’m addicted to Twitter, to my wife’s great complaint. I love it as a medium. It suits me. It’s where I learn a lot about the world. Do you think it’s damaging? I’m going to get you in to tech a little bit. Hugely damaging.And what to do about it then? Hugely damaging, but you love it. It sounds like you’re like a crack addict. So all I can say, I’m an addict. There’s no debate about that.Right. Right. It’s literally ... I went on pilgrimage, and I wasn’t on Twitter for a while. It was really hard. People thought I had died, as I hadn’t tweeted for a few days. I talked to my wife about my kids, you know, kids on devices. All I can think is like, “Don’t do what I did. Do as I say, and not as I do,” because I think it’s too late for me, but I think ...Well, talk about its effect on politics. It’s coming, because you yourself are engaged in the arena, such that it is. Sam is. So is everybody. So is everybody. Is Sam engaged? I’m not sure he’s that engaged. Yes, he is. I think he uses it more as kind of a grande style, to kind of broadcast.Let’s move away from Sam, or whatever. Lots of people are. Fine. Like you, for example, after that Sam show.Sean Hannity uses it a lot. You, after that show with Sam, you engaged with a lot of people in good faith.Yes, I did.I don’t think Sam or some others do that. I think to engage in good faith, with people criticizing you in good faith, I think is a great part of Twitter. I think Twitter has allowed me to meet people and talk to people, both members of the public and celebrities, politicians, who I’ll never get to meet otherwise. And for that, I will — you know, clichéd — be grateful to Twitter. I don’t think I would be, professionally, I generally don’t think I would be where I am today, were it not for social media.Okay. So what is the ...But, it’s hugely distracting. It doesn’t help me in my personal life at all. What is the impact on politics and then journalism itself?  In what sense? I mean, there’s so many different facets. What do you think it does? It creates a twitchy, hot-take mentality where you forget the last thing. Yes, it definitely creates the hot-take, militant...You came in today. You were like, “I can’t believe what ...”Yes, what Trump just tweeted. Yes. It’s so much.... Trump just tweeted,” but yesterday, it was something else that was misspelled.Exactly. That’s true. Well, there’s a big question. If you take Trump out of the equation? He’s so out-sized and oversized in this whole conversation. He’s so dominant on Twitter in particular. If Trump didn’t exist, would it still be the same? Would a President Hillary Clinton still ...No. No, and I don’t think we will ... Obviously, Twitter would still be doing it, but I think the way he dominates social media ...I’ve written about this a lot, yes. ... is slightly different, and I think that makes it kind of ... he’s sui generis in that way. Mm-hmm. But yes, for all of us, it’s the hot-take culture. There were things I used to ... would have written an op-ed about or I would have wrote an essay about, which I do a Twitter thread on, and my editor will say, “Why didn’t you write that as a piece?” “It’s done.” It’s done? It’s already had a thousand ... I can’t write now. I can’t self-plagiarize off my tweets. It’s in 16 parts! Yes, I did. I did this amazing thread. It’s all being shared. So, that is a problem. You know, we do stupid things in micro-ways, but then again, that also has an advantage. The instant take also helps. It helps draw attention to a story. It helps cause genuine outrage. Sometimes, you should be outraged. If you’re not outraged right now, what the hell are you doing? So, in that sense it’s good. I do think the way that politicians have been able to use it to bypass the media is problematic. In one sense it’s democratic, because you could talk to your constituents, which is great in theory. But the reality of, especially in the reality of US politics on the right, is it has been used to create this entire infrastructure of ...Sorry to point out, AOC is doing the same thing, and beautifully.I don’t think she’s purveying fake information. Oh, no, no. I got that. I don’t think she’s questioning reality. I’m talking about the fact of using it as a propaganda tunnel to basically say ... so, the New York Times breaks a story about Congressman X being corrupt with copious evidence. Congressman X takes to Twitter, and says, “Fake news. You can trust me. New York Times are lying.” They wouldn’t have been able to do that 5, 10, 15 years ago. Now, that genie’s out of the bottle. And I’m not saying we should put it back in the bottle. I think that’s a fundamental problem for those of us who cover politics and want to hold people to account. Trump knows that. He says this openly, “They hate me because I can bypass all of them and talk directly to my base,” which is true, and he misleads when he does it and there’s no way of checking that. You can’t censor him on that, obviously. Again, it’s really problematic that we have no ... I’m very old-fashioned. This is my age showing. I did like an older ... when I was growing up, when you had the water cooler moments, when everyone would watch the same news. So, you’re saying you’d like it to go back?I’m not saying I’d like it to go back, because I’ve just told you the things I love about Twitter. But, you know, it’s complicated. I do miss that sense where everyone could come together for a moment. And be reflective. Be reflective, but also having seen the same stuff. Right. I mean, we live in an age where literally 30 percent of the public in this country are not watching or reading what you and I are watching and reading. I don’t know how democracy survives in that. Where are we going now then? Here we are. It’s been kind of a disastrous mess. It continues not to correct itself in lots of ways. Are there corrections? No, there’s no corrections. The other night, there were four things the Trump administration removed. I was like, “What?” It was sort of like, it just doesn’t end. And we’re going into this election with the Democrats sort of all over the place. We’ve got impeachment hanging over things, or maybe not. We’ve got Trump saying he’s won already, essentially. You know, there’s questions whether he can. There’s polls that say he can’t win. There’s others say he can. I’m kind of worried if he doesn’t win, what’s going to happen?That’s what I’m most worried about, and I’ve written about that. I don’t think he’ll leave quietly. No. Exactly. I don’t think he’ll accept the result, and I don’t think we’ve prepared for that. Again, to come back to our earlier conversation, I don’t think White House correspondents sat around and talked, “How are we going to cover next November?” They don’t want to think about it, even though they all know. We all know. It’s like I say, the media coverage of Trump is like the emperor’s new clothes. We all know it, though very few of us are willing to be that child who calls it out. Right. It’s as if, for example, his mental stability. That should be the No. 1 story. Well, a lot of people have written about that. George Conway, a right wing? Exactly. Exactly. A right-wing husband of a White House aide. Someone who’s conservative, not ... He’s not right wing, well, conservative. He’s Federalist Society, I would argue, right? Like everything’s moved now. If you’re not a far-right Nazi, you’re right wing.Someone at a party was like, “Oh, I love ...” It was Rick what’s-his-name, the guy who used to work for McCain.Rick Wilson. It was Wilson, and someone else at the party who’s a little more left was like, “He was never nice to me.” It was a person of color. “Never nice to us, and wouldn’t be if he was back in power again. So why are we liking him?” And it’s because he’s not ...Why does George Bush get a hug from Ellen?I know. ... and swap cough drops with Michelle? Everything’s relative, right? Trump is so far right, and he’s made ...It was funny. Someone’s like, “Oh! Reagan is so good.” I’m like, “No, he was not. I am certain of the people who had AIDS did not think that. I recall, because I was around.”The late, great John Kenneth Galbraith famously said about George W. Bush that, “He makes me yearn for Ronald Reagan,” and I used that line in a New York Times op-ed. In 2015, I said I yearned for George W. Bush. I hated George W. Bush. I marched in the Iraq War as a young guy. But yes, I look at Bush ...It’s true. The things have moved. Things have moved. Things have moved. So, talk about what’s coming. I think you have to separate out the Democrats. That’s the presidential race, which is kind of in its own bubble. Debates kicking off, it’s starting to get serious. Hopefully, we’re whittled down from the kind of 776 candidates who are currently running. Then, there’s the House Democrats and Nancy Pelosi, who I’ve been very critical of. Right. I think I wrote a piece in November saying she’s not ... she and Chuck Schumer, let’s be fair, not just her, a lot of misogyny only focuses on her. Schumer as well. Awful. Perhaps more awful. Well, she controls the House. In terms of general, congressional leadership of the Democrats, they’re both not the right leaders for the time we’re in. I don’t think they get the scale of the challenge. We have a white nationalist in the White House, kids dying at the border, and they want to talk about Infrastructure Week. I find that odd, to say the least. Pelosi on impeachment, unless she changes tack, I think history will judge her very badly. I think the arguments against impeachment are ridiculous.All right, go for one. Defend one of them. They have all these marginal seats that they have to keep. I think about 46 of them that could be in trouble if they focus on impeachment.Where’s the evidence that they’re going to be in trouble? I’m just saying they’re worried about that. I haven’t seen that. There’s a lot of assertions being made.Right.I’ve not seen evidence for this. For example, one of the assertions Pelosi makes for herself I find most ridiculous is, “He’s goading us to impeach him. He wants to be impeached.” No. 1, that’s absurd. The most thin-skinned president in US history, who wants to be compared to Abraham Lincoln, does not want his legacy to be, he’s up there with Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, and is one of only three men to be impeached. Yes, he is still mad about the inaugural crowds, isn’t he? Yes, the idea that he’s okay ... Yes, and he’s complaining and Fox News and Normandy about Nancy Pelosi saying he should be in prison. The idea that he wants to be impeached is absurd. Anyone who knows anything about his psyche, absurd. But even if that were true, no evidence is offered. It’s just stated as fact. I just don’t buy that. A lot of these statements are made, for example, “Oh well, the Senate won’t convict.” Probably won’t convict, because Republicans are all profiles in cowardice, but on the other hand, you’re going into 2020 Senate elections, which actually, they’re not. Whatever happens, and they’re not great for the Democrats. There’s not a good lineup. Why not put Susan Collins and co. on the defensive? Gardner on the defensive, and say, “Why did you vote against impeaching a man who clearly demonstrated he committed high crimes and misdemeanors?” Why is that bad for the Democrats? This weird kind of self-flagellating, self-loathing, ultra-cautious. Always, “What about Trump’s base?” Fuck Trump’s base! What about your base? Right? This is just the Democrats ... You know, it’s been said often enough, I’ll say it again. The Democrats bring a knife to a gunfight. The Republicans bring a rocket launcher. That has always been the way it’s been, and unfortunately under Pelosi, yes, she’s great at clapping snarkily at him, but in terms of actually using the strongest power that she had ... She said recently that he’s not a well man. He’s got problems. She alluded to his insanity, and then she said, “I wish his administration, I wish his staff and his family would stage an intervention.” I wanted to shoot myself in the head. You are the House speaker. You can stage an intervention! It’s called impeachment. The idea that the fate of the Republic is in the hands of Mike Pence, Ben Carson, Melania Trump, and Barron Trump is absurd. Right? But that’s what she said, and she’s supposed to be this political genius. So, what do you expect is going to happen then? I think predictions are a mug’s game. All right, but she looks like she’s not moving in any way.At the moment, I don’t think she’s going to move, and in knowing what we know about the Democrats, I’ve talked to some House Democrats who say, who are up for it, but then it’s like, you don’t realize behind the scenes how many are not up for it. Just so wanna avoid it and talk about Infrastructure Week. Because they just don’t get the time we’re in, and because they have these weird kind of calculations about elections. There’s this idea that public opinion is frozen. The biggest argument is, the public doesn’t want impeachment. Well, they didn’t want impeachment when Nixon was impeached, either. In fact, the majority of Americans only supported Nixon’s impeachment two weeks before he resigned, after articles of impeachment were written by the House Judiciary Committee. See, the idea that you can’t change public opinion, that the job of Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer is not to lead public opinion in a direction, seems to be ...But there’s never been a ... ... a complete abdication of responsibility.But Nixon was never quite as defensive of himself as Trump is good at. You know what I mean?Oh, I’m not saying it won’t be harder, of course it’ll be harder.Right. I mean, Carl Bernstein made the point, if we broke Watergate today, it would just be “fake news.” You didn’t have Fox News in the ’70s. You didn’t have all the social media that we’ve talked about. No doubt it would be hard. There’s an argument, “Oh, it’ll be hard,” or, “It will rile up his base.” They’re already riled up! He just turned them on Ilhan Omar recently, before, and Colin Kaepernick. Next, it’ll be “doctors killing babies.” He doesn’t need impeachment to rile up his base. This guy can produce enough racist, obnoxious, dishonest tropes to rile them up. For me, the arguments are all kind of not really there. The only argument that has any weight is that, “Oh, he won’t be convicted in the Senate, and therefore he’ll say he was exonerated.” I’m not sure I buy that argument. Also, the idea that by not impeaching him, that doesn’t have a cost, that he’s not ... Harry Reid came out recently, former Senate majority on the Democrats, and he said this point. He said you can’t allow him to go into elections saying, “Well, I didn’t do anything wrong. Democrats didn’t impeach me.” Right. It works both ways. Right. Not impeaching him has a price as well.Right. So do you imagine there’s ever gonna be a shift, or not? Do you think she’s not gonna shift?As of this moment, I don’t think she’s gonna shift. I hope to be proven wrong. As I say, predictions are hard in American politics. No one can predict anything because life is so crazy. Seventeen Republicans ran for President in 2016, and the guy from Home Alone 2 won. I stopped making predictions after that. Brexit, I’m British, I mean, come on. I didn’t see Brexit coming, so two for two, failed on both those predictions. Even in the Democratic race I have no ... I don’t know who’s gonna win. Such a long way away. We’re all making ... Biden’s leading the polls. Who do you like?I like two candidates. I like Elizabeth Warren, and I like Bernie Sanders. Smartypants. Yeah. I think they’re the people who get the challenges, they’re the people who get the fight that needs to be had with the Republicans. They’re the people who’re actually gonna try and transform ... It’s not enough just to beat Trump. You have to beat at least some of the underlying factors that produced Trump. Trump is not the cause. Trump is a symptom. Therefore, to avoid the next Trump, the next Democratic president has to be able to take the fight. There’s certain things I like about Bernie Sanders that Warren doesn’t have. There’s certain things I like about Elizabeth Warren that Bernie Sanders doesn’t have. I think that the procedural stuff is so important, we’ve just been talking about it, the idea that you gotta get rid of the Senate filibuster. You gotta abolish the Electoral College. American politics is broken. I say that as an immigrant to your great country. It’s batshit crazy the way you run things, the way that some of the stuff here ... Americans have no clue, that’s my favorite part. They’re completely in the dark that other people in the rest of the world don’t do things like this. No other Western country allows politicians to draw up the boundaries of their own seats. That doesn’t happen anywhere but the United States of America. That’s mad.When you’re going into this, talk about it globally, and then I wanna finish up talking about, what’s sort of tech’s responsibility in this. The rest of the world doesn’t look so perfect, either.No.You’ve got a mess in Britain, with it looks like Boris Johnson is about to become prime minister. Oh, God. I know, right?Our very own Trump. The British Trump.A little smarter.Little smarter. Low bar. Low bar. Yeah, low bar. But, also mad. Kind of mad. You’ve got stuff going on everywhere. And Islamophobic.Everywhere.Yes. It’s deeply depressing. And that requires a left that is up to the challenge of pushing back against the rise of a far right, against fascism. There’s a f word that we don’t use: fascism. These people are not Populists. It certainly annoys me. Bernie Sanders is a Populist. Victor Orban is a near fascist. It’s a problem for me. Yeah. Again, there’s no silver bullet. There’s no easy solution to this stuff. A lot of it dates back to the financial crisis. A lot of it dates back to the war on terror and 9/11. It requires people like Elizabeth Warren who are willing to take kind of a big-picture view of what’s going on. It requires people like Bernie Sanders, who’ve been consistently saying the same thing and were right about it, in terms of the oligarchy and rising inequality. And foreign policy, by the way. One thing that Bernie Sanders has that no one else in the field has is willing to really radically challenge some of the underlying premises about US foreign policy, regime change, this obsession with militarism, the Pentagon budget. That needs to change. And actually, a lot of Trump supporters even think that needs to change. What is the problem on the left, then? Criticize the left for me. Internally divided. Always.Intolerant?Intolerant of what?Well, that’s been one of the things. Just recently around lots of things.Intolerant in a self-critical way, yeah, we’re all intolerant. I’m intolerant. We’re all intolerant. In terms of the ... Is there a particular issue with the left being intolerant? No. We live in an age where the president of the United States says neo-Nazis are very fine people. The tolerance problem is on the right, and it’s all deflection to make it about campus free speech — absurd. The same people who obsess over campus free speech say not a word when Victor Orban is sitting in the Oval Office. Sorry, take your bad-faith bullshit somewhere else. Are there excesses on the left? Of course there are. They’re everywhere. There’s excesses everywhere. But that’s not the same thing. In fact, the opposite. The left now ... The interesting debate on the left, especially in relation to Bernie and Hillary Clinton legacy and Trump is what do you do about some of these issues about culture, race, “identity politics.” There’s a lot of people on the left who think identity politics is bad, who buy into this Trumpian narrative. I think that’s absurd. I think we have to have it. Sort of pedantry. What you call identity politics is people, marginalized communities...“This is what I am.”... who didn’t have a voice before, now have a voice, and you don’t like that voice. It’s uncomfortable. It doesn’t fit with your narrative. Even on the left. Where if you just wanna talk about ... Yeah, I think, too, that there’s been too much outsourcing. I think, too, the minimum wage needs to be raised. But that’s not enough to deal with Michigan, Pennsylvania. You also have to deal with the fact that a lot of racist people, misogynistic people voted for Trump. And it wasn’t about the economy. You have to address that point. You can’t just park it. And I get politicians can’t do that, they can’t insult voters, but some of us journalists and commentators ...Right, look what happened when Hillary Clinton ...Yeah, you could argue that her proportion of deplorables was on the low side. I would say, if we don’t do it as journalists, commentators, writers, academics, activists, intellectuals, who else is gonna do it? And that is a global, you should talk about global problems. It is a global problem. Modi. My parents are from India. Indian Muslims. This was explained to me. India. Narendra Modi is prime minister of India.He is.Just reelected for a second majority. India’s very hard to get a majority. We’re normally coalitions. Hugely popular figure, has his roots in a far right Hindu Nationalist organization called the RSS, which was modeled on the Nazis in the 1930s. He is the prime minister of India. He oversaw a massacre of Muslims in Gujarat. Reelected. And the economy did really badly, by the way. I would argue that, again, undermines the whole “this is all about the economy.” It’s not about the economy. It is about quote-unquote identity. Depends whose identity. It’s about majorities being unsettled by minorities having rights and voices. But he’s gonna have a harder time.He’s gonna have a harder ... But you know who’s gonna have a harder time? Muslims and Christians in India, because he’s basically ... It’s gonna be a window into what Trump would be like in a second term. Emboldened, unleashed, recognizing that now institutions can be even more irrelevant than they were before. Fake mandates, all of that stuff. Right. And you could also look at Netanyahu and Israel, and now he’s gotta now have another election. Because Israeli politics is the only place probably more batshit crazy than American politics. Yes, indeed. You’ve got the Netanyahu. You’ve got the Duterte. You got the Putin. You got the Orban. You got the Modi.I wanna finish up talking about if all of these people use social media really effectively ...Yes.Every one of them. Yes.In fact, someone was like, “The right’s against social media.” I’m like, “Why? It’s such a gift. Dictators love it.”It’s huge. It’s democracies that want to shut them down. Which is interesting, it’s Sri Lanka that turned it off, not India, not Duterte.Yes. Nobody loves social media like a dictator. That’s my feeling. Why not? It’s great. The great double-edged sword. Yeah, the Arab Spring is a classic example for me, always. There, you had this built up on Twitter and Facebook and people sharing and organizing rallies in Egypt and Tunisia, and yet the same regimes using social media to allow fake media, to crack down, to identify dissidents ...To create fake ... yeah. To create fake news but also to arrest people and target people. We’re now seeing that the Saudis now buying this Israeli surveillance technology to go after people like the late Jamal Khashoggi. That’s a real problem, obviously. WhatsApp and the role that WhatsApp plays. Don’t even get me started on that. No, please, get me started. Please. WhatsApp, India, I don’t know how many people are aware of that. When you try and forward it ...Yes, I’ve written about it a lot. But go on. Just for me, a lot of people don’t really when I tell them this, that when you try and forward a message to more than five groups on WhatsApp, you no longer can.Yes, you can’t. They turned it off.One of the main reasons for that is what happened in India, where it’s been used for kind of incite mob violence by politicians and mobs, spreading “actual fake news.”Do you know when that happened? Because I complained a lot about that. They said, “Look! We did it! Aren’t we great?” I’m like, “No!” You had it before, that you fixed it, you don’t get a pat on the head for not fomenting violence. Yes.That’s not a good thing. No. What took you so frigging long, is my question.Demand and supply, and the supply is on the social media side, the demand is us. This great insatiable appetite for this shit. So what would ... How do you ...It’s depressing as a journalist.How much do you blame the tech companies for it and what should happen to them? Because right now, obviously this week, YouTube takes extremist content off, a lot of people are saying that’s free speech, but it isn’t because they’re not public squares. So, I blame them a lot. I don’t blame them exclusively. I blame them a lot. When I look at ... I’m no expert on this stuff but when I look at, for example, YouTube. Until a couple years ago, no, there wasn’t really a big flat earth movement. And yet one study found, interviewed 30 people who believe in a flat earth. And they said, why do you believe in a flat earth? Twenty-nine of them said we saw it in a YouTube video. The 30th said my kid saw it in a YouTube video. And where do they get that? Because we know about the YouTube algorithms. You know better than me about sending you to the next place. I’m a Muslim. We talk about radicalization of Muslims. Where are these white nationalists getting radicalized? Absolutely. Some of the videos are crazy. Each video takes you to the next place. I think that’s the huge problem that YouTube has not really owned up to, either. I was on a platform with a guy from Google a couple of months ago. They’re kind of in denial still about how much still needs to be done. I don’t think they’re in denial anymore. More publicly. And maybe privately. And Facebook, we had the recent episode with Nancy Pelosi where the ridiculous executive came on CNN and tried to pretend that it’s nothing to do with us because we’re not content creators. Yeah, that was not a good thing for Monika Bickert.And the joke is, if that video had been a Mark Zuckerberg, we could all make a snarky comment about how long it would’ve stayed up. I think we know from all the leaks and the journalism from people like yourself that internally, they’ve known about this for a long time, about the addictive qualities, about the radicalization properties, about turning people down weird rabbit holes. They haven’t done anything about it. Until they’re caught.And why do you think that is? Do you think it will permanently affect ...For profit-making.You think it’s just profit. Because they’re profit-making monopolistic companies.See, I don’t think they don’t care. They don’t think about it. I don’t think they don’t ... Not even care, they don’t think about it. Never occurs to them. So when Zuckerberg originally after the election pooh-poohed the whole “we had nothing to do with it,” Russia, and later on came out and said we did, okay fine, I was wrong, what happened in the interim there, just pressure?I think he didn’t ... I don’t wanna say didn’t know, it’s different than didn’t know. It’s not that you ... Doesn’t even register on his radar. It didn’t register, It’s like it ... There wasn’t a problem with it. Unknown unknowns and coverups.Someone said, yeah, exactly. It’s like, “Oh, he didn’t know.” I’m like, “No.” Because if you didn’t know, but you knew it was bad, when you finally do know, that’s different than, “Oh, is that a problem?” That’s where you are with a lot of them. “Is that actually a problem?” Actually it is, to gay-bash people.And then the PR people kick in. Yes, it actually is a problem. Like this thing that’s going on with YouTube right now.One thing I would say on the tech front that I feel very strongly about based on our conversation over the last 45 minutes, this idea of working the refs, right? Before it was the New York Times, it was CNN. Now it is social media companies and they’re completely out of their depth when it comes to politics, when it comes to dealing with the alt right, when it comes to dealing with the Republican Party. You see that, the way that they’ve now pressured Facebook, that you have this “anti-conservative bias.” Your news people have anti-conservative bias. Zuckerberg calls in a bunch of conservative news people to have a chat. I don’t see him doing that with the left, sorry. It’s overcompensation. Jack Dorsey, classic example of that. Some of the stuff not to do: going out on Twitter and apologizing to Candace Owens because one of his, what is it, Twitter Moments team called her far right or right wing or whatever it is. Too polite for my view. Absurd, when you have liberals and leftists and people of color being doxxed and harassed, hate mail, death threats, and I don’t see Jack Dorsey going on and apologizing to them publicly. And again, why did you go on Sean Hannity? Because it’s overcompensation, overcorrection. We’re liberal West Coast tech people. We must be biased without really ... Therefore, we must — and the conservatives play them. Play them for the unfortunately naïve fools they are. Right. Last question. I thought you’d be perfect for this question. I’m thinking of doing a column on this. What would happen if Trump was thrown off Twitter, or Twitter didn’t exist?That’s such a good question. Isn’t it? Would it be a good column? Twitter was like, don’t write that column. No no, yes, yes, yes.I’d be able to take ... I’d be able to do my shave, shower, shit routine in peace in the morning and not log on to @realDonaldTrump, which is what I do every morning like every other journalist in America. Yeah, I’m torn, actually, because on the one hand, I see people saying, well, this is a violation, when he threatens war and violence.Yeah yeah, they’re not taking him off.Yeah, they’re not. He’s violating their standards. He’s a special case. They’re not taking him off. They’re not taking him off, but should he be taken? But what if they did? Just one morning, Jack Dorsey shaves his beard and eats a waffle.Yeah, and says, “Screw the conservatives.”“Wait a second, I haven’t been eating!”Yeah, screw the conservatives. We need to get rid of Trump. I don’t care what the conservative battle should be. By the way, there’s also a genocide in Myanmar. I would say that Trump would lose his mind. Conservatives would lose their minds, and Twitter would probably reverse it.Where could they say it?Conservatives would still be ... People would still be on Twitter, what if you banned them all? What they’re all gone? Some of them. They’re all gone. Kellyanne. There’s a purge.She doesn’t have the same impact.Hannity.Doesn’t have the same impact.He’s got 4 million or 8 million something followers. Still not the same impact. No, no. But they’d make a noise.Yeah, but would it be a loud noise?As we’ve seen, but Kara, as we’ve seen ...Or would it be like a Horton Hears a Who noise?But Kara, as we’ve seen, relatively speaking, the conservatives don’t need to have that much impact to get the bang for their buck. To get the return. It’s just interesting. And I think that just on the series of “should he be kicked off,” I’m always torn, because on the one hand, he’s polluting it, he’s violating it, he’s using it to hate. What he did to Ilhan Omar. He could literally get Ilhan Omar killed, when he shared that video in that way, that horrible video. So in those moments, I’m like, this is outrageous. On the other hand, wouldn’t I rather be hearing him say this shit on Twitter and actually get an insight into it? Haven’t you heard enough?I’ve heard enough, but at least I’ve got the evidence now for those people who might still be in denial about how completely off his rocker he is, about how racist he is, about how much he wants to be a fascist. Twitter is a great kind of repository. By the way, what will you do with the ... Would we lose the Trump archive? Can’t lose the Trump archive. There’s always a tweet. There’s been an art installation about it. There’s always a tweet. There’s an art installation showing them. You ever seen it?It’s history. No, I haven’t seen it. It is. It’s a fascinating history. Do you imagine any other future president being able to do this? I think the only other fantastic tweeter is — well, besides George Conway — is ...Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?Cortez. But she’s different.I know. She can’t run for president for two more elections, sadly.I said she speaks it natively.She’s brilliant. When she did ...She’s a native speaker. He’s a broadcaster. He’s a blunderbuss.When she took out Lindsey Graham was astonishing. She actually makes me feel good about being on Twitter.Is it going to be good for politics going forward?I hope it is, as a tool of social activism. That, for me, is the No. 1 reason it could, as someone on the left.What about political influence?In terms of affecting political change and political influence, I hope that’s how it can be used. That’s how it would be in an ideal world. I do think that, in terms of the future question about presidents, the only thing that keeps me hopeful is that Trump is so unique that there is no person, not just good at it, but he’s so bad at things as well. He’s so bad at being a fascist that he can’t actually bring in fascism. Incompetence is what has saved us so far from full-blown fascism, and I wonder what would happen if you got a fascist who was not nuts, who didn’t say shit about the porn stars he had slept with and paid them off, who didn’t go mad about mad stuff on Twitter, who didn’t go to the D-Day Normandy signing and sign his name at the top of the paper.A little less, a little more...Someone who still has the same agenda but does it with a smile and with less overt racism. I think we’d be in serious trouble, because we’ve seen this appetite for it.It’s interesting. I had a discussion with one of the big companies and one of the founders of one of the big companies, and I said something they didn’t like. I said, “I’m worried about someone crazy running your company. That’s what I’m worried about. Someone who’s really, truly evil.” I said, “With all the information you have and all the control you have, that’s what I’m worried about.” “Well, that’s never going to happen.” I’m like ...Have you seen who’s in charge of the NSA, the CIA, the Secret Service, the DIA?I was like, “Literally, it can. It can happen. That’s not true.”What we haven’t acknowledged globally, collectively as a society, is that he’s now changed the rules for everything.Absolutely.We’re just talking about presidents, but you have CEOs, you have media organizations, you have academics ... across the board, it’s now, “but what about the president of the United States?”Except others do suffer when they do things on it. Only one person doesn’t suffer. It’s a really interesting thing. When others do tweets, or the guy that hit the guy at the basketball game, he suffered.Like Ted Cruz. If he was president today, he might have the same Islamophobic, misogynistic, etc. agenda. He wouldn’t be able to get away with saying the kind of crazy stuff that Trump says.It’s interesting. I was just saying, the guy who hit the guy on the basketball court. That guy got in trouble because that clip went over and over.Which keeps me hopeful that some of this will end with Trump. A lot of it won’t. There’s a whole generation of young people, young kids, who’s seeing this in high school. You’ve seen the racist attacks, you’ve seen the level of bullying is going up. There’s a whole group of kids being brought up thinking, “This is fine.”There’s also a whole group of kids that are not like that.Exactly.My kids aren’t like that. It’s interesting.My kids aren’t like that, but who’s going to win?Yeah, we’ll see. Anyway, this has been a lot of fun.We’re going to win, Kara.We’re not winning. I’m just going to leave. That’s what’s going to happen. Anyway, we’re just going to be really irritating and be old people on it going, “Ah.” You know what I mean? That kind of stuff.Like the president.Or, I’m just going to disappear. That’s my plan.No. Don’t disappear.I’m going to become a hermit. I don’t know if you know that’s my plan in the end. Anyway, I appreciate ...As long as you have Twitter, you won’t be able to be a hermit.You’re never going to see me again. Anyway, thank you.Thank you.Recode and Vox have joined forces to uncover and explain how our digital world is changing — and changing us.

Israelis are celebrating the US Embassy move. Palestinians are dying.,2018-05-14,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:The harsh reality of Trump’s embassy move — and how it relates to the deadliest day in Israel-Palestine since 2014.The mood in Jerusalem was festive. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were in town to attend the new US Embassy opening, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. President Donald Trump gave a televised speech from Washington, insisting that America’s “greatest hope” for Israel is “for peace.”Just 60 miles away, in the starkest contrast imaginable, Israeli soldiers were firing on Palestinian protesters at the Gaza border to protest the embassy move, demonstrations that were part of a protest wave ongoing since March. Most of the protesters were unarmed, though some threw rocks and Molotov cocktails; the Israeli military reported at least one attempt to detonate a bomb at the border during a demonstration.Before and during the embassy opening ceremony, 40,000 Palestinians marched toward a border fence defended by Israeli soldiers. The Israelis responded with live ammunition, killing more than 50 Palestinians and injuring another 2,400 (per the Gaza Health Ministry). No Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded.The contrast between these two events is profoundly jarring. While American and Israeli luminaries attended a high-level diplomatic event, in which Israel’s prime minister declared that  “this is a great day,” people were literally dying just dozens of miles away. AFP journalist Patrick Galey has, on his Twitter feed, been juxtaposing two photos taken around the same time: one from the embassy opening, the other from the Gaza protests. The contrast lays bare both the harsh reality of what’s happening and the utter irresponsibility of Trump’s decision to move the embassy in the first place:This violence was eminently predictable. Though Israel’s government is based in Jerusalem, and Congress had passed a law in 1995 requiring the US to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city, US presidents had repeatedly issued a waiver blocking the move from taking place. The logic was very clear: Jerusalem is one of the major flashpoints in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming the city as rightfully theirs.Moving the US Embassy would be a sign that the United States was recognizing the city as Israeli without also recognizing the Palestinian claims to it, a move that would anger Palestinians and jeopardize America’s broker status in peace talks. Experts on the conflict warned that moving the embassy would be like lighting the fuse on a powder keg; the Israeli-Palestinian situation is perpetually on the brink of violence, and doing something like this risked kicking off another round of conflict.Trump ignored this advice, officially announcing the plan to move the embassy in December. Initially, the response to the announcement from Palestinians and the broader Arab world was relatively muted, suggesting that fears of renewed conflict may have been overblown. But today’s events — the deadliest day in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since the 2014 Gaza war — proves that they weren’t entirely off base. Trump didn’t create a tense situation on the Gaza border; there had been months of conflict between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters, stoked by Hamas (the radical Islamist group that controls Gaza). But doing something so obviously inflammatory, with little obvious strategic upside to the United States, was irresponsible and dangerous. The question now is whether today’s carnage will be the exception — or whether we’re seeing the start of a new round of violence that could easily spin out of control.To learn more about the situation in Gaza, listen to the May 15 episode of Today Explained.

"Israeli settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, briefly explained",2023-12-02,Vox,['Avishay Artsy'],"Filed under:With the world focused on Gaza, Israeli settlers and soldiers are increasing attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank.The world’s eyes have been on Gaza since Hamas’s brutal attack on Israeli citizens on October 7 and Israel’s retaliatory invasion that has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians. But another front in this long-running conflict is the West Bank, a kidney-bean shaped piece of land on the west bank of the Jordan River and to the east of Israel that is home to nearly 3 million Palestinians and would make up the heart of any future Palestinian state. Alongside those Palestinian cities and villages, however, are Jewish settlements.Since the Six-Day War of June 1967, the state of Israel has planned and funded Jewish outposts throughout the West Bank; other settlers have moved in without the state’s explicit backing. The settlers believe they have a right to be there, even though most of the international community views the settlements as illegal.These populations are largely separated by Israel’s complex security infrastructure, including military checkpoints, armed patrols, a separation barrier, and color-coded identification cards and license plates. This system dictates all aspects of daily life for West Bank residents.Some settlers have for years harassed and attacked the Palestinians living there, often with impunity and occasionally with the support of Israeli soldiers. In the weeks since October 7, however, the rate of violence has significantly increased. It is already the deadliest year since the Second Intifada, and is getting bad enough for the eyes of the world to occasionally leave Gaza and look to the West Bank.“I continue to be alarmed about extremist settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank,” President Joe Biden said in late October, comparing the attacks to “pouring gasoline on fire.”Meanwhile, popular support for Hamas has surged among Palestinians in the West Bank as faith in the Palestinian Authority plummets.This escalation of settler violence could, as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp explains, “lead to a deeper entrenchment of Israel’s occupation and, quite possibly, a violent Palestinian response that brings outright war to the West Bank.” That would in turn “weaken the already-slim prospects of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the foreseeable future,” he writes.The writer Nathan Thrall is well acquainted with the dual lives of Palestinian and Israeli residents of the West Bank. Thrall spent a decade at the International Crisis Group covering Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. In his new book A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy, he tells the story of a Palestinian father from the West Bank searching for his son who’s gone missing after a school bus accident.Thrall spoke with Today, Explained host Noel King about the history of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and why Israel faces strong criticism for its support of settlers, not just from Palestinians but also from some Israelis and the international community. Read on for an excerpt of the conversation that aired on November 20, edited and condensed for length and clarity, and listen to the full conversation wherever you find podcasts.Help situate us: What does the West Bank look like? And who lives there?The West Bank is quite hilly. It has a mountain ridge running through the middle of it, north to south. And it is covered with Israeli settlements. These settlements in the popular imagination are a set of caravans haphazardly erected on a hilltop. [Some newer outposts, particularly illegal ones, do consist largely of portable buildings.] But in fact, [many] are towns and cities that look identical to the communities of similar size within Israel proper. And they are connected seamlessly to Israel proper. The residents of these communities include Israel’s elite. They include Supreme Court justices. They include ministers in the Israeli government and many, many other government employees and leaders in industry. These people are able to live in these communities precisely because they have been segregated from the Palestinian population that surrounds them. They have been given roads that cut through these Palestinian communities without having exits or entrances for the Palestinian communities that these highways pass through. This whole architecture, this infrastructure, gives the Jewish residents of these settlements the illusion that they are living in a Jewish-only zone where they don’t really have to confront or think about the Palestinians who are just beside them, and they can go very easily to their workplaces in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem and believe that they are living in a suburb just like any other. How long have the Israeli settlements been in the West Bank?The settlement project began, really, as soon as Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Those settlements were created by the Israeli center left that had been in power since the establishment of the state in 1948 and remained in power until 1977. So for the first decade of the settlement project, it was driven by center-left governments. And it’s important to stress it was driven by the government. This is not a story of a bunch of radicals twisting the arm of the state against its will, which is how it’s often depicted. This is a state-driven project and it is in fact the greatest project, the largest and most expensive project, that the state of Israel has undertaken.As the settlers have moved in, how have they justified this?There are a number of different motivations for moving to the settlements. Broadly speaking, there are three groups of settlers.There are ideologically driven settlers who believe that the West Bank is the historic homeland of the Jewish people and that they have every right to build homes and establish Israeli sovereignty in these areas, no less so than Israel had a right to establish settlements in 78 percent of historic Palestine, the borders of Israel prior to 1967. And this is an argument that they make to their detractors in Israeli politics. The second type of settler is just an ordinary middle-class or upper middle-class person who is moving there because there are financial incentives to do so. You can have a nicer home, a larger home, a less expensive home. And because it has all been set up in a way that makes it painless to live there and gives you the sense that this is really no different than any other suburb, members of the middle class do move there. What happens over time is they often start to shift ideologically after moving there because every human being naturally wants to feel justified in what they’re doing. The third type are ultra-Orthodox Jews, and they historically had avoided living in settlements. But that changed. And they live in a few settlements, but they’re very large and dense. And those settlements are, for the most part, closer to the edge of the West Bank, closer to the boundary with pre-1967 Israel.How do Palestinian and Jewish residents of the West Bank interact with each other? Do they interact with each other, typically?The Palestinian and Jewish communities in the West Bank are entirely segregated and the settlements have gates at their entrances and security guards at those gates. Palestinians are not allowed to enter them unless they are coming as pre-approved workers, as cleaners or gardeners or construction workers. That’s the degree of segregation that exists in the West Bank. [Israel justifies these measures as necessary for the security of both Jewish and Palestinian populations, but human rights groups like B’Tselem say these tactics are entirely geared toward making Palestinians’ lives unbearable and forcibly driving them off their land.]So this is a highly unequal situation. If you are Palestinian in the West Bank, you are subject to restrictions. You are subject to inequities. But then on top of that, Nathan, we hear about settler violence. What does this refer to? What does that mean?So settler violence is a broad term that includes everything from settlers going and burning down olive trees of Palestinians who live nearby. It includes raids on Palestinian communities in the middle of the night. It includes activities that Israeli officials even have referred to as pogroms, such as the burning of all kinds of property in the town of Huwara earlier this year or in the town of Turmus Ayya last June.The Palestinians who are attacked are entirely defenseless in this situation. [Israel points to terror attacks by Hamas, including a November 30 shooting at a bus stop in west Jerusalem, as a reason to maintain security measures.] They know that if they lay a single finger on an armed settler who enters their home, they can be arrested and put in jail and locked up in what is known as administrative detention, which is detention without trial or charge. Israel can do that for six months to somebody, and then extend it indefinitely.And so when a Palestinian encounters a settler militia, they know that putting their finger on that settler is not putting their hand on an individual. It’s putting their hand on the entire state of Israel, this enormous machine that controls their every movement and that can arrest them and their family members at any moment.How is it that the settlers can commit such violence without legal repercussions? Where does the law fit in here? The law doesn’t fit in here because there is total impunity for the settlers. When there are cases filed against settlers for attacks on Palestinians, fewer than 10 percent result in an indictment and only 3 percent result in a conviction. That’s data from the last 18 years. And now after October 7, when most of the regular army is off in Gaza or on the border with Lebanon, you have those same settlers who were attacking the Palestinian communities several months ago, now in uniform [called up from the reserves], with full authority to do those same attacks as the army.We know that there will be an end in Gaza. We don’t know what it is. And it sounds as though the Netanyahu government and the international community are actively debating, discussing, what the end in Gaza will look like. But in the West Bank, it seems as though there is no end in mind. How do you envision this playing out? Where do you think this is all leading, Nathan?No matter how long this war in Gaza lasts, whether it’s weeks or months or years, at the end of it, we are going to be in the situation that we were in on October 6, which is 7 million Palestinians, 7 million Jews, all living under Israeli rule. And the vast majority of those Palestinians don’t have basic civil rights. That’s the situation that the international community and the United States will need to address if they want to see an end to this recurrent bloodshed.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Could Israel dump Netanyahu in the middle of a war?,2023-10-31,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Israelis aren’t rallying around their prime minister. They’re rallying against him.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in trouble. As in, facing a non-zero risk of losing his job trouble. And this political drama could have a profound effect on Israel’s approach to the conflict with Palestine.Netanyahu’s poll numbers since the October 7 Hamas massacre have been grim: One recent survey found that a staggering 80 percent of Israelis held him personally responsible for failing to prevent the Hamas attack; another found trust in the government at a 20-year low. To address his collapsing support, the prime minister held a press conference on Saturday — his first since the attack.It was, to put it mildly, an embarrassment. Appearing alongside Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and National Unity party leader Benny Gantz, the prime minister appeared out of sorts, stumbling over a prayer for the Israeli army. He faced so many hostile questions from reporters, and had so few good answers, that he left early — only answering seven of the 12 questions he was slated to take. Hours later, around 1 am Sunday Israel time, he sent out a tweet blaming Israel’s military and intelligence services for the failure to stop Hamas’s incursion — while pointedly refusing to take responsibility himself. The public backlash was so severe that Netanyahu deleted the post and apologized for sending it, the first time he had apologized for anything since the war began. (He still has not accepted any responsibility for the government’s failure.)While many Israelis almost immediately blamed Netanyahu for the attack, they could spare little energy for internal political conflict amid the horror. But the weekend’s debacle has brought the question of Netanyahu’s fitness for office during wartime to the center of Israeli political debate. In a Sunday interview, retired Israeli Gen. Noam Tibon — who, as a 62-year-old private citizen, took up arms on October 7 to defend Nahal Oz against Hamas — said Netanyahu needed to “resign now” for the good of the war effort. “The people need to feel security — they need to be sure that we are going to be victorious. I don’t think he can lead us to victory,” he told Israel’s Channel 12.Tibon is not alone. By Monday morning, the anti-Netanyahu voices had grown to include some in his own Likud party suggesting (anonymously) that his time might be up.“There is a growing number of prominent personalities, many from the security & intelligence communities, calling Netanyahu not only unfit and unworthy, but mentally incompetent,” Daniel Seidemann, a leading Jerusalem-based analyst of the Israel-Palestine conflict, wrote on Twitter (the platform also known as X). At a Monday news conference, Netanyahu was even asked if he would resign.There is a general sense among Israeli analysts that Netanyahu is nearing the end of his political rope. Israeli voters do not forgive and forget security failures — and this is the greatest in the country’s history, with significant evidence of his own personal responsibility. Though Netanyahu has weathered a lot, including an ongoing criminal trial, his political fall now feels like more of a “when” than an “if.”But even if this analysis is correct, that “when” might not be anytime soon. The next Israeli election isn’t scheduled for another three years, and there’s but the faintest of chances he resigns of his own free will before then.The only plausible way to see a change in government in the coming months would be if at least five members of his pre-war governing coalition vote against him in the Knesset (Israel’s Parliament). Whether this could happen is anyone’s guess; it depends on the decisions of a few legislators who won’t talk publicly before they act.The stakes are very high. If Netanyahu is toppled sooner rather than later, the nature of Israel’s policy toward the Palestinians could change significantly at a crucial time. Benjamin Netanyahu has been in power for a very long time. He was prime minister between 1996 and 1999, and then again led Israel for every year (save one) since 2009. All told, he’s the longest-serving leader in the country’s history.Prior to the outbreak of the current war, it looked like his biggest legacy was picking a fight over the foundations of Israeli democracy. As part of a bid to protect himself from the very real specter of jail time stemming from corruption charges, Netanyahu formed an alliance with ultra-Orthodox and far-right parties premised on placing the judiciary under their political control. The first legislative piece of this judicial overhaul passed over the summer; Netanyahu’s government was busy trying to ram through a second piece when Hamas struck.The judicial overhaul was astonishingly unpopular, spawning the largest protest movement in Israeli history. It meant that many Israelis were deeply hostile to his government prior to the attack — and had zero inclination to give him the benefit of the doubt after it happened. Netanyahu said on Saturday that the overhaul was dead, at least for as long as the war is ongoing, but the resentment it spawned remains.To make matters worse for Netanyahu, there are specific good reasons to hold him responsible for the Hamas attack.During this long tenure, his approach to Hamas’ regime in Gaza has been largely leaving it alone — even at times propping it up as a counterweight to the Palestinian Authority that rules the West Bank, through measures like facilitating cash transfers from Qatar to the Islamist group. The basic idea, he reportedly said at a 2019 meeting of his Likud party, was that the existence of Hamas foreclosed a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict.“Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,” he said in comments first reported by Haaretz. “This is part of our strategy — to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.”Obviously, this looks terrible in hindsight.To make matters worse, Netanyahu had been repeatedly warned by members of Israel’s security establishment that the judicial overhaul push had been making Israel vulnerable — that, by dividing the society against itself, he created an impression that it might not be able to respond to an external attack. He ignored these warnings, focusing his security attention in recent months on a mostly self-created crisis in the West Bank — which seemingly took military resources away from monitoring Hamas in Gaza.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]It’s easy to see, given this context, why Netanyahu and his Likud party is plummeting in the polls. One post-attack poll found that, were elections held tomorrow, Likud would go from its current 32 seats in the Knesset to just 19 — a roughly 40 percent drop.“There’s probably something about this polarized context, and the fact that the attack is considered (rightly so, in my view) a failure specifically of Netanyahu, that prevented a rally-round-the-flag,” says Noam Gidron, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Gidron also points to Netanyahu’s post-attack conduct as a significant drag on his popularity. He doesn’t just mean the prime minister’s boorish refusal to shoulder any blame for intelligence and security failures, but also the government’s poor performance after the war began.Netanyahu has failed, for example, to provide adequate support for the tens of thousands of Israelis displaced in the wake of Hamas’ assault. Private organizations, including an anti-judicial overhaul protest group, are left to fill the gap. Netanyahu appointed a political crony to head hostage rescue efforts, which has predictably led to significant (and embarrassing) clashes with the families of Israelis held captive by Hamas — many of whom feel like the government is not making the rescue of their loved ones a priority.Whether any of this could lead to Netanyahu losing his job ahead of schedule is very hard to say. He categorically rejected the idea of resigning when asked at that Monday press conference, saying “The only thing that I’m going to have resigned is Hamas.”Assuming he sticks with this pledge, he would have to be forced out by his own political allies. His pre-war governing coalition consisted of his right-wing Likud party, the extreme-right Religious Zionism slate, and two ultra-Orthodox parties (Shas and United Torah Judaism). Together, these parties control 64 out of the Knesset’s 120 seats — which means his rivals would need to recruit at least five members from their ranks to win a no-confidence vote and trigger new elections.Under normal circumstances, that would be hard to imagine. But there are rumblings, especially in the wake of Sunday night’s Twitter debacle, that a push for defections might be gathering steam. Ultra-Orthodox parties, whose flexible policy positions on many non-religious issues enable them to join more centrist governments, are seen by some as the most likely coalition factions to support a push to hold a no-confidence vote.“There are ministers and [lawmakers] from the [Likud] party who would join such an initiative. But the key to its success lies with the ultra-Orthodox,” an anonymous Likud minister told the Haaretz newspaper. “Likud members won’t join with just the left to topple Netanyahu; they need some other party from the governing coalition to join them.”Whether or not this will actually happen remains to be seen. Netanyahu is a brilliant politician, and has outlasted many threats to his political survival in the past. But this time could be different.“Depending on how the fighting goes, some in the coalition may decide to turn openly on Netanyahu,” says Natan Sachs, the director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. “I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s not impossible.”Netanyahu is, it’s fair to say, a towering figure in Israeli politics. Were he to fall, the consequences would be significant — an opening of Israeli political horizons that could very well change the course of the country’s history.It’s hard to say exactly what the consequences would be for the immediate war effort. There’s simply too much uncertainty about if, let alone when, he might go down, to be able to make any predictions with specific confidence.But one thing is for sure: Netanyahu’s fall would remove a significant barrier to a political resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The prime minister isn’t the only barrier — in fact, not even the biggest one —  but he is certainly a big one. Netanyahu’s contributions to foreclosing a negotiated settlement are almost too numerous to count. He has presided over significant settlement expansion, moves to annex the West Bank, attempts to divide and conquer Palestinians by splitting the West Bank and Gaza politically, a far-right drift inside the Likud party, and the entrance of outright Jewish supremacists into Israel’s government. Were Netanyahu to be ousted, the general sense is that one of Israel’s several centrist parties would rise to power.“There won’t be a turn to the left. But there could be, for lack of a better term, a turn to the radical center,” Sachs says.Right now, polls suggest that Gantz, leader of the centrist-to-center-right National Unity party, would be the primary beneficiary. But Gantz is serving in Netanyahu’s war cabinet on an emergency basis; his popularity may fluctuate alongside Israel’s war functions. That could leave room for others, like the centrist-to-center-left Yair Lapid and his Yesh Atid party, to emerge as the leading alternative over time. Gantz, Lapid, or any other character in the broader center would certainly be less hostile to Palestinian national aspirations than Netanyahu. They wouldn’t, for example, form a post-Netanyahu government with the far-right Religious Zionist party that’s currently pushing Netanyahu’s approach to the Palestinians in an extreme direction. In fact, they’d almost certainly need some votes from the left in order to form a stable government.It’s difficult to speculate on what this might mean in nitty-gritty policy terms. But we know that, in broad strokes, the nature of the government could affect how Israel chooses to prosecute the war; whether it decides, for example, to reoccupy Gaza and reestablish settlements there. We also know that, in the longer run, a more centrist Israeli government would be less likely to take actions that moved the conflict away from a negotiated settlement — and might even take steps to make one more likely.Maybe the best way to think about it is like this: Right now, Netanyahu is a major barrier standing in the way of Israel changing its policy toward the Palestinians — a policy that brought us to the current disaster. Were he to leave, that barrier would be removed. While it might not automatically make life better for Israelis and Palestinians, it would certainly create conditions under which more positive developments become more likely.It’s one scant ray of hope amid the nightmare in which the two peoples are currently trapped.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Yes, the Ohio train wreck is an environmental disaster. No, it’s not Chernobyl.",2023-02-18,Vox,['Benji Jones'],"Filed under:How bad is the East Palestine derailment, really?  The images from East Palestine, Ohio, earlier this month are frightening. They show a giant tower of thick, black smoke rising from a train wreck and expanding into the horizon, as if a bomb went off. The description of what happened isn’t much less worrying: A large train derailed that was carrying hazardous chemicals, and some of them leaked into the air, water, and soil. To avert an explosion, authorities purposefully detonated a chemical called vinyl chloride, which caused the dark plume. It looks bad. It sounds bad. So, how bad is it really?The East Palestine incident is not an environmental disaster on the scale of Chernobyl, the BP oil spill, or the lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan — events that had very clear and devastating impacts on human health and wildlife. Some initial testing from the Environmental Protection Agency in East Palestine suggests that the air is safe to breathe and the municipal water is safe to drink. There doesn’t seem to be much immediate danger.What is concerning is that the specific risks of the spill are unknown, including the long-term threat. That’s partly because these chemicals are unusual; scientists don’t fully understand what level of exposure to vinyl chloride and other compounds spewed from the train is safe, or how they interact with each other. Plus, many of the sensors used to measure concentrations of them are not very sensitive, and even small quantities could harm people, experts say. So where does that leave residents of East Palestine?The disaster in East Palestine, a town of roughly 4,700, was caused by a train wreck two weeks ago. While traveling east in Ohio not far from Pittsburgh, 38 cars in a freight train operated by Norfolk Southern derailed. Eleven of them contained hazardous chemicals, some of which spilled onto the ground and into waterways or were burned off by authorities.  These aren’t natural substances like what you’d find at an oil spill but synthetic compounds made by the chemical industry, said Delphine Farmer, a chemist at Colorado State University. Five of the derailed cars, for example, carried vinyl chloride, a colorless gas that’s used to make PVC pipe. Another contained butyl acrylate, a clear liquid used to make glue, paint, and other products. Scientists know that these chemicals can harm humans and wildlife. Exposure to vinyl chloride can cause a range of symptoms including headaches and, with high exposure, a rare form of liver cancer. What’s more is that when the gas is burned — as it was, producing the dramatic plume from the images — vinyl chloride releases hydrogen chloride and phosgene, two other harmful chemicals, as well as a number of other toxic combustion compounds. Butyl acrylate, meanwhile, can cause a range of respiratory ailments. A number of residents reported headaches, respiratory problems, and dizziness in the days after the wreck, yet understanding the specific risks associated with this disaster is a challenge, Farmer said. For one, it’s not clear how much of the chemicals actually spilled into the environment. More importantly, these chemicals aren’t easy to measure. The air in East Palestine today won’t land you in the ER, Farmer said. Monitoring by health officials has not detected harmful levels of air pollutants from the wreck as of Friday, including vinyl chloride and hydrogen chloride. “The great thing about outdoor air is the atmosphere is very large,” Farmer said. “Dilution is your friend.”These chemicals also degrade in the environment, some in a matter of days, Farmer said. They’re not like “forever chemicals,” or PFAS, that can stick around for decades. “Over the next few days, the outdoor air should clear out and the indoor air should improve,” she said. That’s the good news. The challenge, however, is that many of the sensors used to measure air quality so far are not very sensitive, Farmer said. They’re good at identifying, say, a leak at a factory or the presence of chemical weapons, Farmer said, not at detecting trace amounts of airborne chemicals. This is a problem because even small amounts of some of these compounds could pose a threat to human health. More concerning still, she said, is that scientists don’t really know what level of exposure is safe over the long term. These are strange compounds that aren’t well tested, Farmer added. (The Environmental Protection Agency said it will release more, higher-quality data on air quality soon.)There’s better, more reliable information for water. Health authorities are far more equipped to sample harmful chemicals in wells and streams compared to air, Farmer said, and tests so far have come back clean. “The municipal water wells are safe to drink,” Anne Vogel, director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, said in a press conference Thursday. People in East Palestine who source water from private wells should still drink bottled water, according to health officials, until their wells have been tested.Separately, there’s also a plume of butyl acrylate that leaked from the train floating down the Ohio River, authorities say. Testing suggests it’s now diluted enough that it’s not hazardous to humans, according to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s office. It’s not clear what effect the chemical spill will have on wildlife, though shortly after the wreck wildlife officials reported the death of roughly 3,500 fish.Some experts are also concerned that authorities may not be testing for the full range of compounds that could harm humans. “It’s unclear what chemicals they’re testing for in comparison to what chemicals were generated and released,” said Andrew Whelton, an environmental engineer at Purdue University. It’s not just the chemicals that leaked from the train that are potentially hazardous, he said, but also compounds produced by combustion. “I am concerned,” he said. The long-term impacts of the spill will depend, in part, on how fast and thorough the clean-up is, Whelton has written. That’s what officials are doing now. Crews are digging out contaminated soils and damming fouled creeks, and removing pollutants from water. “If they don’t clean [the spill] up, it starts migrating,” Whelton said. But regardless of the clean-up effort, it’s hard to say what residents might experience in the years to come. The exact level of exposure is unclear, as are the impacts of individual chemicals on human health, Farmer said. Scientists also don’t know what happens when people are exposed to a combination of chemicals like vinyl chloride and butyl acrylate.“It’s really hard to know how those different chemicals interact and then how your body reacts,” Farmer said. “That’s why I think all the scientists are having a really hard time telling anybody what is going to happen long-term.” (To address health concerns, for at least the short term, the state is setting up a medical clinic in East Palestine.) But what is clear is that the train wreck is not catastrophic, Farmer said. “We’re dealing with a lot of questions and a lot of uncertainty,” she said. “I know that’s very uncomfortable for people, but they should not feel that they are in the next Chernobyl. They are not living in Flint, Michigan. It’s just not on that scale.” In other words, there’s no material or compound that’s causing severe health problems in a large group of people, or across a large region.

  Fortunately, there are also very practical things that residents can do to reduce their risk, Farmer said. Clean your house thoroughly, she said, especially if you’re in the evacuation zone. Wipe down your counters, floors, and walls. Wash every piece of fabric including your clothes and sheets. Many of these chemicals are water-soluble, so they’ll disappear in the laundry. If the outdoors doesn’t smell bad, open all of your windows and doors. “I would clean the hell out of my house,” Farmer said. “Cleaning is a bit of a pain, but it can actually work really well.”Umair Irfan contributed reporting.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The progressive foreign policy moment has arrived,2021-05-26,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:Progressives believe they helped push for a quick ceasefire in Israel-Gaza. Will they do more?As the Israel-Gaza war raged, President Joe Biden made clear to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that there was a problem.Full-throated support for Israel among Democrats was waning, namely because of progressives. Among the clearest signs were moves in the House and Senate to block a $735 million weapons sale to Israel, a deal that only weeks earlier Democratic congressional aides said they hadn’t considered controversial or even noteworthy. On May 19, about nine days into the conflict, Biden told Netanyahu that unless he wanted to risk losing bipartisan support for Israel in Congress, he “expected” the Israeli premier to wind down the fight. The next day, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire.Progressives in and out of government say their actions both pressured Biden and gave him a convincing talking point in conversations with Netanyahu. “Progressives deserve a little credit for the ceasefire,” said Ben Rhodes, a former top national security aide to President Barack Obama and an outspoken advocate for a more progressive foreign policy. “Biden was looking over his left shoulder and told Netanyahu, ‘You have to move on this.’” The true extent to which progressives directly played a role in ending this round of Israeli-Palestinian fighting is unclear. The administration insists no members of Congress changed Biden’s mind during the conflict, and the president openly stated last week that “my party still supports Israel.” But what is clear is that progressives no longer play a fringe role in the American national security discussion. They’re a real force, and their time is now.“Looking at where this debate was 10 or even five years ago and where it is now, I think we can’t help but be encouraged,” said Matt Duss, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s national security adviser and a leading figure of the progressive foreign policy movement.Progressives have made their voices heard on foreign policy throughout US history. From the Wilsonian era to the Vietnam and Iraq wars, they’ve long pressured American leaders to avoid conflicts abroad and focus on economic and social issues at home. The current progressive movement upholds those ideas and also places primacy on tackling climate change and promoting human rights while curbing support for authoritarian regimes.The problem is that it didn’t have much success swaying either the Obama or Trump administrations. Obama didn’t end the war in Afghanistan, for example, and supported Israel’s bombing campaign during the previous Israel-Hamas fight in 2014. “I think that undercut us with respect to human rights, and it didn’t help us make any progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue,” Rhodes told me.And though President Donald Trump shared some of the antiwar tendencies of progressives, namely not initiating long wars in the Middle East, he ignored all left-leaning advice while cozying up to dictators, minimizing human rights, calling climate change a “hoax,” and exacerbating racial tensions at home.But progressives did achieve one moral victory with Trump in office. After years of trying and failing, in 2019 Congress passed a resolution, spearheaded by progressives such as Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), to end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, though Trump vetoed it. Still, it proved progressives could have a serious impact on the broader national security debate.“The Yemen success was important and it gave momentum to the whole movement,” said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama White House official and now co-host with Rhodes of the left-leaning foreign policy podcast Pod Save the World.Biden’s rise, though, was a boon to the progressive foreign policy movement. Since the campaign, Biden’s team has remained closely connected to progressive climate, veteran, and other groups to hear their views on myriad national security issues. They’ve helped influence some of the president’s decisions, such as ending most offensive support for the Yemen war, withdrawing all US troops and contractors from Afghanistan by September 11, treating climate change as the top global threat, and waiving intellectual property protections for US-made Covid-19 vaccines.That’s not to say the president is pursuing a purely progressive foreign policy, or that progressives are entirely pleased with him. “The left thinks it’s getting a raw deal from Biden on foreign policy generally,” said Van Jackson, a former Obama-era Pentagon official now at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. That perception, he said, has to do with Biden tying domestic issues to competition with China and resisting making deep cuts to defense spending.Still, Jackson acknowledges, “there is a greater opportunity to influence policy from the left than any time since I’ve been alive.”But privately, progressives share their concern that their wins so far came in areas where Biden already agreed with them. On the campaign trail, Biden said he would end “forever wars” and focus his attention on motivating the world to confront climate change.The real test would be when progressives and Biden differed on a major issue. Then came the Israel-Gaza war.Following weeks of aggressive and at times violent Israeli actions toward Palestinians in Jerusalem, the militant group Hamas launched rockets at Israel on May 10. Israel responded with devastating airstrikes and artillery fire on the group’s positions in Gaza. The disparity between the two sides — Hamas has thousands of imprecise rockets while Israel has one of the world’s strongest militaries and most effective missile defense systems — meant it wasn’t a fair fight. Before a ceasefire ended the nearly two weeks of fighting, Israel had killed nearly 250 Palestinians, including 66 children, while Hamas had killed 12 Israelis, including two children.Biden, as he has throughout his career, backed Israel’s “right to defend itself” while initially saying very little about the plight of the Palestinians. Progressives countered the president, saying support for Israel could and should be coupled with defending Palestinian rights.Among the most vocal critics was Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress. On May 13, she gave an impassioned speech on the House floor about the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and why the US should reconsider its unconditional support of Israel.“When I see the images and videos of destruction and death in Palestine, all I hear are the children screaming from pure fear and terror,” she said, holding back tears. A statement from a Palestinian mother she read about putting her kids to bed during the bombings “broke me a little more because ... my country’s policies and funding will deny this mother’s right to see her own children live without fear and to grow old without painful trauma and violence.”Five days later, Tlaib confronted Biden on a Detroit tarmac during the president’s visit to a Ford electric vehicle center and spoke to him quietly for eight minutes. “Palestinian human rights are not a bargaining chip and must be protected, not negotiated,” a Tlaib aide said to NPR that day. “The US cannot continue to give the right-wing Netanyahu government billions each year to commit crimes against Palestinians. Atrocities like bombing schools cannot be tolerated, much less conducted with US-supplied weapons.”In a speech at the Ford center after their conversation, Biden addressed Tlaib directly, saying: “I admire your intellect, I admire your passion, and I admire your concern for so many other people.”“From my heart,” he continued, “I pray that your grandmom and family are well. I promise you, I’m going to do everything to see that they are, on the West Bank. You’re a fighter. And, God, thank you for being a fighter.”And Tlaib did keep fighting. In response to reports that the administration had approved the sale of $735 million in precision-guided weapons to Israel, Tlaib and two other progressives, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Mark Pocan (D-WI), put forward a resolution on May 19 to block the transaction. The next day, May 20, Sanders filed his own resolution with the same goal in mind. And by May 21 in Israel, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, with some crediting the congressional pressure for ending the fighting after just 11 days.US officials, including previous presidents from both parties, had sought to condition aid to Israel before. But to consider doing so while Israel engaged in a war with Gaza was different, and underscored the shift in Washington.“The politics of Israel have changed,” said Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), a progressive House Foreign Affairs Committee member. “People are standing up for what they believe, to be fair, but also to speak out against injustice, and I’ve seen many of my colleagues do it sincerely.”The question now is if the progressive momentum can be sustained. Progressives make three main arguments for their recent success and why they believe they’ll remain a force in years to come.The first is that Trump’s disregard for human rights and relationships with autocrats like Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and right-wing leaders like Netanyahu brought disparate progressive factions together. “The Trump years gave the progressive community time to formulate what their ideas really were,” said a senior House Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Progressives expect the misbehavior of foreign leaders to continue, providing endless fodder for their case. Netanyahu, for example, “is all about short-term, Pyrrhic victories and he’s fucking himself in the long run,” said Vietor, the progressive podcast host.The second is that the ubiquity of social media will continue to broadcast atrocities around the world. That will allow progressives to unite around whatever injustice goes viral online and then do something about it.“The burden of knowing, and being faced with reality, is acting on that reality you’re aware of. That wasn’t true for generations,” said Castro. “Now you’re faced with the facts and you have to govern accordingly.”And the third is that the progressive ranks in government keep swelling. “Progressives are saying things about foreign policy interests and values that a lot of Americans believe in and agree with, and have for a while,” said Duss, the Sanders adviser. “Thanks to years of hard organizing and policy work, there are more and more people in Washington who reflect those views.”New progressive voices keep arriving. In one 2020 election result that many saw as a sign of the times, Jamaal Bowman defeated pro-Israel House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel in New York. During the Israel-Gaza fight, now-Rep. Bowman put out a statement that was far more sympathetic to Palestinians than anything Engel likely would have offered. “It is imperative that the United States have an even handed approach and ensure our nation is not complicit in stoking the flames of conflict through continued settlement expansion and home demolitions that undermine the two-state solution, perpetuate endless occupation, and threaten the long-term security of both Israelis and Palestinians,” Bowman said on May 11.More support in the capital gives progressives like Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Tlaib even more political space to push their views and challenge Biden from the left. But experts wonder what will happen if the progressive foreign policy movement becomes too successful. One possibility is that receiving more attention and notoriety could force progressives to concretize and homogenize their views. “The risk of movements becoming more institutionalized is they lose their radical edge,” said Marie Berry, an associate professor at the University of Denver.And what if the movement becomes so successful that some of its proponents become the national security adviser, defense secretary, secretary of defense, or even president? That, ironically, could be a problem.“When you have to make hard choices about what you care about, things are going to get messy very fast,” said Josh Shifrinson, an associate professor at Boston University. And if a progressive finds themselves in the Oval Office, the problem will be that “you’re no longer the leader of the progressive movement, but the leader of US, which requires different choices, priorities, and thinking.”The progressive foreign policy movement will have to contend with those risks as it moves from the wings to center stage. But for now, their perceived successes during the Israel-Gaza crisis will likely keep them in the spotlight.“It will give us more confidence to conduct more foreign policy from the House and Senate,” said Khanna, one of the leading progressive lawmakers. “The voice of members of Congress can make a huge difference in standing up for human rights and for peace.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"When Trump tells you he’s an authoritarian, believe him",2023-11-14,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:He’s talking like a fascist. He’s planning fascist policies. He’s staffing up with fascists.Historically, the erosion of American democracy has happened subtly. In a country where democracy is basically a civic religion, politicians generally don’t announce their intention to attack it when running for office. The past decade of voter suppression laws, state-level rules explicitly designed to limit access to the ballot box, have been sold as tools for combating voter fraud. Many proponents of Jim Crow-era voting regulations — a nakedly racist attempt to ensure white political dominance — described them as a restoration of Southern democracy after the alleged Northern tyranny of Reconstruction. Donald Trump is currently testing the limits of that unwritten rule by all but openly campaigning on a platform of tearing democracy down.Perhaps the clearest sign came in a speech on Veterans Day where he vowed to “root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country that lie and steal and cheat on elections.” Calling one’s opponents subhuman and vowing aggressive action against them is a hallmark of classical fascist rhetoric, so much so that the Washington Post’s headline — on a news article, not an opinion piece — described it as “echoing dictators Hitler [and] Mussolini.” They’re not wrong: Anyone familiar with Nazi propaganda can tell you that it commonly dehumanized Jews by describing us as rats or diseases. Trump has used such language more than once: Just last month, he claimed immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country.”This incendiary language is backed by an incendiary policy agenda. Trump and his team have a series of proposals to crack down on dissent, including by remaking the Justice Department into a tool for jailing his enemies and sending troops to suppress protests. They aim to launch mass anti-immigrant raids and detain the people he rounds up in camps. They have extensive plans to replace as many as 50,000 career civil servants with ideologues and toadies, putting people ready and willing to undermine the rule of law in key positions to act on Trump’s dubious orders.Given Trump’s track record, we should take these threats seriously. Let’s not forget that many thought it was unthinkable that Trump would attempt a kind of coup after the 2020 election. We now know that’s exactly what happened, up to and including inciting an actual riot on January 6.There’s been a long-running debate among American political observers as to whether Trump can reasonably be described as a fascist. Between his increasingly fascist rhetoric and increasingly fascist second-term policy proposals, the debate should now be considered settled. A political leader who vows to destroy opponents he calls “vermin,” to weaponize the Justice Department against his critics, and to conduct political purges in the federal government is in fascist territory.Trump is talking like a fascist, planning fascist policies, and staffing up with fascists. While a second Trump term is vanishingly unlikely to produce an openly fascist state — that’s not really how authoritarian takeovers of democracy work today — it’s quite plausible that they could do extensive, even fatal, damage to the American system by pulling the right policy levers. This is what happened in Hungary, and what is currently happening in India, Israel, and democracies around the world. The fascist ideological positioning is a signal of intent: Trump is coming for American democracy. No one can say they weren’t warned.Whenever someone warns of Trump’s fascist tendencies, there are always two instinctive dismissive reactions you see from elements of the political commentariat: both from Trump apologists and from reasonable centrists who want to avoid what they see as left-wing alarmism.The first is to call it hyperbolic: Americans have long compared opposite-party presidents to fascists and been proven wrong each time. The second is to argue that the end of American democracy is unthinkable: The United States government has so many veto points that even a competent and determined authoritarian would find themselves hampered by Congress, federalism, and the courts.In light of Trump’s increasingly open authoritarianism, neither of these should provide much comfort.There is clearly a qualitative difference between Trump and previous presidents. As bad as (for example) George W. Bush’s record on civil liberties was, he didn’t refer to Democrats as “vermin” or vow to “root out” their presence in American life. He never even came close to firing tens of thousands of civil servants or remaking the Justice Department into a tool of personal revenge against political rivals. When he moved in that direction — firing nine US attorneys on seemingly political grounds — it produced a national outcry, a 22-month investigation, and the defenestration of top administration officials. Trump’s threats to do much worse, by contrast, seem to be fully supported by the institutional Republican Party. Warnings of looming authoritarianism under prior presidents, typically issued by fanatical partisans and figures on the political fringe, may have proved false. But we have ample evidence that these warnings about Trump’s authoritarianism, increasingly coming from credible sources in the political mainstream, are grounded in the reality of what his second term would look like.It’s also certainly true that Trump’s most dangerous moves would be contested at all levels of government; challenged by Democrats in Congress, hampered by court cases, and fought by Democratic-controlled state governments. But in the very best case, that means the gears of the federal government would grind to a halt during his presidency, as the entire system was consumed by the fight to defend itself from a hostile takeover. It’s hard to fully anticipate what the worst case looks like, but the breakdown of essential democratic functions — up to and including the basic fairness of the electoral system — is not off the table.The evidence we have from foreign countries suggests that, when an elected leader with authoritarian tendencies spends time out of power, they get much more aggressive in trying to seize power when they return to high office. This is the story of how democracy in Hungary collapsed, and how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought his country to the brink. And though the United States is very different from both Hungary and Israel, we also have a long history of anti-democratic politics — one that the Republican Party has, in word and in deed, grown increasingly comfortable aping in recent years.So while the extent to which Trump will succeed in making his vision a reality is certainly something that reasonable people can disagree about, the reality of that vision is not.This should be the starting point for any conversation about the 2024 presidential race. Anyone who cares about American democracy — regardless of whether you side more with Democrats or Republicans on more “normal” issues like taxes, pollution regulations, or Israel-Palestine — should understand that its health is on the ballot. There has simply been too much business as usual, in which America’s political class treats 2024 as if it’s just another hotly contested election in a long line of them. It isn’t, and the Trump campaign is making it clear that it isn’t on a regular basis. We in the press need to convey this to our readers as clearly as we can, a commitment which does not require abandoning the media’s core values of accuracy and fairness. On the contrary: It would be a betrayal of those values to shirk from reporting what the Trump people are telling us about themselves.When the Washington Post asked Trump’s campaign for comment on claims that his “vermin” language echoed fascist rhetoric, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung responded like this: “Those who try to make that ridiculous assertion are clearly snowflakes grasping for anything because they are suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome and their entire existence will be crushed when President Trump returns to the White House,” Cheung told the Post.In a way, the denial confirms the charge. There’s something funny about Cheung vowing to “crush” the “entire existence” of anyone who dares call his boss a fascist. But there’s also chilling reality. Trump’s spokesperson is either convinced he won’t pay a price for such authoritarian rhetoric, authoritarian enough that he’s unable to tell how thuggish he sounds, or convinced that this is the way Trump expects his underlings to talk.This is the operation that, at present, is beating President Joe Biden by about 1 percent in the RealClearPolitics poll average.

Why violence in Israel and Palestine has spiked in the last 48 hours,2023-01-27,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:A shooting in Jerusalem and a raid in Jenin, briefly explained.It’s been a violent two days in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. On Friday evening in East Jerusalem, a Palestinian gunman killed at least seven Israelis in the most lethal attack in the city since 2008. Israeli officials described the shooting outside a synagogue as an act of terrorism. Earlier Friday, three rockets were shot from Gaza and Israeli jets attacked an underground Hamas bomb-making facility, according to the Israeli military.A day prior, in the refugee camp of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, Israeli commandos raided an apartment building and the surrounding area, and killed nine Palestinians and wounded 20, in what a spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority called “a massacre.” Israel said the site of the raid housed a terrorist cell of the Islamic Jihad group.More than one Palestinian has been killed a day on average in the first month of 2023, on track to double the tragic rate of lethal violence in the occupied West Bank last year — which was already the highest on record since the United Nations began collecting this data, and double that of 2021.Little is known about the Friday shooter or his motives; he was killed by police after attacking the synagogue.The escalating cycle of violence comes as CIA director Bill Burns visits Israel and Palestine; Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives there on Monday. “We underscore the urgent need for all parties to de-escalate, prevent further loss of civilian life, and work together to improve the security situation in the West Bank,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement Thursday.But analysts described the increasingly deadly and volatile situation as a product of foreclosed hope and other structural factors, exacerbated by an extreme-right Israeli government taking power earlier this month. At the very least, things are unlikely to calm. The situation for Palestinians was already bad and continues to get worse, says Mairav Zonszein, an International Crisis Group analyst. “With a new far right government committed to continued dispossession of Palestinians and expansion of settlements, with the Palestinian body politic in shambles and no international stakeholder taking proactive steps, the crisis is likely to continue escalating,” she wrote in a message.It’s unusual, if not unprecedented, for a Palestinian attacker to respond so quickly to an Israeli raid like the one on Thursday in Jenin, an Israeli analyst speaking on condition of anonymity told me. Though it’s too soon to draw big conclusions about the particulars of each developing story, it is clear that the already dire situation could get very ugly.On Friday evening outside a synagogue in the Israeli settlement of Neve Yaakov in East Jerusalem, a Palestinian militant shot at least 10 people and then was killed by police. The situation is still unfolding, and no militant Palestinian groups immediately claimed credit, but police have identified the shooter as a 21-year-old resident of East Jerusalem. The attack occurred on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. No information about the victims was immediately shared.The Jerusalem police head pledged an “aggressive and significant” pursuit of anyone who abetted the attacker. “Israel will continue to act forcefully against the threat of terrorism. We will pursue and reach every terrorist who harms Israeli citizens,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. A day earlier, a deadly Israeli raid on a Palestinian home in the Jenin refugee camp killed nine, among them an elderly woman named Majida Obaid. “Most injuries that arrived at the hospital today were in the head and chest area,” read a Palestinian Ministry of Health statement Thursday on the raid, cited by the news site Mondoweiss. “This means that the shooting of live ammunition towards residents was with the intent to kill.” Israeli forces also obstructed the movement of ambulances with gunfire, the hospital’s head, Wissam Baker, told Al Jazeera.Armed Palestinian resistance groups have been expanding in the occupied territories, including in Jenin, partially in response to the fractured nature of Palestinian leadership, the lack of opportunities for Palestinians, and the long-stalled negotiations that could lead to an sovereign state of Palestine. Over the past year, Israeli forces have responded to these new groups, notably Lion’s Den, with intensive raids with high numbers of civilian deaths.The State Department’s top Middle East official, Barbara Leaf, told reporters Thursday that the lethal strike in Jenin had dismantled “a ticking time bomb of a threat — of a terrorist threat,” apparently amplifying comments from a senior Israeli military official.In response to the Israeli operation, Palestine Liberation Organization chair Mahmoud Abbas said he would cut off security coordination with the Israeli government. Some experts noted that’s often been a talking point for Abbas, but one he has not always followed through on.UN special rapporteur for human rights Francesca Albanese noted Israel’s obligation as an occupying power to safeguard Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and emphasized the “deeply alarming high rate of apparent extrajudicial killings of Palestinians of 2022 continues in this new year.”In November, Israelis elected the most extreme government in the country’s history. More than 80,000 protesters demonstrated against the government’s new members and their judicial moves that would weaken the authority of the country’s supreme court. Even Moshe Ya’alon, a former defense minister who had served as a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s center-right Likud party, has called the new Israeli government “a dictatorship of criminals.” But less attention inside Israel has been paid to the radical new governing coalition’s drastic implications for Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians living under occupation.“The death toll over both in the West Bank and now in Jerusalem is in fact the entirely predictable result of an extremist Israeli government that is propagating violence,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the advocacy and research organization Democracy for the Arab World Now.The Biden administration, for its part, has restrained its criticism of the government so far. Though the Biden administration still holds out the prospect of a two-state solution and an independent Palestinian state, those talks have been frozen since 2014, and more recently Israel has forged diplomatic relations with Arab states like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco, giving the government of Israel little incentive to advance any two-state outcome. It’s not entirely clear how Secretary of State Blinken will manage to deescalate tensions between Israelis and Palestinians during his upcoming trip. The priorities for the visit include “preserving the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the protection of human rights and democratic values,” all which appear at risk of devolving further.Tom Pickering, a career ambassador who previously served in Israel, is concerned that the rising violence could lead to a third Intifadah, or uprising, among Palestinians. “At the moment, the two-state outcome, as most people are fond of saying, is dead,” he told me. “But there is a no-state outcome that’s in the making” — that is, a status quo sought by the current Israeli government, in which a Palestinian state is no longer a viable possibility. But the tragic violence of the past two days shows that’s not much of a solution at all. The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What else should I read on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Here are some options.If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.If you want to learn more about the rising power of settlers and the settlement movement inside Israel, David Remnick wrote an excellent piece in the New Yorker.A solid introduction to the pro-Palestinian community, and particularly its internal divides, is Ben Smith’s profile of the fraught personal relationship between two leading advocates for Palestinian rights. Ali Abunimah, perhaps the most prominent advocate of both BDS and the one-state solution, and Hussein Ibish, a leading Arab supporter of the two-state solution, used to be close friends. Smith’s account of their bitter split says a lot about the various arguments on both sides of the internal pro-Palestinian divide — and how, in the case of Israel/Palestine, how the political always becomes personal.If you want to learn about the close and sometimes vexed relationship between American Jews and Israel, Peter Beinart’s ”The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment” is one of the most influential — and controversial — essays on the topic in recent memory. It doesn’t take too long to read; after you’re done, read Jason Zengerle’s breakdown of the heated, surprising debate Beinart inspired.If you’re interested in how demographics are forcing Israel to either leave the West Bank or abandon its dual Jewish/democratic identity, Israeli demographer Sergio DellaPergola, breaks the issue down clearly here.If you want to understand why the Israeli right is skeptical of peace with Palestinians, eminent Israeli historian Benny Morris’s piece on Palestinian ”rejectionism” is as clear an articulation as you could hope for.f you want to understand why Palestinians are skeptical of the two-state solution, read Columbia University historian Rashid Khalidi’s take on the current state of the conflict.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
How the US became Israel’s closest ally,2023-10-13,Vox,['Nicole Narea'],"Filed under:The US has stood with Israel throughout history. What does it mean for the Gaza war?Despite political differences that at times strained relations between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden, the outbreak of war in Gaza has reaffirmed that the US and Israel remain as tightly knit as ever.In recent days, US officials have reiterated their unwavering support for Israel — diplomatically, financially, and militarily. Biden, who has previously criticized Netanyahu’s right-wing government, was unequivocal in an address at the White House earlier this week: “We stand with Israel … And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack.”Appearing alongside Netanyahu on Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself, but as long as America exists, you will never ever have to. We will always be there by your side.” US officials have also urged Israel to take “every possible precaution” not to harm civilians as the country ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza in response to the Palestinian militant group Hamas’s deadliest attack in decades, in which more than 1,200 were reportedly killed. So far, Israel has seemingly ignored those urges: As of Friday afternoon, Israeli airstrikes had killed more than 1,700 in Gaza, and Israel is preparing for a ground invasion, giving civilians a 24-hour deadline to evacuate northern Gaza that the United Nations says will be impossible to meet. The US nevertheless has continued its unconditional aid to Israel, which has totaled $158 billion (not adjusted for inflation) since World War II — more than the US has given to any other nation. While US officials have said that they will not send troops to Israel, the US also remains deeply involved in supporting the Israeli military and security forces. In the wake of the recent attack by Hamas, it is sending guided-missile carriers and F-35 fighters among other equipment, and Congress is likely to authorize additional aid as well. The long history of US military aid to Israel has helped the nation develop its military prowess, and it continues to represent a significant share of Israel’s military budget. Over time, it has become less critical operationally as Israel has built up its own military production capacity, but the US has continued its aid as a demonstration of its resolute support for Israel, even in the face of global opposition to the country’s treatment of Palestinians.The US supported the creation of a Jewish state after World War II, but in the initial decades of its existence, the bond wasn’t particularly remarkable. President John F. Kennedy made it more a point of emphasis, calling it a “special relationship,” predicated on a shared commitment to Israel’s right to exist in peace, in 1962, and the relationship only really began to flourish following the 1967 War. That war saw Israel defeat a coalition of Arab states, suffering comparatively few casualties in the process with little help from outside forces, and occupy swaths of new territory, including Gaza and the West Bank. The US had been concerned about Soviet influence in the region and that the conflict could have expanded into a Cold War proxy battle if it had escalated further. But Israel put a quick end to it — and made itself an attractive ally at a moment when the US was preoccupied with the Vietnam War and did not have the bandwidth to get involved militarily in the Middle East. “What’s key about the ’67 War was Israel defeated the Arabs hands down in six days with absolutely no American military assistance,” said Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University. “What that said to the United States was, ‘These guys are good. We are in a mess in Vietnam. Let’s be connected to them.’ And things developed gradually over time.”At first, the US was mostly giving, but also selling weaponry to the Israelis, as well as allowing them to borrow from US banks at lower-than-market rates to support development efforts. In the 1980s and ’90s, the US and Israel began cooperating on research and development and production of weaponry. And in 1999, as former President Bill Clinton set out to foster lasting peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the US signed the first of three 10-year memorandums committing to provide billions in military aid annually. After the 9/11 terror attacks, that money helped spur advancements in Israel’s surveillance technology and signal intelligence, which by the 2000s, “were at least as good as and in some cases better than [that of] the United States,” Beinin said. In 2011, Israel implemented its Iron Dome — a short-range air missile defense system that uses radar technology to destroy rockets fired by Hamas and other militant groups. The system uses US-constructed parts, and is funded in part by the US. Currently, Israel receives $3.8 billion in military aid from the US annually under a memorandum signed in 2019. That accounted for about 16 percent of Israel’s total military budget in 2022 — a significant fraction, but not so large that Israel still depends on US aid in the way it once did. “This relationship has played a huge part in the advancement of sophistication of the Israeli armed forces,” said Michael Hanna, US director of the International Crisis Group, an organization focused on conflict prevention. “Israel’s relationship [to the US] is also unique in the region and that is demonstrated in the US commitment to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge, which is aimed to guarantee that Israel remains militarily superior to any other regional military.”Israel has also developed advanced manufacturing capabilities such that there are very few weapons or crafts that it could not produce on its own without US assistance, Beinin said. The exception might be F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, but even parts of those crafts are currently manufactured in Israel. That has made Israel the 10th largest military exporter in the world — and also made the US conversely reliant on Israel.  “The military-industrial surveillance complexes of both countries are very tightly intertwined,” Beinin said. “American capacities are now to some extent dependent on Israel.” The US has strong historical and economic ties to Israel. The US, which has supported the formation of a Jewish state since World War II, is Israel’s top trading partner, with annual bilateral trade of nearly $50 billion in goods and services. Beyond that, US officials have also long maintained that America’s relationship with Israel holds strategic value as a stabilizing force in the Middle East, keeping at bay unrest that would threaten access to the regional oil supply on which America remains dependent. Initially, Israel served as a countervailing force to Soviet influence, but this line of thinking persisted even after the Cold War. And it became even more pervasive after 9/11, when it was discovered that some of the perpetrators of the attack were citizens of Saudi Arabia, which the US counted as another key ally in the region. Doubting that it could continue to rely on the Saudis, the US leaned more heavily on Israel based on the perception that it had more shared values and interests. That includes a shared commitment to democracy, though Netanyahu’s undemocratic plan to overhaul the Israeli judiciary has recently put that in question.“It’s not only a long-standing moral commitment; it’s a strategic commitment,” then-Vice President Biden said in 2013. “An independent Israel, secure in its own borders, recognized by the world is in the practical strategic interest of the United States of America. I used to say … if there were no Israel, we’d have to invent one.”More recently, Israel has been a key pillar of the US’s stated goal to create an “integrated, prosperous, and secure Middle East” as it looks to turn its focus to other parts of the world, including Russia and China. The Trump administration facilitated agreements to normalize relations between Israel and several of its Muslim-majority neighbors, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco. There is speculation that Hamas’s attack was intended to upend talks brokered by the Biden administration to also normalize relations between Israel and its main regional rival Saudi Arabia so that they can form a united front against Iran, a common enemy that financially supports Hamas.“Israel is in the American camp, no ifs, ands, or buts. We don’t have to even worry about it. And that’s why Secretary Blinken is over there to show solidarity,” Beinin said.However, the Gaza war may threaten Israel’s position to act as a vehicle for US peacemaking in the region.Supporting Israel has also historically been incredibly politically popular in the US, bolstered by a well-funded pro-Israel lobby in Washington. However, that public support has markedly waned in recent years, particularly among Democrats, who marginally supported Palestinians over Israelis in a March 2023 Gallup poll for the first time. Some argue that the benefits of the US’s relationship with Israel do not justify their moral and literal price. As Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, noted in Foreign Policy, Israel did not support the US in two wars against Iraq and even required the US’s protection from Iraqi Scud attacks in the first Gulf War. Moreover, he wrote before the Gaza war, “decades of brutal Israeli control have demolished the moral case for unconditional US support.”But US policymakers seem to have accepted that it’s just the cost of maintaining the special relationship, which is not just military and political in nature, but also personal. “The United States would rather that that Israel didn’t massacre Palestinians. The United States would rather that Israel didn’t annex the West Bank, which it is in the process of doing,” Beinin said. “Sometimes, allies don’t do what you want.”US aid has helped build up Israeli weapons capacity, and human rights groups have documented incidents in which those weapons were used in the commission of war crimes and unlawful attacks in Gaza even before the war broke out. “We’ve called for all states to end all forms of complicity in those crimes, including suspending military assistance, so long as these crimes are being perpetrated,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch.In a 2021 outbreak of violence, for instance, Human Rights Watch documented three airstrikes in Gaza in which 62 Palestinian civilians were killed where there were “no evident military targets in the vicinity.” Under international law, only military objectives — not civilians or civilian “objects” — can be targeted. In two of those attacks, American munitions were used. “Although Israel now has its own arms and weapons industry, US military aid obviously still plays an important role, and we regularly see the US going even beyond its significant provision of military aid and upping the provision of services when there’s outbreaks of hostilities,” Shakir said.That’s happening again amid the Gaza war. It’s likely that the US Congress will authorize additional funding for Israel in the coming days and weeks, but before lawmakers can do so, they will have to choose a new House speaker. Biden has reportedly floated a proposal for $2 billion in supplemental aid that would go towards missile interceptors for the Iron Dome, artillery shells, and other munitions. However, the White House could try to tie that aid to other, less bipartisanly popular causes — including funding for Ukraine and Taiwan and border security — which could delay its passage in the Republican-led House.Israel may welcome that support as a “statement of diplomatic and political solidarity,” Beinin said, but “it won’t be critical in terms of what Israel is about to do now — unless they fire so many bullets that they run out of them.”The show of US support could deter potential actors in the region who could escalate the conflict, such as Iran and Hezbollah, the Islamist militant group based in Lebanon. But it could also stir anti-US sentiment in the Middle East as neighboring countries witness the death and destruction wreaked by Israeli forces in Gaza. “The tightness and breadth of this relationship … have made the US a target when faced with Israeli excesses,” Hanna said. “It is hard for the US to distance itself in any way from Israeli military operations.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The many, many times Israelis and Palestinians tried to make peace — and failed",2023-11-22,Vox,['Nicole Narea'],"Filed under:A timeline of the decades-long peace negotiations that came before the Israel-Hamas war.Even though Israel has approved a temporary ceasefire in its unprecedented assault on Gaza following Hamas’s October 7 attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that he still believes it is a “time for war,” not for peace.On Tuesday, he vowed that the war will continue “until Hamas is destroyed, all the hostages are released and there is nobody in Gaza who can threaten Israel.”But while US leaders have supported the Israeli war effort, they have also held out hope for an eventual two-state solution in which Israel and a sovereign Palestine exist side by side: “The only ultimate answer here is a two-state solution that’s real,” US President Joe Biden said recently. The two-state solution isn’t the only approach to solving the Israel-Palestine conflict. But it is the mainstream one; it’s been the international community’s approach for the last several decades. The idea is that US-brokered negotiations can lead to a peace treaty, or a “final status agreement,” which would establish a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank in exchange for a permanent end to hostilities. But in the three decades since this peace process really began — with the historic Oslo Accords in 1993 — the two-state solution has slipped further away. A lack of political will in Israel, Palestine, and the US, as well as disagreement over the precise contours of the deal, have rendered negotiations unsuccessful. Major sticking points include: what the borders of the two states should be (and where Jerusalem falls in that), whether Palestinian refugees who were forced out of what is now Israel will be able to once again live there (also known as the “right of return”), and how to establish security guarantees for both Israelis and Palestinians. Today, all of these issues remain major impediments to peace.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]Violence perpetrated by Palestinian militants such as Hamas — an organization many countries designate as a terrorist group — as well as by Israeli security forces, has eroded trust on both sides. So, too, has Israel’s expansion of illegal settlements in West Bank territory that the international community sought to set aside for Palestine. The more extreme elements of Israeli and Palestinian society, and their political leaders, have forestalled negotiations at critical moments.Israel and its allies have often laid the blame at the feet of Palestinians for rejecting what they saw as generous offers. “You are leading your people and the region to a catastrophe,” former US President Bill Clinton famously told the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat when he refused a peace deal proposed at Camp David in 2000. But Palestinians contend that those offers, no matter how generous by Israeli standards, never went far enough. Israel has always had the military and diplomatic edge in the conflict, with a powerful ally in the US. And Palestinians have been forced to progressively narrow their conception of acceptable peace, let alone a fair peace, especially as Israel treats its territorial expansion as a fait accompli and normalizes relations with Arab countries that had previously fought for the Palestinian cause. “Palestinians wonder whether they are always doomed to accept what they have previously refused just to find that it is no more an offer — if it ever was an offer — again to be faced with new attempts to extort new concessions from them for an undefined future,” writes Palestinian diplomat Afif Safieh in his 2011 book, ​​The Peace Process: From Breakthrough to Breakdown.Here is what you need to know about the history of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and why they have repeatedly failed.In 1967, Israel fought Egypt, Syria, and Jordan in the Six-Day War, a brief but intense conflict over water, land, and Palestine. Israel defeated the three Arab states, capturing Gaza, the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula, parts of East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. Following the conflict, the UN adopted Resolution 242, which calls on Arab countries to recognize Israel’s right to “live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force,” as well as for Israel to withdraw from “territories occupied” in the conflict — essentially, to revert to its pre-1967 borders, a provision that Israel has since resisted. Israel, Egypt, and Jordan all came to accept the resolution, ushering in temporary peace between them. Egypt and Jordan recognized Israel’s existence and ceased direct hostilities with the country, though Israel didn’t uphold its part of the deal, never fully reverting to its pre-1967 borders — a choice that led to the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Still, achieving buy-in from Arab nations that were once hostile to Israel was a significant step toward opening formal Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The resolution was later affirmed in 1973 in UN Resolution 338, which, along with resolution 242, served as the foundation of peace talks in the region for decades to come.The Camp David Accords established long-lasting (but cold) peace between Egypt and Israel, and also had a significant impact on the trajectory of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The Accords, brokered by then-US President Jimmy Carter, came after a ceasefire in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which Egypt and Syria fought Israel, hoping to regain territory lost in previous conflicts. As part of the deal, Egypt and Israel agreed to refrain from use of force to resolve their disputes, and Israel agreed to a path toward returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. (Syria signed a separate disengagement agreement with Israel.) Israel and Egypt also addressed the fate of Palestinians: They reiterated their commitment to UN Resolutions 242 and 338. Both countries called for Palestinians to participate in future negotiations, “full autonomy” for people in the West Bank and Gaza, a provisional government in those territories supported by Israeli security forces, and negotiations to determine Palestinians’ final status within five years. Palestinians were not formally invited to participate in the talks because the US refused to deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization, an umbrella group for Palestinian nationalists, so long as they refused to acknowledge Israel’s right to exist and to renounce terrorism.The Accords are considered a major watershed moment in Middle East peacemaking — earning then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat Nobel Peace Prizes — and provided a blueprint for subsequent negotiations.However, while Israel successfully kept the peace with Egypt, it did not abide by its commitments to Palestinians in the Accords. The five-year deadline for beginning to grant Palestinian people autonomy within the West Bank and Gaza came and went, and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories ballooned. Carter writes in his 2006 book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid that by “remov[ing] Egypt’s considerable strength from the military equation of the Middle East,” Israel “permitted itself renewed freedom to pursue the goals of a fervent and dedicated minority of its citizens to confiscate, settle, and fortify the occupied territories.” Historians — including Seth Anziska, author of the 2018 book Preventing Palestine — have also argued that the Accords had the effect of limiting remedies available to the Palestinians by focusing on establishing an ill-defined goal of “full autonomy” rather than sovereignty. Essentially, the Accords successfully kept war from breaking out between Israel and Egypt. But in the view of Carter and others critical of the deal’s limitations, the agreement also removed incentives Israel may have had to pursue peace with the Palestinians, setting the stage for the next few decades of difficulties.In 1987, Palestinian frustrations had reached a boiling point following Israel’s invasion of Lebanon to root out the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) presence there, the construction of new Israeli settlements, and increased repression by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians staged their First Intifada, Arabic for “shaking off,” engaging in nonviolent mass protests that often turned into violent clashes with Israeli security forces. It was amid this fighting that Hamas rose in prominence, initially committing to a nonviolent strategy alongside the PLO to facilitate peace talks. With the intifada unfolding, PLO leader Yasser Arafat, known as the father of Palestinian nationalism, made an announcement that paved the way for direct negotiations with the Israelis. Arafat said that the PLO, which had previously sought to defeat and replace the state of Israel — often via violent means, like airplane hijackings and bombings of Jewish civilians across the globe — had ‘’accepted the existence of Israel as a state in the region’’ and ‘’declared its rejection and condemnation of terrorism in all its forms.’’ “We accept two states, the Palestine state and the Jewish state of Israel,” he said.Though the initial reception from the US and Israel was icy, it was a significant capitulation. The PLO was still widely regarded as a terrorist group, including by the US, following the announcement. But it would begin to take a more active role in determining the future of the Palestinians. In 1991, representatives from the US, Soviet Union, Israel, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, as well as non-PLO Palestinian delegates, convened for the first time in Madrid to hold negotiations to create a new framework for the peace process. The conference was conceived by then-US Secretary of State James Baker to change course from a continued pattern of conflict during the final years of the First Intifada. There were still significant disagreements between the US and Israel around what peace should look like, particularly on settlement expansion, and no formal agreements came of the conference. But “what Madrid did achieve was significant,” write George Mitchell, former US President Barack Obama’s special envoy for Middle East peace, and Alon Sachar, a Middle East expert and former adviser to the US Ambassador to Israel, in the 2016 book A Path to Peace. That included bolstering public support for negotiations in Israel, which elected Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister in 1992 on a platform that focused on Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. Together, Rabin’s election and the hope generated in Madrid laid the groundwork for the first major breakthrough in decades.The year 1993 marked a breakthrough that established the modern peace process as we know it. The PLO and Israel entered secret negotiations —  facilitated by Norwegian politicians through a think tank in Oslo — at a moment when both felt backed into a corner. Israel was facing increasing international pressure to engage in peace talks following its violent clampdowns on Palestinian protesters in the intifada. And the PLO was weakened after supporting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein before his defeat by US and international forces in the First Gulf War. The fall of the Soviet Union had also reduced Cold War tensions in the Middle East that had previously made peacemaking difficult.The secret talks allowed the negotiators to discuss difficult issues without fear of political blowback. After some progress had been made, the Israelis elevated them to official, public negotiations in Oslo. Then-US President Bill Clinton had a limited role in the negotiations, but held a formal signing ceremony for the so-called Oslo Accords on the White House lawn in Washington, DC, in 1993, in which Rabin and Arafat famously shook hands. The Accords allowed Palestinians to self-govern in the West Bank and Gaza and established the Palestinian Authority as the government of those areas. Israel agreed to withdraw its security forces from Gaza and “redeploy” those located in the West Bank in phases. In exchange, the PLO formally recognized the state of Israel and the right of its citizens to live in peace, accepting the language of UN Resolution 242. “To this day Palestinians refer to their acquiescence to 242 as their historic compromise, the moment they accepted partition,” Mitchell and Sachar write. Critically, the PLO failed to limit Israel’s continued military presence in Gaza and the West Bank in key ways. The agreement provided no timeline for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and gave Israelis exclusive jurisdiction over their settlements in the occupied territories. At this time, the settler population there exceeded 280,000 and would increase by almost 70,000 in the following five years. Meanwhile, the Palestinians were left to manage their own affairs, including administering security and public services, relieving Israel of “formal responsibility for the living conditions and welfare of the territories’ rapidly increasing population, still completely dominated by Israeli forces,” Carter writes. The Accords also established a five-year interim period in which the thornier issues of the conflict were meant to be resolved once and for all: the fate of a Palestinian state and its borders, whether Palestinian refugees would be able to return to Israel or the Palestinian territories or be compensated, what would happen to Israeli settlers and Jerusalem, and water usage. But that would never come to be. Oslo II built on the momentum of the first Oslo agreement, which was received positively by both Palestinians and Israelis. In September 1995, Rabin and Arafat convened to sign a second agreement in DC that divided the West Bank into three zones, labeled Areas A, B, and C, keeping Gaza continuous. The hope was that, eventually, the Palestinian state would be formed in these areas.The newly created Palestinian Authority (PA) was given full control over Area A, which encompassed the Palestinian cities of Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus, and Bethlehem. In Area B, which spans a dense zone around those Area A cities, the Palestinian Authority was to have civil jurisdiction in partnership with Israel, which would administer security. Area C, which represented most of the West Bank (and encompassed all of the settlements that Israel had built since it captured the territory in 1967) was to be administered entirely by Israel. Israel was still permitted to collect taxes from the many Palestinians living anywhere in the West Bank and Gaza if they worked in Israel, which it would then distribute to the PA. The Israelis had agreed to withdraw from most of Gaza ahead of Oslo II.Rabin also agreed that Israel would withdraw from Areas A and B within three months of the signing of the agreement, and would negotiate further withdrawals in the five-year interim period established in the first Oslo agreement. Radicals on both sides sought to prevent both Oslo I and II’s implementation. Rabin, who had become the face of the peace movement in Israel, was assassinated by a Jewish extremist who opposed the Accords just months later. A period of heightened attacks by Hamas followed. Public support for the peace process eroded, leading to Netanyahu’s election as prime minister in 1996. He opposed the Oslo Accords, arguing they only encouraged attacks like those Hamas was launching at the time, and that Israel needed to take a hard line against the Palestinians. He also distrusted the PLO’s Arafat, a feeling that was mutual. Netanyahu’s first government wasn’t as far right as his latest one, but decisions he made in the years to come would make negotiations increasingly difficult. Following Rabin’s assassination and Netanyahu’s election, the Accords were threatened, and Clinton tried to salvage the negotiations by inviting Arafat and Netanyahu to Maryland’s Wye River plantation in 1998. There, the leaders agreed to additional Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank as well as Palestinians taking measures to prevent violence against Israel — but both sides accused each other of failing to properly implement the agreement. That contributed to a deteriorating political situation in Israel, where Netanyahu was facing criticism from the left for failing to make enough progress on negotiations and from the right for making what they saw as unreasonable territorial concessions. Netanyahu was subsequently voted out in 1999, with Ehud Barak taking his place as prime minister and promising an agreement with the Palestinians within 15 months. At Barak’s urging, Clinton held another summit at Camp David in July 2000, where the leaders failed to come to an agreement on borders, Jerusalem, and Palestinian refugees’ “right of return.” Why they failed is a subject of disagreement: Clinton and other pro-Israel voices have blamed Arafat, arguing that he was unwilling to make peace, while others say the negotiations were designed to fail because they didn’t meet the “minimum requirements of any Palestinian leader,” as Robert Malley, one of the US negotiators, argued several years later. It was nevertheless a blow to Barak, who would not survive long as prime minister. The failures of Camp David led Clinton to undertake a last ditch effort to salvage negotiations before he left office. At the outset of a Second Intifada, which would prove more bloody than the last, Clinton proposed his own parameters for peace. In Clinton’s plan, 80 percent of Israeli settlers would remain in the West Bank, covering about 10 percent of the occupied land. Israel would have exclusive access to the utilities and certain roads that serviced them and would be allowed to create a security perimeter around the settlements. Palestinians would get some land adjacent to Gaza in exchange.The rest of the West Bank would go to the new state of Palestine, which would also encompass all of Gaza. The new country would be demilitarized and supported by an international force. Palestinians would control the Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, including what is known to Muslims as the al-Aqsa Mosque, and Israelis would control the Western Wall. Displaced Palestinians from around the world would have the right to return to the West Bank and Gaza, but not to their former homes in any land owned by Israel. Israel has generally opposed a right of return for Palestinians, which it “views as a tactic to undermine Jewish self-determination,” Mitchell and Sachar write. The return of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced in 1948 would erode Israel’s Jewish demographic majority.Israel accepted the framework with reservations that Clinton said were “within [his] parameters.” Arafat also accepted the parameters but with reservations that Clinton deemed incongruous with an agreement. Part of the problem for Arafat was that the parameters required too many Palestinian concessions on land for settlers and on right of return, some foreign affairs experts have argued. Clinton later wrote in his memoir that Arafat had made an “error of historic proportions.”Carter saw Arafat’s decision differently, writing that “there was no possibility that any Palestinian leader could accept such terms and survive, but official statements from Washington and Jerusalem were successful in placing the entire onus for the failure on Yasser Arafat.” This was the closest that the Israelis and Palestinians have come in recent years to achieving a peace agreement. The Second Intifada, which ended with a ceasefire in 2003 following significant loss of life, made official peace overtures difficult. But several initiatives that were not orchestrated by Israeli or Palestinian government representatives were nevertheless pursued during this period. That included the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative proposed by the Saudi Crown Prince, which proposed Arab nations’ recognition of Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from the occupied territories, among other elements of a peace plan. It was embraced by many Arab countries and Palestinian leaders, but dismissed by the new Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s government as a “nonstarter” just as it was launching a major invasion of the West Bank in response to the Second Intifada. There was also the 2003 Geneva Initiative, spearheaded by former Israeli and Palestinian officials, which aimed to provide a comprehensive plan for implementation of a two-state solution based on the framework discussed in the Clinton Parameters and the Arab Peace Initiative. It was also rejected by Sharon. The US, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations — together, the Quartet — also announced a roadmap for peace in 2003 that described progressive steps toward a two-state solution over the course of three years, with political, security, economic, humanitarian, and institution-building benchmarks. The roadmap was grounded in then-US President George W. Bush’s belief that Palestinian militant violence was a primary obstacle to peace. He and the international community therefore demanded that Arafat step aside in favor of new Palestinian leadership to continue negotiations. At the time, there were still significant numbers of suicide bombings on Israeli and Jewish targets committed by Palestinian militants. Arafat agreed to step aside; the more moderate Mahmoud Abbas replaced him. The Palestinians accepted the roadmap — despite the fact that Bush had made assurances to the Israelis that they would not be expected to totally withdraw from the occupied territories and that Palestinians would not have right of return to Israel. But the Israeli government, led by Sharon, demanded prerequisites that ultimately doomed the deal. Those included dismantling all Palestinian militant groups, precluding any reference to UN Resolution 242, and barring discussion of Israeli settlements. “The practical result of all this is that the Roadmap for Peace had become moot,” Carter writes. Despite previously advocating for expansionist policies in the occupied territories, Sharon announced an Israeli “disengagement plan” for Gaza in 2005 that involved the unilateral withdrawal of Israeli settlements and military forces. However, Israel maintained control of the Gazan airspace and cooperated with Egypt in administering its border with Gaza. Approximately 8,500 Israeli settlers — some of whom had lived there for decades and resisted the plan — were removed from their homes, and some were compensated. Israel ceded control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, who was elected its president that year. Israel also vacated four Israeli settlements in the West Bank.The move was surprising from Sharon, who had for years pursued a dream of a “Greater Israel,” understood by many Israelis as their biblical lands that encompass the Palestinian territories. It earned him a reputation as a peacemaker who was seeking to deescalate the situation. But as Dartmouth professor Bernard Avishai later argued in the New Yorker, the decision was “not meant to precede a negotiated settlement of any kind but to obviate the need for one.” Sharon wanted to “cut Israel’s losses” in Gaza, Avishai argues, while pursuing his long-term goals of annexing Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, and all major Israeli settlements in the West Bank, pushing the Palestinians well beyond Israel’s 1967 borders and behind the illegal “separation barrier” he had built. Sharon, however, suffered from a stroke soon after that would leave him incapable of fully carrying out that vision.Hamas won a majority in the PA in the 2006 elections following the withdrawal. The US refused to recognize their new government and pressured Abbas’s government to overturn the results, helping spark a brief civil war that culminated in the group taking control of Gaza while the PA, led by politicians aligned with Abbas, continued to govern in the West Bank. After the schism in the Palestinian government, Ehud Olmert, who became Israel’s prime minister after Sharon suffered from a stroke, decided to reopen peace talks with the PA in Annapolis, Maryland, for the first time since 2000. Hamas supported the talks and was prepared to reverse its policy of rejecting Israel if an agreement that the Palestinian people would approve of could be finalized.Olmert presented a proposal to Abbas that included significant territorial concessions, though the exact contours of the proposal are vague and were never fully disclosed. Reportedly, Olmert offered Palestinians 5.8 percent of Israeli land, consisting of lightly populated farmland, in exchange for 6.3 percent of the West Bank, encompassing major Israeli settlements. On other issues, however, there appeared to still be significant gaps between the Israeli and Palestinian positions on refugees, Jerusalem, and an Israeli withdrawal.Abbas did not accept the proposal, later saying he wasn’t provided enough detail, though Olmert speculates that Abbas was “entirely for it” and believes Abbas likely regrets that he did not sign the deal. In that respect, Abbas’s rejection of the offer is sometimes compared to Arafat’s reaction to the Clinton Parameters: It was “the best an Israeli prime minister had ever offered to a Palestinian leader” in terms of territory, Mitchell and Sachar write. But Abbas later stated that he believed the offer did not meet Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.Some reports suggest that Abbas was also concerned about the political situation in Israel at the time, as Olmert had announced his intention to resign over corruption allegations. Olmert later served a prison sentence for accepting bribes and committing obstruction of justice. Netanyahu succeeded him and rejected the talks as dangerous for Israel, raising questions as to whether he would have honored any agreement signed.  Obama’s presidency began in 2009 with the ending of a Gaza war, known as Israel’s Operation Cast Lead, and he appointed George Mitchell, co-author of the 2016 book A Path to Peace, to shepherd peace talks. But the Israeli government was skeptical of Obama, and the heft Mitchell brought as a former negotiator with Northern Ireland did not directly translate to Israel and Palestine.It quickly became clear Obama’s peace overtures weren’t working. Senior US officials had begun warning that because of the pace of Israel’s settlement expansion, the horizon of the two-state outcome was approaching, and human rights organizations were increasingly calling the situation in the West Bank apartheid. US Secretary of State John Kerry put his hat in the ring, setting a deadline of mid-2014 to reach a comprehensive agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.Kerry started with a series of confidence-building measures: Israel agreed to progressively release Palestinian prisoners in four parts while Palestinians agreed to halt the process of applying for membership as a country in international bodies. However, when Israel refused to release the fourth group of prisoners and continued to expand its settlements, Abbas reacted by applying for Palestine to be recognized by 15 UN and other international bodies. Both sides also faced opposition within their own camps. Hamas rejected the talks, saying that Abbas had no authority to negotiate on behalf of Palestinians since no formal elections had been held in the Palestinian territories since 2005. The group called for a third intifada, though it never materialized.Netanyahu’s Likud party proposed legislation to annex the Jordan Valley in direct contradiction of the US’s proposal during the talks that the area go to Palestinians. Hardliners also threatened to resign from Netanyahu’s government if he agreed to Israel’s 1967 borders as a starting point for negotiations. These challenges led to a breakdown in the talks in April 2014. Former President Donald Trump severely undermined the prospect of Palestinian autonomy, delivering several major wins for Israel that poisoned dialogue with the Palestinians. He recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights, which Syria says should rightfully be its property — a decision later reaffirmed under Biden. He reversed decades of US policy and moved the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018 — a decision made in recognition of the fact that Israel had made unified Jerusalem its capital, but that ignores Palestinian claims on East Jerusalem that are recognized by the UN. It’s now incredibly politically difficult for any American president to move the embassy back to Tel Aviv. The Trump administration also argued in 2019 that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are not necessarily illegal, lending legitimacy to Israel’s claims on the territories. Israel’s annexations and settlements are widely regarded as illegal under international law, and no other country has recognized them.Though Trump unveiled a plan in 2020 that he hailed as the peace “deal of the century,” Palestinians vehemently rejected it. The proposal would have allowed Israel to absorb the vast majority of settlements in the occupied West Bank, home to more than half a million Israelis, required that Palestine be fully demilitarized, and rejected Palestinian refugees’ right of return outright. It would have also recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, while also impossibly recognizing Jerusalem as the “undivided capital” of Israel.“We say a thousand nos to the Deal of The Century,” Abbas said at the time. Trump’s barefaced pro-Israel policies undermined the US’s ability to credibly moderate peace talks going forward. There’s also no one credible representative for Palestinians across the occupied territories with which to negotiate. Polling in recent years but before Hamas’s October 7 attack has shown that the PA, under Abbas’s leadership, is broadly unpopular when compared with Hamas, and as Mitchell and Sachar note, has become seen as “behaving like a security subcontractor easing the burden for Israel of the occupation.” That’s partially by the design of Netanyahu, who has propped up Hamas at the expense of a unified Palestinian voice in peace talks.Even if there were strong representatives, Trump wasn’t interested in pursuing a peace plan. His administration created the Abraham Accords, which were normalization deals between Israel and Arab states like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco (Arab states that had previously not recognized Israel); such deals did not include any progress on the Palestinian issue. Biden took up this policy, and his team put a major emphasis on bringing Saudi Arabia into the normalization fold during his first two and a half years in office. This Trump-Biden approach went against the Arab Peace Initiative and cut Palestinians out of the conversation. For years after Trump announced his framework, no meaningful attempts were made to reopen peace negotiations, with US President Joe Biden looking to turn his attention to other parts of the world, including China and Russia, and Israel signing normalization agreements with some of its Arab neighbors.  But that calculus changed with the onset of the war in Gaza. The Biden administration has offered its nearly unconditional support to Israel, but has raised concerns about Israel’s ability to achieve its stated goal of eliminating Hamas and its methods as civilian casualties skyrocket. It has also called for a renewed commitment to a two-state solution. The Biden administration’s focus on a two-state solution raises the question as to whether the window for that path to peace has passed. Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories has become entrenched, and its settler population in the West Bank has grown to at least 700,000, leading some observers — including Carter — to argue that the reality is that Israel and Palestine are a de facto one state.“A system of apartheid, with two peoples occupying the same land but completely separated from each other, with Israelis totally dominant and suppressing violence by depriving Palestinians of their basic human rights. This is the policy now being followed,” Carter wrote in his 2006 book. As the war continues, Biden has called on Israel to disentangle itself from Palestine, and has warned the country against trying to occupy Gaza once it concludes its offensive. But Following Hamas’s October 7 attack and the destruction Israel has wreaked in Gaza, reversing the status quo now seems more difficult than ever.

How did Israel become a country in the first place?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:European Jews arrived at Zionism partly because of rising antisemitic persecution.Editor’s note, October 8, 2023: This story was last updated on May 14, 2018, and some information in it may no longer be accurate. For all of Vox’s latest coverage on Israel and Palestine, see our storystream.Social and political developments in Europe convinced Jews they needed their own country, and their ancestral homeland seemed like the right place to establish it. European Jews — 90 percent of all Jews at the time — arrived at Zionism partly because of rising antisemitic persecution and partly because the Enlightenment introduced Jews to secular nationalism. Between 1896 and 1948, hundreds of thousands of Jews resettled from Europe to what was then British-controlled Palestine, including large numbers forced out of Europe during the Holocaust.Many Arabs saw the influx of Jews as a European colonial movement, and the two peoples fought bitterly. The British couldn’t control the violence, and in 1947 the United Nations voted to split the land into two countries. Almost all of the roughly 650,000 Jews went to the blue territory on the map to the right, and a majority of the Arab population (roughly twice the size of the Jewish community) went to the orange.The Jewish residents accepted the deal. The Palestinians, who saw the plan as an extension of a long-running Jewish attempt to push them out of the land, fought it. The Arab states of Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Syria all later declared war on Israel, as well (albeit not to defend the Palestinians).Israeli forces defeated the Palestinian militias and Arab armies in a vicious conflict that turned 700,000 Palestinian civilians into refugees. The UN partition promised 56 percent of British Palestine for the Jewish state; by the end of the war, Israel possessed 77 percent — everything except the West Bank and the eastern quarter of Jerusalem (controlled by Jordan), as well as the Gaza Strip (controlled by Egypt). It left Israelis with a state, but not Palestinians.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The US just brokered another peace deal for Israel, this time with Sudan",2020-10-23,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:The US is giving Sudan financial help in exchange for recognizing Israel.President Donald Trump announced Friday that Sudan has become the third country to normalize relations with Israel during the Trump administration, underscoring how the president’s diplomatic efforts in the Middle East may prove to be the most significant foreign policy achievement of his first term.Trump, along with the leaders of Israel and Sudan, proclaimed a new agreement during a Friday call. “The state of Israel and the Republic of Sudan have agreed to make peace,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump on the phone for the outcome, saying “We are expanding the circle of peace so rapidly with your leadership.” Trump responded: “There are many, many more coming.”A statement by the nation’s three leaders released by the White House provided more details. “The leaders agreed to the normalization of relations between Sudan and Israel and to end the state of belligerence between their nations,” it reads. In return, “The United States will take steps to restore Sudan’s sovereign immunity and to engage its international partners to reduce Sudan’s debt burdens.”Furthermore, “The United States and Israel also committed to working with their partners to support the people of Sudan in strengthening their democracy, improving food security, countering terrorism and extremism, and tapping into their economic potential.”At its core, then, the deal looks like a trade where the US and Israel give Sudan financial support in exchange for diplomatic normalization.The announcement follows Trump administration-brokered deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates in August and Bahrain last month. Before that, the last peace deal Israel struck with an Arab country was with Jordan in 1994 (it signed one with Egypt in 1979). But the deal with Sudan is arguably more significant. The UAE and Bahrain weren’t at war with Israel when they signed their agreements; Sudan and Israel were. That means while the first two pacts were normalization deals, this one with Sudan could potentially be described more accurately as a peace deal.It’s yet another win for Trump’s foreign policy, providing him with good news ahead of a bitter reelection fight.It took a bit of maneuvering to make this agreement happen. On Wednesday, a joint US-Israeli delegation traveled to Sudan for talks with the government. Two days later, Trump removed the Arab-led North African nation from America’s state sponsors of terrorism list. It’s a move he promised to make once the country paid $335 million to American victims of terror for the country’s harboring of Osama bin Laden in the 1990s.The UAE also played a role in the negotiations, as Sudan asked the country — and the US — for billions in economic aid as part of signing this deal. That makes sense, as the country is desperately in need of cash. Whether the US and UAE start funneling money into Sudan remains to be seen.A political earthquake in Sudan also made the announcement possible. A protest movement kicked Sudan’s Islamist leaders out of power last year, ushering in a new military-led government that wants to end its global pariah status. Making amends with the US and saying it is no longer hostile to Israel is one way to do just that.“The US-Israel deal promises them the international recognition they crave without the inconvenience of democracy,” Alex de Waal, an expert on Sudanese politics, wrote for BBC News earlier this month.And, more broadly, regional politics in the greater Middle East have changed dramatically in recent years.Whereas the Israeli-Palestinian conflict once served as a major axis around which Middle East and Arab-government politics rotated, with many countries aligned with the Palestinians against Israel, that’s now changed. What animates the foreign policies of many Middle Eastern countries these days is the Arab-Israel standoff with Iran — which some have dubbed a “cold war.”With less need to bash Israel and back Palestine, Sudan had more freedom to strike the deal.For Israel and for Trump, that works just fine.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What is Jerusalem?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Israel’s current capital, which Palestinians claim part of for their future capital, is home to holy sites for both Judaism and Islam.Jerusalem is a city that straddles the border between Israel and the West Bank. It’s home to some of the holiest sites in both Judaism and Islam, and so both Israel and Palestine want to make it their capital. How to split the city fairly remains one of the fundamental issues dividing Israelis and Palestinians — and on December 6, President Donald Trump weighed in on Israel’s side.For the first 20 years of Israel’s existence, Jerusalem was divided. Israel controlled the parts of Jerusalem and its suburbs inside the red dotted line on this map, while Jordan controlled everything outside of it (blue dotted lines separate Jerusalem proper from suburbs):Jordan controlled the Temple Mount, a hill in the map’s brown splotch. The hill hosts the Western Wall, a retaining wall of an ancient Jewish temple and one of Judaism’s holiest sites, and two of Islam’s most important landmarks, the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Israeli Jews weren’t allowed to pray in the area while Jordan controlled it. During the 1967 war, Israel took control of East Jerusalem.Israel calls Jerusalem its undivided capital today, but almost no countries recognizes it as such. UN Security Council Resolution 478 condemns Israel’s decision to annex East Jerusalem as a violation of international law and calls for a compromise solution.The United States consistently refused to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, believing that a formal announcement could spark violence and would fatally undermine the US’ position as an honest broker between Israelis and Palestinians. President Trump decided to change that longstanding position in December. The new American policy recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and begin the process of moving the embassy, but still allows for negotiations over what parts of the city would be permanently Israeli and what parts would be given to Palestine in the event of a peace agreement.Assuming Trump’s policy doesn’t completely derail any chances for a peace process, there are still serious practical issues surrounding the division of Jerusalem. Not only is there an issue of ensuring Israeli and Palestinian access to the holy sites, but Jews have moved in and around Jerusalem in huge numbers. They now make up about two-thirds of the city:The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."

"Hezbollah’s role in the Israel-Hamas war, explained",2023-10-28,Vox,['Nicole Narea'],"Filed under:Why would Hezbollah enter the fight against Israel?The leader of Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party, has not ruled out escalating its ongoing fight against Israel as that country expands its ground operations in Gaza.In a highly anticipated televised speech Friday, Hassan Nasrallah said that Hezbollah — which has previously vowed to destroy Israel — has already entered the fray. Hezbollah has increasingly traded fire with Israel along its northern border with Lebanon in the most significant escalation in violence since Israel fought Hezbollah in a bloody 2006 war. Over the past few weeks, some 30,000 people have fled southern Lebanon in anticipation of further violence. Hezbollah’s next steps, Nasrallah said, depend on what Israel does in Gaza. According to Nasrallah, a ceasefire would prevent broader regional war, but he did not elaborate on what other actions Israel might take to ensure Hezbollah doesn’t more fully enter the war.  He did add that the US bears responsibility for the war in Gaza — but also has the power to stop it. “All scenarios are open on our Lebanese southern front,” Nasrallah said. “All options are laid out and we can adopt any at any point in time.”Hezbollah counts Hamas — the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza and launched the October 7 attack on Israel — as an ally. Both groups are designated as terrorist organizations by many countries. After Israel responded with its siege and onslaught of airstrikes on Gaza, one of Hezbollah’s top officials had a message for Palestinians trapped there: “Our hearts are with you. Our minds are with you. Our souls are with you. Our history and guns and our rockets are with you.”But even after Nasrallah’s speech, it’s not clear that Hezbollah, with its extensive military experience and estimated arsenal of as many as 120,000 missiles, wants to be responsible for starting a regional war. Should Hezbollah open a front against Israel, it would be costly for both sides as well as for their international allies, and the US has stationed aircraft carriers nearby in the Mediterranean to remind the organization of that, though Nasrallah noted Friday that Hezbollah remains unintimidated.Nasrallah previously held talks with senior Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad leaders in which they concluded that they share a goal of seeking “a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine” and stopping Israel’s “treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the West Bank,” according to a statement they released after. But the groups did not elaborate further on their intentions. It’s a delicate moment for Hezbollah, an organization whose primary goal is eliminating the state of Israel but that has also amassed significant political power in Lebanon that it is fearful of losing. “They can take the whole region into a very hard war,” said Abed Kanaaneh, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Tel Aviv University and author of Understanding Hezbollah: The Hegemony of Resistance. “But they have their own interests, and they need to sustain their popularity in Lebanon. So they have their own calculations to make.”Hezbollah was founded in Lebanon in 1982 by men inspired by former Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s radical brand of Shia theology. The organization was among many that resisted Israel’s invasion of Lebanon that year following an assassination attempt on the Israeli ambassador to Britain orchestrated by Palestinian militants. Though the assassination was carried out by a rebel offshoot of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a militant group, Israel sought to eliminate all Palestinian militant groups operating from Lebanon. Following bloody fighting that left more than 17,000 dead, Israel succeeded in driving out those militants through a US-brokered agreement in 1983, which brought an official end to the war and allowed the PLO to relocate to Tunisia. But Israel continued to occupy Lebanon, creating a militarized security zone in the south that it maintained until 2000 with the stated purpose of protecting Israelis from attacks by Lebanese militants. The occupation, however, “creat[ed] conditions for the establishment and proliferation of Hezbollah,” by angering and radicalizing the local Shia community, wrote Augustus Richard Norton in his book, Hezbollah: A Short History.Israel set up permanent infrastructure in the security zone — military bases, new roads, road signs in Hebrew, and detention camps that Norton notes became notorious for their brutality. When militant groups including a fledgling Hezbollah tried to drive out the Israeli forces, civilians were caught in the crossfire. Meanwhile, Iran was nurturing Hezbollah, offering it training, funding, and weapons. The Iranian government saw Hezbollah as a vehicle to indirectly attack Israel, which it regarded as an illegitimate state and encapsulation of Western imperialism, as well as a promising group that could spread their ideas of Shia Islamic revolution across the Middle East. The willingness of Hezbollah’s early leaders to pledge loyalty to Iran’s then-leaders helped facilitate bonds as well.Hezbollah shares Iran’s Shia revolutionary ideology, and they both support Palestinians and oppose Israel. But there is disagreement among experts as to how much Iran is really calling the shots with Hezbollah. Some say Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy; Thanassis Cambanis, director of Century International and author of A Privilege to Die: Inside Hezbollah’s Legions and Their Endless War Against Israel, said their relationship can be described as “very closely allied and ideologically aligned with a lot of shared interests,” but Hezbollah also has a “great deal of its own autonomy” and “shouldn’t be understood as a traditional proxy.” Nasrallah himself sought to put distance between Hezbollah and Iran as well as Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel in his Friday speech. Iran has continued to fund Hezbollah over the years, and while it’s unclear exactly how much the organization has received, the US State Department estimates it at hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Most of that goes to Hezbollah’s military wing, and that figure includes weapons supplied by Iran, including an arsenal of drones and rockets. But Hezbollah also has other revenue sources, both legal and illegal: through the Lebanese state, smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of organized crime.  Hezbollah laid out its ideology in a 1985 document addressed to the “Downtrodden in Lebanon and in the World.” It identified the United States and the Soviet Union as being among “the countries of the arrogant world” that inflict suffering on those less powerful, and explicitly rejected both the East and the West. It accused the US of using Israel as a “spearhead” against Muslims in Lebanon, and justified fighting the US, often by violent means, as an exercise of its “legitimate right to defend our Islam and the dignity of our nation.” It laid out a vision for Lebanon as an Iranian-style theocracy, though it emphasized the goal of Lebanese self-determination. And finally, it opposed any attempts to negotiate with Israel, seeking the country’s withdrawal from Lebanon as the first step toward “its final obliteration from existence and the liberation of venerable Jerusalem from the talons of occupation.” The document made clear Hezbollah saw (and still sees) Israel’s existence as a threat to Muslims throughout the region. In that sense, it found common ground with Sunni Muslim militant groups like Hamas, though Hamas’s reasons for wanting Israel destroyed were slightly different, focusing less on regional factors than on the establishment of an independent state in historical Palestine.Hezbollah has hewed closely to this agenda in the years since, even as it has evolved from a guerrilla group to a more professionalized resistance organization, political party, and provider of social services in Lebanon. It did, however, temper its Islamist rhetoric somewhat in an updated 2009 manifesto, noting that making diverse Lebanon into a state that follows Islamic law is an unrealistic goal and affirming a commitment to “the achievement of true democracy.”At present, Hezbollah has some 20,000 estimated active members and is popular among the Shia, who represent about a third of the Lebanese population. The most heavily armed non-state actor in the world, Hezbollah has a large arsenal of long-range missiles that can reach well within Israel’s borders, as well as a comprehensive air defense system and commando force. It has refused to give up its arms despite repeated domestic and international calls for disarmament, arguing that it needs its weapons so long as Israel continues to occupy what it claims is Lebanese territory in the Golan Heights (territory that Israel annexed in a move that has been recognized only by the US and no other country).Now, Hezbollah faces the challenge of balancing its revolutionary aims with governance — and Nasrallah, who has been at the helm of Hezbollah since 1992, has at times been criticized within Lebanon and the greater Arab world for putting too much weight on the former. But Nasrallah has also proved a charismatic leader and orator who has bolstered Hezbollah’s legitimacy through a sophisticated communication strategy and has overcome harsh criticism before.“They are cosmopolitan and seasoned professionals, even in pursuit of problematic goals,” said Cambanis. The US designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. Many other countries and organizations have followed suit, though some, including the European Union, distinguish between Hezbollah’s political and militant arms. Some argue that’s a distinction without a difference. Unlike Hamas — in which the political and military leadership are separate and operate out of different locations — Hezbollah is a “very centrally controlled, unified organization,” Cambanis said.“Their political leaders all have a military background,” he said. “Their resistance structure, to use their term, necessitates the armed struggle and the political struggle being inextricable.” Hezbollah became associated with terrorism in the 1980s, during a time when it rejected the notion of participating in Lebanese politics. It viewed the political system, which was designed to split power between the country’s largest religious groups based on their size at the end of France’s dominion, as irredeemably corrupt and unfair. So Hezbollah dedicated itself to pursuing the objective of replacing the secular government with an Islamist one. Its first step was ridding Lebanon of the foreign influences it believed to be the source of political strife: France and the US. Both countries had deployed peacekeeping forces to Lebanon amid the 1982 Israeli invasion and outbreak of civil war. From the US perspective, the most devastating terrorist attack was a 1983 suicide bombing on its military barracks in Beirut, an event that killed more than 300 American and French troops and Lebanese civilians. The Americans blamed Hezbollah for the attack and pulled all of their forces from the country. There was also the June 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847 to Beirut, in which militants who later escaped without being captured killed a passenger and threatened to kill more unless Israel released hundreds of Lebanese prisoners. (Hezbollah denies involvement in either incident.) Between 1982 and 1992, Hezbollah took more than 100 foreign hostages, mostly Westerners, seemingly with the aim of winning concessions from Western countries. In one such incident, known as the Iran-Contra affair, then-US President Ronald Reagan traded weapons to Iran, which was then subject to an arms embargo, for the release of hostages held by Hezbollah. Hezbollah also kidnapped Israeli soldiers, conducted cross-border raids on the Israeli border, and fired rockets and missiles into Israel, again with the goal of ending Israel’s occupation. Those tactics continued through the 1990s, even as Hezbollah changed its strategy and decided to enter politics. Hezbollah members were elected to the Lebanese Parliament for the first time in 1992, following the end of the 15-year Lebanese civil war that had seen various religious and secular subgroups clash. It was then that Lebanese leaders associated with Hezbollah came to recognize the “need to come to a modus vivendi with the state rather than remain outside the political system and judge it as abhorrent in strictly Islamic terms,” Norton wrote. Interestingly, Hezbollah built its political following on non-religious themes, which Norton identifies as “battling economic exploitation and underdevelopment, inequities in the political system, personal freedom and opportunity, and, of course, security.” But it wasn’t until after 2000, when Israel finally withdrew from the security zone it had established in southern Lebanon, that Hezbollah really gained popularity. Though Israeli leaders insisted that their withdrawal from Lebanon was a unilateral political decision, many Lebanese credited Hezbollah with driving out the army by stepping up its attacks. That — along with Hezbollah’s investment in schools, clinics, youth programs, and other social services — drove up the organization’s profile in Lebanon. It went on to progressively gain seats in Parliament over the years and to run a coalition government alongside its sometimes political rival Amal, which also draws its power from Lebanon’s Shia community. In the most recent Lebanese elections in 2022, Hezbollah won 13 of 128 seats, though the party and its allies lost their majority. Still, Hezbollah’s emergence as a political force didn’t mean that the group abandoned its violent tactics, at times undermining its authority as a resistance group. For instance, the United Nations found that four Hezbollah members were responsible for the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a car bombing that also killed 21 bystanders. And in 2006, the organization killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others in a cross-border raid. It failed to anticipate the disproportionate Israeli response and the ensuing war, which claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis. Neither side won; a UN-brokered ceasefire ended the conflict after a little over a month.Hezbollah has also proved willing to enact violence at the behest of Iran’s proxy networks, especially following its involvement in the Syrian civil war defending the Assad regime and after the 2020 assassination of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Hezbollah has deployed militants to other countries — including Iraq and Yemen — to train these proxy groups and fight alongside them.Along with Iran, Hezbollah is closely linked to Syria, though their relationship has been more one of convenience than shared ideology. Syria has long served as a conduit for weapons supply lines between Iran and Syria. As a result and at Iran’s urging, Nasrallah committed Hezbollah to “do everything in [its] power” to protect dictator Bashar al-Assad’s government from largely Sunni rebel groups after civil war broke out in 2011. Hezbollah helped turn the tide of the war in Assad’s favor. When they withdrew most of their forces from Syria in 2019, they left arguably stronger militarily than they were before — raising concerns that they could pose a formidable foe should they enter the conflict with Israel.Although Hezbollah’s military wing came out of the last two decades of conflict battle-hardened, its violent adventurism has caused its political wing a lot of harm. Hezbollah lost some of its luster domestically and regionally as a result of the 2006 war’s death and destruction. In addition to the many casualties, Israeli attacks led to $2.8 billion in direct damage. While Hezbollah (using funding from Iran) poured hundreds of millions of dollars into compensation and rebuilding efforts, Lebanon still took years to recover. The organization’s involvement in Syria hurt it politically, too. In Lebanon, voters believed that foreign intervention had come at the expense of their domestic concerns, and throughout the region, Sunnis expressed great disillusionment with Hezbollah; they saw the group as having propped up Assad, a vicious leader who routinely oppresses his people.In recent years, Hezbollah’s political capital has been further reduced by political issues. Mass protests spurred by economic troubles undermined support for Hezbollah and the country’s political elites in 2019. Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned under public pressure, despite Hezbollah’s desire to keep him in office. Hezbollah members actively sought to suppress the protest movement, setting fire to a camp of anti-government protesters.Hezbollah’s popularity again took a hit following the 2020 explosion of a Beirut port, which the organization controlled. The group also resisted calls for an international investigation of the incident, much to the chagrin of the Lebanese public. Ahead of the 2022 elections, Hezbollah’s role in Lebanon’s general political instability had many of its opponents deeply frustrated.Even before these issues, Hezbollah was a polarizing force in Lebanese society. The organization has solidified Shia support by being effective in local government and supporting social services but has often struggled to expand its sphere of influence. Lebanon is a fractured society, with different religious and secular groups jockeying for power, and Hezbollah is hated by those who oppose its worldview, with little room for a middle ground. “They are successful at winning very deep loyalty from their supporters,” Cambanis said. “And they’re successful at being able to violently coerce and intimidate their opponents.”In a 2021 Zogby/NC State University poll, 52 percent of Lebanese said they did not think Hezbollah promotes stability, though significant majorities of Shia, Druze, and Christians — all groups with leaders who’ve partnered with Hezbollah in the past — said that it did. The question is whether these cracks in Hezbollah’s support can be contained as the organization faces the prospect of an all-out war with Israel. “Lebanese are okay with the limited war that Hezbollah is [waging] against Israel right now, but if it will become total war or much deeper war, I can say that Hezbollah’s support will drop off,” Kanaaneh said. Hezbollah has been reluctant to engage Israel in open combat since the devastating 2006 war. But the situation in Gaza could change that. The main factor in its decision-making will be how ground operations in Gaza play out and to what extent Israel further brutalizes the civilian population. Hezbollah has “built their own narrative and public image of being part of the resistance axis” around the Palestinian cause, and it would be difficult for them to stand by while Israel once again militarily occupies Gaza and attempts to eradicate their Sunni ally in Hamas — its link to the broader Islamic world, Kanaaneh said. In his speech, Nasrallah called Israel “weaker than a spider’s web” and made no guarantee that Hezbollah would limit fighting to their current levels on the Lebanese border, even as other Lebanese politicians urge Hezbollah against getting involved in a war that their country cannot afford. Still, the fact that Nasrallah did not immediately call for escalation is a sign that he may be heeding Lebanese protests.If Hezbollah gets involved in the war, it could play out much like the 2006 conflict where there were no victors, though it could potentially be even bloodier. In 2006, Hezbollah was estimated to have 12,000 missiles; now, it is thought to have 10 times that. Its troops have far more experience, including in urban combat, than they did before. Regardless of how any fighting turns out, “everybody will lose from this,” Kanaaneh said. That may include Kanaaneh himself: He lives in Israel near the Lebanese border.

Why some Palestinians believe social media companies are suppressing their posts,2023-10-29,Vox,['A.W. Ohlheiser'],"Filed under:Shadowbanning and the Israel-Hamas war, explained. “Algospeak” is an evasion tactic for automated moderation on social media, where users create new words to use in place of keywords that might get picked up by AI-powered filters. People might refer to dead as “unalive,” or sex as “seggs,” or porn as “corn” (or simply the corn emoji). There’s an algospeak term for Palestinians as well: “P*les+in1ans.” Its very existence speaks to a concern among many people posting and sharing pro-Palestine content during the war between Hamas and Israel that their posts are being unfairly suppressed. Some users believe their accounts, along with certain hashtags, have been “shadowbanned” as a result.

  Algospeak is just one of the user-developed methods of varying effectiveness that are supposed to dodge suppression on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. People might use unrelated hashtags, screenshot instead of repost, or avoid employing Arabic hashtags to attempt to evade apparent but unclear limitations on content about Palestine. It’s not clear whether these methods really work, but their spread among activists and around the internet speaks to the real fear of having this content hidden from the rest of the world. “Shadowbanning” gets thrown around a lot as an idea, is difficult to prove, and is not always easy to define. Below is a guide to its history, how it manifests, and what you as a social media user can do about it.  Shadowbanning is an often covert form of platform moderation that limits who sees a piece of content, rather than banning it altogether. According to a Vice dive into the history of the term, it likely originates as far back as the internet bulletin board systems of the 1980s.In its earliest iterations, shadowbanning worked kind of like a digital quarantine: Shadowbanned users could still log in and post to the community, but no one else could see their posts. They were present but contained. If someone was shadowbanned by one of the site’s administrators for posting awful things to a message board, they’d essentially be demoted to posting into nothingness, without knowing that was the case. Social media, as it evolved, upended how communities formed and gathered online, and the definition of shadowbanning expanded. People get seen online not just by creating an account and posting to a community’s virtual space, but by understanding how to get engagement through a site’s algorithms and discovery tools, by getting reshares from influential users, by purchasing ads, and by building followings of their own. Moderating became more complicated as users became savvier about getting seen and working around automated filters.At this point, shadowbanning has come to mean any “really opaque method of hiding users from search, from the algorithm, and from other areas where their profiles might show up,” said Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). A user might not know they’ve been shadowbanned. Instead, they might notice the effects: a sudden drop in likes or reposts, for instance. Their followers might also have issues seeing or sharing content a shadowbanned account posts. If you’re from the United States, you might know shadowbanning as a term thrown around by conservative activists and politicians who believe that social media sites — in particular Facebook and Twitter (now X) — have deliberately censored right-wing views. This is part of a years-long campaign that has prompted lawsuits and congressional hearings. While the evidence is slim that these platforms were engaging in systemic censorship of conservatives, the idea seems to catch on any time a platform takes action against a prominent right-wing account with a large following. The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a pair of cases challenging laws in Texas and Florida that restrict how social media companies can moderate their sites. War produces a swell of violent imagery, propaganda, and misinformation online, circulating at a rapid pace and triggering intense emotional responses from those who view it. That is inevitable. The concern from activists and digital rights observers is that content about Palestinians is not being treated fairly by the platforms’ moderation systems, leading to, among other things, shadowbanning. Outright account bans are pretty visible to both the account holder and anyone else on the platform. Some moderation tools designed to combat misinformation involve publicly flagging content with information boxes or warnings. Shadowbanning, by comparison, is not publicly labeled, and platforms might not tell a user that their account’s reach is limited, or why. Some users, though, have noticed signs that they might be shadowbanned after posting about Palestine. According to Mashable, these include Instagram users who saw their engagement crater after posting with their location set to Gaza in solidarity, sharing links to fundraisers to help people in Palestine, or posting content that is supportive of Palestinians.  Some digital rights organizations, including the EFF and 7amleh-The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement, are actively tracking potential digital rights violations of Palestinians during the conflict, particularly on Instagram, where some Palestinian activists have noticed troubling changes to how their content circulates in recent weeks.“These include banning the use of Arabic names for recent escalations [i.e., the Israel-Hamas war] while allowing the Hebrew name, restricting comments from profiles that are not friends, and…significantly reducing the visibility of posts, Reels, and stories,” Nadim Nashif, the co-founder and director of 7amleh, wrote in an email to Vox.In a statement, Meta said that the post visibility issues impacting some Palestinian users were due to a global “bug” and that some Instagram hashtags were no longer searchable because a portion of the content using it violated Meta rules. Meta’s statement does not name specific hashtags that have been limited under this policy.Mona Shtaya, a Palestinian digital rights activist, took to Instagram to characterize the hashtag shadowbans as a “collective punishment against people who share political thoughts or document human rights violations” that will negatively impact efforts to fact-check and share accurate information about the situation in Gaza. Shadowbanning is just one aspect of a broader problem that digital rights experts are tracking when it comes to potential bias in the enforcement of a platform’s rules. And this is not a new issue for pro-Palestinian content. Moderation bias “comes in a lot of different flavors, and it’s not always intentional,” York said. Platforms might underresource or incorrectly resource their language competency for a specific language, something that York said has long been an issue with how US-based platforms such as Meta moderate content in Arabic. “There might be significant numbers of Arabic-language content moderators, but they struggle because Arabic is across a number of different dialects,” she noted. Biases also emerge in how certain terms are classified by moderation algorithms. We know that this specific sort of bias can affect Palestinian content because it happened before. In 2021, during another escalation in conflict between Hamas and Israel, digital rights groups documented hundreds of content removals that seemed to unfairly target pro-Palestine sentiments. Meta eventually acknowledged that its systems were blocking references to the al-Aqsa Mosque, a holy site for Muslims that was incorrectly flagged in Meta’s systems as connected to terrorist groups. Meta commissioned an independent report into its moderation decisions during the 2021 conflict, which documented Meta’s weaknesses in moderating Arabic posts in context. It also found that Meta’s decisions “appear to have had an adverse human rights impact” on the rights of Palestinian users’ “freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, political participation, and non-discrimination.” In response to the report, Meta promised to review its relevant policies and improve its moderation of Arabic, including by recruiting more moderators with expertise in specific dialects. Meta’s current moderation of Israel-Hamas war content is being led by a centralized group with expertise in Hebrew and Arabic, the company said. Some content removals, they added, are going through without account “strikes” to avoid automatically banning accounts that have had content taken down in error. Claims of shadowbanning are associated with divisive issues. But probably the best-documented cases have to do with how major platforms handle content about nudity and sex. Sex workers have long documented their own shadowbans on mainstream social media platforms, particularly after a pair of bills passed in 2018 aimed at stopping sex trafficking removed protections for online platforms that hosted a wide range of content about sex.  In general, York said, shadowbans become useful moderation tools for platforms when the act of directly restricting certain sorts of content might become a problem for them. “They don’t want to be seen as cutting people off entirely,” she said. “But if they’re getting pressure from different sides, whether it’s governments or shareholders or advertisers, it is probably in their interest to try to curtail certain types of speech while also allowing the people to stay on the platform so it becomes less of a controversy.” TikTok content can also get shadowbanned, according to its community guidelines, which note that the platform “may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the ‘For You’ feed” for violations. Other platforms, like Instagram, YouTube, and X, have used tools to downrank or limit the reach of “borderline” or inappropriate content, as defined by their moderation systems. While it’s very difficult — if not impossible — to prove shadowbanning unless a company decides to confirm that it happened, there are some documented cases of the biases inherent within these moderation systems that, while not quite fitting the definition of shadowbanning, might be worth considering while trying to evaluate claims. TikTok had to correct an error in 2021 that automatically banned creators from using phrases like “black people” or “black success” in their marketing bios for the platform’s database of creators who are available to create sponsored content for brands. In 2017, LGBTQ creators discovered that YouTube had labeled otherwise innocuous videos that happened to feature LGBTQ people in them as “restricted content,” limiting their viewability. This can be difficult! “I do feel like people are often gaslighted by the companies about this,” said York. Many platforms, she continued, “won’t even admit that shadowbanning exists,” even if they use automated moderation tools like keyword filters or account limitations that are capable of creating shadowbans. And some of the telltale signs of shadowbanning — lost followers, a drop in engagement — could be explained by an organic loss of interest in a user’s content or a legitimate software bug. Some platform-specific sites promise to analyze your account and let you know if you’ve been shadowbanned, but those tools are not foolproof. (You should also be careful about giving your account information to a third-party site.) There is one solution, York said: Companies could be more transparent about the content they take down or limit, and explain why. Finding good information about a conflict is already difficult. This is especially true for those trying to learn more about the Israel-Hamas war, and in particular, about Gaza. Few journalists have been able to do on-the-ground reporting from Gaza, making it extremely difficult to verify and contextualize the situation there. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, as of this writing, 29 journalists have died since the war began. Adding the specter of shadowbans to this crisis of reliable information threatens yet another avenue for providing and amplifying firsthand accounts to a wider public.

How does the world feel about Israel/Palestine?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:In one BBC poll of 22 countries, Israel was the fourth-most-disliked nation, behind only Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea.Non-Muslim countries recognize Israel’s legitimacy and maintain diplomatic relations with it, but most are critical of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians and ongoing occupation of the West Bank. Global public opinion at present is generally more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, creating real concern among Israelis that an international boycott movement, called BDS, could pick up some support.Eighty-three percent of the world’s countries, and almost every country that isn’t Arab or Muslim majority, recognizes Israel:That being said, Israel is extremely unpopular worldwide. In one BBC poll of 22 countries, Israel was the fourth-most-disliked nation (behind only Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea).It’s clear that West Bank settlements are a key cause of Israel’s poor global standing. Most of the world believes that Israel’s continued control of the West Bank is an unlawful military occupation, and that settlements violate the Fourth Geneva Convention. Though this view is supported by most legal scholars, Israel and pro-Israel conservatives dispute it. They argue that the West Bank isn’t occupied, and even if it were, the Fourth Geneva convention only prohibits “forcible” population transfers, not voluntary settlement.The BDS movement, which coalesced in 2005, aims to capitalize on international anger with Israel. The movement’s strategy is to create costs to Israel’s Palestinian policy through boycotts of Israeli goods and institutions, divestment from Israeli companies, and sanctions on the nation itself (hence the name BDS).BDS plans to continue boycotting Israel until 1) all of the settlements are dismantled, 2) they believe Palestinians have been given equal rights inside Israel’s borders, and 3) Palestinians refugees are granted the “right of return,” which means to return to the land and homes they used to inhabit in what is now Israel.That last goal has led BDS’s critics to label it a stealth movement to destroy Israel’s existence as a Jewish state. While BDS does not take an official position on Israel’s existence, the size of the Palestinian refugee population means that if it gets what it wants on the right of return, Palestinians could potentially outnumber Israelis, ending Israel’s status as a Jewish state and giving Palestinians the power to dismantle the Israeli state.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a supporter of the two-state solution, opposes BDS. He, as well as a number of liberal Zionists such as the writer Peter Beinart, supports a boycott targeted only at goods made in the West Bank settlements.As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict drags on, many Israelis worry that BDS will become more mainstream. Former Secretary of State John Kerry warned that BDS could end up being a real problem for Israel if it fails to come to terms with the Palestinians.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Hamas has launched an unprecedented strike on Israel. Here’s what you need to know.,2023-10-07,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:The IDF has launched retaliatory strikes after hundreds of Israeli citizens are dead and thousands wounded.Israel has officially declared war against Hamas following an unprecedented assault on Israeli territory by the Gaza-based militant group. The declaration comes after the Biden administration’s promise of additional support for Israel and the announced movement of several US Navy warships and aircraft squadrons into the Eastern Mediterranean. Several countries, including Egypt and Jordan, have volunteered to try to defuse the situation diplomatically.Meanwhile, fighting in southern Israel and Gaza continued on Sunday after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a large, complex, and well-coordinated attack on Israel early Saturday from the territory it controls in Gaza. This comes after months of simmering conflict between Israel and Palestinians in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza. A group of fighters from Hamas’s military arm, the Al-Qassam brigades, entered Israel Saturday — an unprecedented breach of the security apparatus that controls Palestinian movement in and out of Israel — killing at least 700 Israelis, and at least 2,243 were injured, according to the New York Times. At least 413 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2,300 injured, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza reports, both in retaliatory strikes and in gunfights. There have also been reports of Hamas fighters taking hostages back into Gaza, holding Israelis hostage in their homes, and of gunfights in southern Israeli towns. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated on Sunday that his office is working to confirm that Americans are among the missing and dead. Hamas has launched thousands of rockets and mortars into Israeli territory after the initial barrage of at least 2,200 on Saturday morning with additional volleys happening throughout Saturday and Sunday. That number is indicative of the massive scale of this operation; in the whole of a 50-day war between Hamas and Israel in 2014, the group, alongside others, launched a total of 4,564 rockets and mortars into Israel.“Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said about the attacks. “We are in a war and we will win it.” Under Netanyahu’s leadership, Israel has become increasingly hostile to Palestinians and encouraged Israeli settlements in parts of the West Bank, another Palestinian enclave.Meanwhile, discussions about forming an emergency unity government between Netanyahu, Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid, and National Unity party leader Benny Gantz happened, but no clear resolution had been made as of Sunday.The Israeli Defense Forces have already retaliated with airstrikes against Gaza, which has suffered from blockades by Israel and Egypt for years and has been described as an “open-air prison.” Meanwhile, Iran and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shia militant group based in southern Lebanon, have praised the attacks. Saudi Arabia, which is in negotiations to normalize relations with Israel, issued a statement calling for de-escalation, specifically calling out Israel for its “continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.”In Gaza, fears of a ground assault are growing as residents have been warned in a speech by Netanyahu to “leave now” after he threatened to turn Hamas strongholds “into rubble.” Many Palestinian civilians have sought shelter at schools set up by the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees, UNRWA, as Israel hits Gaza with repeated air strikes. Hamas leadership is calling the operation “Al-Aqsa Flood” or “Al-Aqsa Storm” after the mosque in Jerusalem, which is Islam’s third-holiest site. Palestinian worshippers have been repeatedly harassed and attacked by Israeli police and settlers at the site.The attacks came on the final day of Sukkot, a Jewish celebration of the harvest, as well as on the 50th anniversary of the start of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which Egypt and Syria attacked Israel, threatening the existence of the young nation. That, too, was a surprise offensive, and though Israel eventually won the war, victory in that conflict was far from assured.Hamas managed to pull off a stunning assault on several fronts, not only shooting mortars and rockets into Israeli territory but also staging an invasion via air and sea. That infiltration, as many experts have noted, is particularly shocking given Israel’s Mossad intelligence service and the tight control under which Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank live. “The Israelis pride themselves on having world-class intelligence, with the Mossad, with Shin Bet, with Israeli military intelligence,” Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, a global intelligence and security consultancy, told Vox. “They do — from the most exquisite human sources to the most capable technical intelligence gathering capabilities [including] cyber and signals intelligence.” That’s coupled with the basic surveillance that Gazans and other Palestinians live under all the time, like checkpoints to enter and exit Palestinian territory.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]That culture of extreme surveillance made Saturday’s unprecedented infiltration all the more shocking; the fact that Hamas was able to pull off an operation of this size and complexity, not to mention infiltrate Israel and, as has been reported, take hostages, would have been almost unthinkable before Saturday. Yet fighters infiltrated as many as 22 Israeli sites as far as 15 miles away from Gaza’s border with Israel.Though there is speculation about Iranian and Hezbollah involvement in the operation, there are no concrete details about what that entails as of yet. “Iran has played a major role in helping Hamas with its rocket and missile programs, and mortar programs,” Daniel Byman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox. “There’s no question about that, which was a big part of the attack,” he added. Iran and Hezbollah also provide funding, training, and intelligence to Hamas fighters, all of which could have contributed to Saturday’s attack, both Byman and Clarke said. However, given the tensions within Israeli society and the simmering conflict between Israel and Palestine over settlements in the West Bank and traditionally Palestinian sites in East Jerusalem, a conflict of some sort was likely. Israel’s internal politics under Netanyahu have created a maximally polarized society under minority rule by Netanyahu’s Likud party and its right-wing coalition partners, who favor Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory as well as other conservative religious values. A recent decision to change the balance of power between Israel’s Supreme Court and its parliament, the Knesset, sent shockwaves through secular Israeli society, sparking mass protests across several sectors of the country, including Israeli Defense Force reservists. Hamas is likely seeking the return of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, according to experts. In the past, the group has successfully traded a small number of Israeli hostages for Palestinians held in Israel, notably keeping Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit for five years before exchanging him for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, the New York Times reported. The number of hostages is as yet unknown, but they are reportedly being held both within Gaza itself and in Israeli villages where Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters have been able to infiltrate. The hostages include a “substantial” number of both civilians and IDF soldiers, the Israeli military confirmed Saturday. Saturday’s attack, though it’s unprecedented in scale, complexity, and surprise factor is all happening in the context of increased settlements in the West Bank, a brutal, 16-year blockade on Gaza by Israel and Egypt, the political vacuum in the Palestinian territories, the displacement of generations of Palestinians since the founding of the Israeli state, and the apartheid under which Palestinians live.Most Gazans are either refugees from the 1948 Nakba, when mass numbers of Palestinians were displaced during the Arab-Israeli War, or descendants of those refugees, said Zaha Hassan, a human rights lawyer and fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. They’ve lived under a strict blockade by Israel and Egypt, relying on foreign aid to access basic necessities, and about one-third of Gazans live in extreme poverty according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. There is also little mobile connectivity, Hassan said, making communication with the outside world difficult. Diana Buttu, a Haifa-based analyst and former legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization and Palestinian negotiators, told Vox in an interview that many Palestinians were jubilant at the start of the attacks. “When you punch your abuser in the face, it feels good,” she said. “The first reaction was elation — we saw that both in Gaza and in the West Bank. In Ramallah [in the West Bank] people were over-the-top happy because it was not just a punch in the face,” but also because Hamas was able to breach the security state that defines and diminishes so many Palestinians’ lives.Palestinians have also lived without real political representation or power for decades, both within Israel and within the Palestinian territories. Though Hamas nominally controls Gaza and the Palestinian Authority the West Bank, these parties have been unable to negotiate a solution to the crisis or to uphold democracy within the Palestinian territory. Mahmoud Abbas, president of the PA, has been in office since 2005, and neither Gaza nor the West Bank has held elections since 2006 when Hamas and Fatah, Abbas’s party, failed to make a coalition government for the West Bank and Gaza. With Israel normalizing relationships with Arab nations — including, potentially, Saudi Arabia — and the US unlikely to take an active role in negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leadership, some Palestinians feel they have no other choice, Hassan said. “The message has been clear to Palestinians,” Hassan said. “They can’t wait on some Arab savior and they can’t wait on the US government to act as peace broker — that they’re going to have to take matters into their own hands, whatever that looks like.”If the past is any indication, Israel’s response will be intended to be deterrent, not proportional — and Palestinian casualties will be heavy.“All means are relevant, all means are legitimate against this barbaric and horrific attack toward innocent civilians — women, children. This is a barbaric organization and it is going to pay an extremely heavy price for its crimes,” Amichai Chikli, Israeli minister of diaspora affairs, said on the BBC’s Newshour program on Saturday. Israeli airstrikes have already completely flattened several residential buildings in Gaza as well as a building that held Hamas offices. Previous conflicts between Hamas and Israel have caused disproportionate devastation for Palestinians, including decimation of their infrastructure and civilian deaths from airstrikes.Because Israel was caught so off guard, it is likely to hit back hard. “Deterrence is about disproportionality,” Byman said. “Hamas has to take a lot more to be deterred.”“Netanyahu in the past has tried to avoid significant ground operations in Gaza, because he knows it will be messy — really messy,” Byman said. The presence of Israeli citizens in Gaza complicates any retaliation effort, though, due to the sensitivity of that issue in Israeli consciousness. “The question is, will the political dynamic push him to that, even if it might be self-defeating for Israel in the long term?”Correction, October 7, 3:15 pm ET: A previous version of this story misstated that the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the second-holiest site in Islam.

What is Gaza?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:It’s a strip of land surrounded by Israel but populated by Palestinians.Editor’s note, November 9, 2023: This story has been updated to reflect details of the current Israel-Hamas war. For all of Vox’s latest coverage on Israel and Palestine, see our storystream.Gaza is a densely populated strip of land that is mostly surrounded by Israel and peopled almost exclusively by Palestinians. Israel’s military occupied it from 1967 to 2005, when it unilaterally withdrew. It’s currently under Israeli blockade, and Israel is at war with Hamas, the militant group that governs the region, as of early October.Egypt controlled Gaza until the Six-Day War in 1967, after which Israel occupied it (along with the West Bank). Until 2005, Israeli military authorities controlled Gaza in the same way they control the West Bank, and Jews were permitted to settle there. In 2005, then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon pulled out Israeli troops and settlers unilaterally.Gaza is governed by the Islamist group Hamas, which was initially an Egyptian group, the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza. In 1987 it became Hamas, a militant “resistance” group against Israel, and won political power in a 2006 election. Hamas’s takeover of Gaza following a conflict with backers of the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, prompted an Israeli blockade of the flow of commercial goods into Gaza, on the grounds that Hamas could use those goods to make weapons to be used against Israel. Egypt, which borders Gaza on the south, supports that blockade in part due to the connection with the Muslim Brotherhood. Israel has eased the blockade at certain points over time, but the cutoff of basic supplies like fuel still does significant humanitarian harm by cutting off access to electricity, food, and medicine.Hamas and other Gaza-based militants have fired thousands of rockets from the territory at Israeli targets. Israel has launched a number of military operations in Gaza, including an air campaign and ground invasion in late 2008 and early 2009, a major bombing campaign in 2012, and another air and ground assault in the summer of 2014. The periodic, escalating cycles of violence between Hamas and Israel since the latter’s withdrawal has strengthened Israeli hawks’ political position, as they have long argued that any Palestinian state would end up serving as a launching pad for attacks on Israel.In 2023, after Hamas and the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched a coordinated land, sea, and air attack against Israel on October 7, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government declared war on Hamas. That included what Israel called a “complete siege” — cutting off access to electricity, food, fuel, water, and medicine — and began with a massive air assault on Gaza before a ground incursion into the territory.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The Biden’s administration’s remarkably unambitious approach to Israel,2023-07-11,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:What we learned from Ambassador Tom Nides’s exit interview with the Wall Street Journal.The Wall Street Journal on Monday published an exit interview with President Joe Biden’s outgoing ambassador to Israel, Tom Nides, in which he called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to slow the extremist Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan and trumpeted efforts to improve conditions in the occupied Palestinian territories. Nides said that the US role in Israel remains indispensable. “I think most Israelis want the United States to be in their business,” he told the Journal.But, with the ambassador’s planned departure coming just after the Israeli military’s siege of the West Bank city of Jenin, the comments revealed something more candid about the Biden administration’s emphasis there. The focus: relatively minor economic development initiatives for Palestinians without a bigger plan, or even a stronger stance on how to protect Palestinian rights.“No, I’m not getting a Nobel Peace Prize in the next seven days,” Nides said in the interview. “But I do think I can look back and say that I’ve done things that have made life just a little bit easier and better for the average Palestinian.” His only mention of Jenin appeared to be about a power plant he had worked on getting for the city.The interview shows how unambitious Biden’s approach is to a conflict that previous US administrations have invested significant diplomatic capital in resolving. Nides, who is active on social media and has a big personality in media encounters, offers a remarkable snapshot of how the Biden administration sees Israel and Palestine. As he put it, “I think the important thing for the security state of Israel is to keep things calm in the West Bank.”Absent a political horizon for Palestinians, what Nides and the Biden administration envision is not possible. The US would need to articulate the consequences that its close partner Israel would face for the ongoing occupation, or else there will be more sieges of cities like Jenin, there will be more wars between Gaza and Israel, and the underlying issues of the Israel-Palestine conflict will be left unaddressed.Israel’s military occupation has continued since 1967, and the longstanding US policy of achieving an independent Palestinian state has been in formaldehyde since the Obama years. “I did not come here to negotiate a two-state solution. I came here to do practical things,” Nides told the Journal.So far in the Biden presidency, competition with China has been the primary focus. And since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe has sucked away much of US diplomatic attention. It means that US leadership in the Middle East has diminished.Still, Biden’s inner circle has taken the time in recent months to lay out what it sees as the pillars of its Middle East policy. The White House’s Middle East coordinator, Brett McGurk, has described it as “back to basics.” It doesn’t involve a Middle East peace plan, in a departure from previous administrations. The major tenets are working with Israel to counter Iran, gently urging Israel to rein in the most extreme members of Netanyahu’s government, and offering Palestinians so-called economic peace through development aid. The administration has also touted a new regional meeting platform called the Negev Forum that brings together Israel and the Arab states it has normalized relations with, including Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates. Though Biden officials have described values as essential to US foreign policy, they have not articulated the role of human rights in the US approach to Israel and Palestine.When Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the Council on Foreign Relations in late June, he described the situation glibly. “We’ve told our friends and allies in Israel that if there’s a fire burning in their backyard, it’s going to be a lot tougher, if not impossible, to actually both deepen the existing agreements [with Arab states] as well as to expand them to include potentially Saudi Arabia,” Blinken said. The idea of Palestine just being Israel’s backyard tacitly suggested that the US in essence sees the occupied territory as part of Israel — and it certainly did not indicate any action beyond the maintenance of the status quo.At the same time, White House officials have cheered a small maritime agreement between Israel and Lebanon, two countries that do not have diplomatic relations. This is a minuscule accomplishment considering the stakes of the region. It also shows how the Biden administration has focused on small practicalities, rather than using the tens of billions of dollars and security guarantees it has given Israel as leverage to make significant steps toward policies that acknowledge the reality of the ongoing occupation.In his interview with the Journal, Nides emphasized the promise of economic peace.Under Biden, the US has pushed for “extending the opening hours of the vital Allenby Bridge Crossing between the West Bank and Jordan; 4G phone service for West Bank Palestinians; $100 million in promised aid for health services for Palestinians; getting Israeli approval for Palestinians to develop a small gas field off the Gaza Strip; and working on getting a new power plant for the West Bank city of Jenin working,” according to the Journal.  Those are positive developments; economic officers in the embassy deserve credit for them. But they are small accomplishments for an ambassador.To bring about a comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians without addressing the fundamental issues regarding disenfranchisement and political rights in occupied Palestine is just “recycling old ideas,” as analysts Zaha Hassan and Daniel Levy recently noted. (Disclosure: I worked alongside Levy at think tanks from 2009 to 2012.) Levy and Hassan argue that Biden’s team has pushed for economic peace at a particularly incongruous time, in which leading human rights groups in Palestine, Israel, and internationally have documented how Israeli policies constitute apartheid. A growing global movement is calling out Israel as an apartheid state. For Palestinians, economic initiatives are wholly insufficient in changing the political anguish. “If your counterpoint to the strengthening ‘end apartheid’ frame is getting Palestinians 4G, guess who’s gonna win that over time?” Levy, the executive director of the US/Middle East Project, told me.Levy is concerned about how weak the Biden administration’s ambition is. The economic peace argument will not resonate with a new generation of Palestinians in the West Bank, lacking in political opportunity.  All the while, the Middle East is resolving its own issues, which is not necessarily bad given the US track record of hugging Israel and launching endless military interventions, while also moving closer to China. Indeed, Beijing brokered the most significant diplomatic deal in the Middle East since Biden took office, bringing together adversaries Saudi Arabia and Iran. “The region is moving on, and it’s trying to sort out more of its affairs,” Levy explains. But the US remains trapped in an old bubble of its making on Israel-Palestine.Supporters of the Biden administration’s approach say that the big things aren’t possible now, so the effort needs to be on the economic as well as Israel’s integration into the Arab Middle East. “Give Biden credit,” Daniel Shapiro, who served as Obama’s ambassador to Israel, wrote of Biden’s regional trip last summer. “With the crushing crises he faced upon taking office, the Middle East was never going to be a top priority.”Shapiro told Congress in March that pushing more Arab states to normalize relations with Israel is the “one potential source of positive energy in the Israeli-Palestinian arena.” Now, he will join the State Department to work in a new role focused on Israel’s integration into the Arab world.

Did the Scream franchise just fall apart?,2023-11-28,Vox,['Alex Abad-Santos'],"Filed under:Melissa Barrera was fired from Scream 7 over her support of Palestine. Then Jenna Ortega left too. The revamped and ultra-successful Scream franchise may be dead. Over the long Thanksgiving weekend, actresses Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega reportedly left Scream 7 — one fired and one on her own accord. Spyglass, the studio that produces Scream, fired Barrera for what it says were antisemitic posts. Barrera had been posting support for Palestine and criticism against the Israeli government’s retaliatory violence in the wake of Hamas’s terrorist attacks last month. Shortly after Barrera’s firing, it was announced that Ortega would be leaving the project too.Barrera and Ortega’s exits are a big deal for the franchise. The two have been a crucial part of Scream’s resurgence and cultural resonance. They made the horror series an astounding success and relevant again. In an industry dominated by IP and franchises, studios don’t just let its successful stars leave. Hence, Barrera and Ortega’s departures raise a lot of questions: Why did Spyglass fire Barrera? What exactly was she posting, and was it as bad as Spyglass has made it out to be? Furthermore, did Ortega leave willingly as a sign of support for Barrera? What does this mean for their careers? And is there even a Scream franchise left?News of Barrera’s firing was confirmed last week on November 21. Prior to her firing, Barrera was posting support for Palestinian people and was criticizing the Israeli government’s attacks on the region, focusing specifically on the government’s responsibility for the bombings and deaths of Palestinian civilians. She wrote on Instagram stories (temporary posts) on October 22: I have been actively looking for videos and information about the Palestinian side for the last 2 weeks or so, following accounts etc. Why? Because western media only shows the other side. Why they do that, I will let you deduce for yourself. Usually, the algorithm on social media gets the gist. Well... my discover page on IG will only show me videos showing and talking about the Israeli side. Censorship is very real.Variety, which confirmed and broke the news of Barrera’s firing, initially reported that this post led to Barrera’s termination. The outlet stated that their sources believed Barrera’s questioning of the media coverage “floated an antisemitic trope that Jews control the media.” Later that day, a spokesperson at Spyglass Media told Variety that Barrera was dismissed for referring to Israel’s attacks on Palestine as “genocide”: We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.The Spyglass statement about “false references to genocide [and] ethnic cleansing” seemed to cite an Instagram post in which Barrera shared an article from Jewish Currents magazine written by scholar Raz Segal. Jewish Currents is a left-leaning magazine, and Segal’s article was headlined “A Textbook Case of Genocide.” Segal, an Israeli historian, is the director of the master’s degree program in Holocaust and genocide studies at Stockton University.As Barrera’s fans and critics of Spyglass’s decision pointed out profusely, criticizing media coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict isn’t inherently antisemitic. Equating criticism automatically with antisemitism, and cracking down on dissent, is a worrying precedent that can result in political repression. And as my colleague A.W. Ohlheiser pointed out, harmful misinformation runs rampant on social media and there are hardly any guardrails, especially on sites like X (formerly known as Twitter). And as the Washington Post reported, news organizations have come under fire and are still figuring out precise language to use in reporting on violence in the region. Earlier this month, Jazmine Hughes, an award-winning writer for the New York Times Magazine, resigned from the company after signing an open letter from US-based reporters that asked “Western newsroom leaders to be clear-eyed in coverage of Israel’s repeated atrocities against Palestinians.”Labeling Barrera as antisemitic is a serious charge, as is stating that she was spreading the harmful trope of “Jewish people controlling the media.” While Barrera’s posts do question the media coverage and what images of the conflict have surfaced on social media, it takes a leap to call them blatantly antisemitic and evidence of hate speech.In the hours following the news of her firing, Barrera posted a statement on Instagram: “First and foremost I condemn antisemitism and Islamophobia. I condemn hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people,” she wrote. “I pray day and night for no more deaths, for no more violence, and for peaceful co-existence. I will continue to speak out for those that need it most and continue to advocate for peace and safety, for human rights and freedom. Silence is not an option for me,” she added.Prior to her firing, Barrera had around a million Instagram followers. Today she has over 1.5 million. Barrera is continuing to post support for Palestinian people and denounce the Israeli government’s violence in the region.Shortly after Barrera’s firing, trade publications reported that Jenna Ortega would not be returning to the franchise either. Some were extremely adamant (perhaps due to the optics and way in which Barrera was assertively fired) that Ortega’s departure had nothing to do with Barrera’s dismissal and everything to do with filming a second season of Wednesday, a Netflix project that Ortega has criticized in the past despite being its lead star. Eagle-eyed fans pointed out that Ortega liked an pro-Palestine Instagram post on November 22 praising Barrera for standing her ground against Spyglass. Ortega’s commitment to Wednesday is the closest to an official reason for her departure, although there still has not been a confirmation of exactly why Ortega left Scream.With both Barrera and Ortega out, Spyglass has effectively lost the core of its rebooted Scream franchise, as the two stars have been integral to both its plot and success.Storywise, Barrera and Ortega play two sisters — Sam and Tara Carpenter — who are connected to the original Woodsboro murders. Sam is the daughter of Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), the killer in the first Scream. Both Scream 5 and Scream 6 are about Sam’s realization about who her father is, her fears of inheriting his violent tendencies, and how her connection to him externally affects her relationship with Tara and their group of friends (Chad and Mindy Meeks-Martin, played by Mason Gooding and Jasmin Savoy Brown).Scream 6, especially, was about how this group, a “core four,” would now carry on the Scream franchise as original characters Dewey Riley (David Arquette), Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) were either killed off or given endings. Campbell, who has been the series’ main star for the first five movies, did not return for Scream 6 because of a salary dispute.  Without Barrera and Ortega, the current Scream story is effectively dead. Barrera and Ortega have also been a part of the franchise’s box office success. The reason that there’s a Scream 7 at all is because of how well Scream 5 and 6 did. Scream 6, released earlier this year, became the highest-grossing movie in the series domestically. It made over $108 million in its North American theatrical release, and around $168 million worldwide. Ortega in particular has carved out a niche as a Gen-Z scream queen after appearing in horror and horror-adjacent projects like You, The Babysitter: Killer Queen, X, Scream, and Wednesday.Letting these two crucial stars go is a precarious move for the franchise, especially when you consider the movie industry these days is so bent on mining IP and sustaining a successful franchise. Spyglass found that rare winning formula, and now will have to start from scratch. It’s also worth noting that the majority of Americans support a ceasefire in Gaza — a point that Barrera has been advocating for as well. Furthermore, Gen Z and millennials, like Barrera and the audiences Spyglass is courting with this new franchise, have shown more support for Palestine. In an attempt to salvage Scream 7, Spyglass is reportedly reaching out to Neve Campbell to bring back the series’s original heroine, Sidney Prescott. Given the criticism that Spyglass is receiving and positive feedback that Barrera and Ortega have gotten, it’s hard to see Campbell or any big star signing on in the wake of both Barrera and Ortega’s departures. And without Barrera and Ortega returning, it’s not a given that Scream’s audience would return either.

Trump’s top Middle East peace envoy is quitting. There’s still no Israel-Palestine deal.,2019-09-05,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:“Trump picked loyalists who knew little about the conflict to help resolve one of the most intractable conflicts in the world,” an expert said.Jason Greenblatt, President Donald Trump’s special envoy for Middle East peace, is stepping down from his post — throwing even more doubt on whether the “deal of the century” between Israel and the Palestinians that Trump has been teasing for months will actually work.Multiple news outlets reported Thursday that Greenblatt, whose previous job was as a real estate lawyer for the Trump Organization, planned to step down later this month after releasing a draft of the long-awaited “political” portion of the Middle East peace plan following Israel’s upcoming elections. Trump confirmed the reports of Greenblatt’s departure shortly after in a pair of tweets in which he called the Middle East envoy “a loyal and great friend” whose “dedication to Israel and to seeking peace between Israel and the Palestinians won’t be forgotten.”In a statement released by the White House, Greenblatt said he was “grateful to have been part of the team that drafted a realistic vision for peace, which has the potential to improve the lives of millions of Israelis, Palestinians and others in the region.”But what that “realistic vision for peace” looks like — or whether the White House will actually release it in full within any of our lifetimes — has been an open question since the administration took power. Greenblatt has spent nearly three years working on it with senior White House adviser Jared Kushner and a few others in the administration, and we’ve yet to see the full fruits of their labor.Now, with Greenblatt’s sudden departure, the prospects for a comprehensive peace plan seem even dimmer.  But Greenblatt’s effort was always an uphill battle. He came into the role with no foreign policy experience beyond holding staunch pro-Israel positions, and he was tasked with helping negotiate one of the world’s thorniest foreign policy challenges that successive US administrations have failed to solve.Avi Berkowitz, a 30-year-old friend and adviser of Kushner’s who graduated from Harvard Law School in 2016, will take Greenblatt’s place (the State Department’s top Iran official, Brian Hook, will also pitch in). Martin Indyk, who led peace deal efforts in the Obama administration, blasted the idea of Berkowitz taking the portfolio, calling it “a considerable downgrade in the position” in a tweet Thursday.Other experts I spoke to, though, were less concerned about the staffing change. “Greenblatt’s departure isn’t likely to have any real impact since the plan he and the administration were working on was always going nowhere,” Khaled Elgindy, an adviser to Palestinian leadership from 2004 to 2009, told me. “It matters even less who his replacement will be.”Back in June, Kushner unveiled the first economics-focused part of the peace plan at a conference in Bahrain. Dubbed “Peace to Prosperity,” the plan was billed as “a vision to empower the Palestinian people to build a prosperous and vibrant Palestinian society.” The administration claimed it had “the potential to facilitate more than $50 billion in new investment over ten years.”But critics slammed the proposal, likening it to a “real estate brochure” — complete with glossy promotional photos from Palestinian aid programs that the Trump administration has cut funding for. Zero Palestinian or Israeli officials attend the conference in Bahrain when it was rolled out.Crucially, the plan lacked any details about a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That was by design: Kushner decided to put out the economic half of the plan first before releasing the political half sometime later this year, saying that releasing the economic piece was “less controversial.” But without that second political half, the economic proposal was essentially meaningless.Yet it’s unlikely that the political portion of the peace plan, which Greenblatt spearheaded, would be any more impressive or feasible. He, Kushner, and the Trump administration in general are strongly disliked by Palestinian leaders, who (understandably) see the administration as unfairly biased in favor of Israel. Indeed, since Trump announced the relocation of the US Embassy to Jerusalem in 2017, Palestinian officials have openly  boycotted all talks with the administration.And many experts point to Trump’s decision to appoint uninformed dilettantes like Kushner and Greenblatt to the high-level negotiating roles as one of the core failings of the administration’s efforts.“Trump’s Mideast peace team was set up for failure because it lacked experienced diplomats with knowledge about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Guy Ziv, an Israel expert at American University in Washington, DC, told me. “Instead, Trump picked loyalists who knew little about the conflict to help resolve one of the most intractable conflicts in the world,” Ziv said, adding that the team’s makeup “undermined America’s traditional role as an honest broker, losing all credibility with the Palestinians.” Although Trump says Greenblatt is merely “leaving to pursue work in the private sector,” Ziv notes that “[t]he timing of Greenblatt’s resignation, just weeks before the ‘deal of the century’ was to be unveiled, certainly makes it clear that Greenblatt had no faith that the administration’s peace plan would get anywhere.” With Greenblatt at the helm, the chances of striking a deal were already close to zero. But with him gone — and someone even less experienced taking over — the likelihood somehow drops even lower.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."

What will Palestinians do now?,2020-01-29,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:An expert explains Palestinian leaders’ options after Trump revealed his peace plan.It took almost no time for Palestinian leaders to reject President Donald Trump’s Israel-Palestine peace plan.“After the nonsense that we heard today we say a thousand no’s to the ‘deal of the century,’”  said Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, at a news conference shortly after the proposal’s unveiling Tuesday. “We are certain that our Palestinian people will not let these conspiracies pass. So, all options are open.”What those options are, though, remains an important question. It’s still unclear just what Palestinian leaders plan to do going forward, especially if they continue to refuse to negotiate with the Trump administration.Will Abbas try to gain international support for his views instead of Trump’s, or will he simply try to wait out the American president’s time in office? What of the terrorist group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, and therefore plays an important role in defining next steps? And how about the millions of Palestinians directly affected by the US and Israeli-backed plan? Will they choose to demonstrate peacefully, violently, or not at all?To get a better sense of what might happen, I called Ghaith al-Omari, who’s a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank. A former adviser to Abbas and the Palestinian negotiating team during the peace process, he has a deep insight into what leaders in the West Bank and Gaza are thinking right now.The one thing he’s sure about? Trump’s plan strengthened hardliners and weakened those who might still want to chart a diplomatic path. “It devalues the Palestinian Authority’s paradigm of diplomacy and negotiation and will reinforce the Hamas paradigm of violence and terror,” he told me.Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.How will Palestinians respond to the peace plan?They’ve already rejected the plan. They also called for an Arab League meeting on Saturday with the idea of getting support from Arab countries. I have to say that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s immediate push for annexation of parts of the West Bank and the clear inclinations of the Trump administration will make the Palestinians’ job much easier. No Arab country can accept unilateral annexation.Should we assume that the peace plan is dead on arrival, then?In diplomatic terms, it’s dead. Once the Palestinians and the Arab states take a clear position, then the Europeans will follow suit, and the Russians would come on board, and in the end we’re likely going to end up with a plan that is only truly supported by the US and Israel, and maybe some marginal countries. Now, what does the plan mean for changes on the ground? That’s really up to the Israelis. Are they going to go for extensive annexation? Would this lead to a collapse of the Palestinian Authority, et cetera? We have to wait and see.As you alluded to, Netanyahu has said his cabinet will vote on annexing 30 percent of the West Bank. What do you make of that news?The timing is precious. Annexing any parts of the West Bank or any parts of the Jordan Valley will create a very strong Arab reaction. Not only Palestinian, but also Jordanian, because Jordan has said annexation would have dire consequences in terms of the relations with Israel. A situation like that would certainly make it impossible for the United States to build any international support for the plan.What should Palestinian leaders do if diplomacy is dead?The Palestinians are playing the long game. Their concern is that the Trump plan becomes their new terms of reference. The way that they would counter that is by creating wall-to-wall international consensus against this plan. They would go to the Arab League and get a resolution. They would go to the European Union and try to get a resolution. If that doesn’t work, they will get support for their side through bilateral agreements with key states, and then they’ll go to the UN Security Council. They would surely garner an American veto there on a resolution, but that’s fine for them as long as they get the other 14 countries on the panel to sign on to it.So we’re going to see a very intensive diplomatic effort to create an international consensus that they hope will outlive Trump. On the ground, if there is an annexation, then the Palestinians will find it very hard to continue their security cooperation with Israel. And if that ends, then the possibilities for deterioration and instability become extremely worrying. To be clear, what would going to the UN or the EU really do? Why are those important steps for Palestinians to take at this point?Because from the Palestinian point of view, they think that they can wait out Trump heading into the US presidential election in November. They want to be in a position where they have a new US administration and the international consensus remains within the old parameters. Then they’ll hope that the new administration will revert back to the traditional US position. Not all Palestinian leaders agree diplomacy is the right course of action. One could argue the Trump administration’s plan is a gift to hardliners who want to pursue a new course. How do you expect the intra-Palestinian struggle to play out?It’s playing out as we speak. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas convened a meeting, and Hamas and the Islamic Jihad were at the meeting. These two actors will continue pushing for more violence. Ironically, they will push for it in the West Bank, but not where they govern, in Gaza. The main line that they will advocate is to cut security cooperation with the Israelis because security cooperation has really limited Hamas’s ability to operate in the West Bank. But they will go back to what they always do, which is engage in terror, engage in destabilization. They are trying to corner Abbas, and part of that is dictating the agenda with terror. They feel politically very empowered and Abbas really is in a very difficult place to reject their inclusion. This crisis will not lead to unity. But this will lead, I think, to Hamas being empowered in the West Bank.So you’re saying the Trump administration’s peace plan proposal might give Hamas a bit more power within Palestinian leadership?Absolutely. It devalues the Palestinian Authority’s paradigm of diplomacy and negotiation and will reinforce the Hamas paradigm of violence and terror.There was a lot of worry that if the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem, there’d be a lot of violence. There was some, but it didn’t become a big thing. What should we expect the popular reaction to be to this plan?That’s the biggest unknown. The lack of violence after the Jerusalem embassy move was partly because the public was tired and partly because the Palestinian security forces were coordinating with the Israelis to keep demonstrations away from friction points. Today, it’s clear the Palestinian public is checked out. But if history is any guide, this can very quickly turn into a crisis.We have volatility, but simply no way of predicting how the public is going to react. Keep in mind that the Palestinian public is not only fed up with the Israeli diplomacy, but also with their own leadership. So would they respond to Hamas’s calls for violence or not? This is truly an ongoing concern, and I think this is what’s keeping the Israeli and Palestinian security folks awake at night.Surely some will worry that a declining change of diplomacy means the possibility of a major conflict — or at least a bigger conflict — grows. Do you think that fear is justified?Yes, I think that fear is justified. Again, I wouldn’t go for doom and gloom because we have no certainty, but I think it increases the likelihood and increases the volatility of the situation.What needs to happen for this situation to improve, then?In the short term, I believe the priority is to ensure that things don’t devolve into a security problem. Here, the Arab countries can play an important role in convincing Abbas to maintain security control. In the longer term, I think the real battle is whether the Trump administration manages to turn this into the new international terms of reference, in which case the Palestinians will only become weaker. If that happens, Palestinians might manage to isolate themselves from the American and Israeli positions.So far, though, I have to say that the Trump administration’s diplomatic performance has been extremely lackluster. So for the Palestinians, the way they see it is: Wait out this administration and see what comes next.

Why Israel imprisons so many Palestinians,2023-11-22,Vox,['Abdallah Fayyad'],"Filed under:150 Palestinian prisoners are being released as part of Israel and Hamas’s recent hostage deal. But thousands more remain behind bars.On October 12, in the West Bank village of Wadi al-Seeq, Israeli soldiers and settlers detained three Palestinians and spent hours abusing them. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the Israelis stripped the detainees down to their underwear, blindfolded and photographed them, beat them with knives and an iron pipe, put out cigarettes on their bodies, and even urinated on them. One of the detainees described the experience as “Abu Ghraib with the [Israeli] army.” The Israeli military said that it is investigating the incident, but that horrifying account did not occur in a vacuum. Since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, Palestinians in the West Bank have been victimized by a surge in violence perpetrated by both Israeli soldiers and settlers. One of the major sources of that escalation is a tool of repression that Israel has long deployed against Palestinians and has used even more aggressively in recent weeks: administrative detention, a practice that allows Israel to jail Palestinians indefinitely without charge or trial. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]The three Palestinians who were abused in Wadi al-Seeq were released on the same day they were detained and subsequently sent to the hospital. But many of Israel’s detainees get locked up for months, or even years, without ever being charged with a crime. And while Israel argues that this is a lawful preventative security measure — allowing it to target people for a range of political activity, including speech and nonviolent protest — human rights groups have deemed Israel’s use of administrative detention a blatant violation of international law.Even beyond administrative detention, when charges are brought against Palestinians in the West Bank, they are almost always tried in military courts that have a near-perfect conviction rate. (By contrast, Israelis are usually tried in civil court.) Palestinians, in other words, are sent to a trapdoor instead of a fair trial. The result is that today, thousands of Palestinians, including hundreds of children, are held in Israeli custody on murky legal grounds — a problem that’s only gotten worse in recent years. Some human rights organizations have called out Israel’s military-imposed legal system in the West Bank as evidence that Israel is committing the crime of persecution, intentionally depriving Palestinians of their fundamental rights because of their ethnic identity. That’s why, even well before this war, the release of these prisoners has been a key Palestinian demand in negotiations with Israel. And just this week, Israel agreed to a deal where Hamas will return 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners and a brief pause in Israel’s bombardment in Gaza. Before October 7, the number of Palestinians held by Israel under administrative detention was already at a 20-year high. According to the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem, there were 1,310 Palestinians imprisoned without charge or trial at the end of September, including at least 146 minors. Since then, Israel has dramatically increased its use of administrative detention, pushing the number of detainees to over 2,000 within the first four weeks of the war. (That’s out of a total of roughly 7,000 Palestinian prisoners.)“While this is not completely prohibited under international law, the use of administrative detention is only permitted in exceptional circumstances and subject to stringent safeguards,” Elizabeth Rghebi, the Middle East and North Africa advocacy director at Amnesty International USA, told me. Israel contends that it has the right to circumvent certain international obligations in the West Bank, saying that it’s not part of Israel’s sovereign territory and therefore subject to military laws that can restrict people’s civil rights. But watchdog groups, including the United Nations Human Rights Committee, argue that as the occupying power, Israel must respect human rights in Palestinian territories — especially as the occupation grows older and more entrenched.And before the war, Israel was not, by and large, deploying this tool lawfully. “Amnesty has found that Israel’s systematic use of administrative detention against Palestinians indicates that it’s used to persecute Palestinians rather than as an extraordinary and selectively used preventative measure,” Rghebi said. Israel maintains that it detains people because of legitimate security concerns, such as potential participation in violent attacks. But while there is a thin veneer of due process — Palestinians can appeal their detention orders, for example — the reality is that a stunningly low number of appeals succeed, in no small part because as both local and international human rights groups have documented, neither the detainees nor their lawyers are told what evidence Israel has against them. (According to B’Tselem, Israeli military courts only nullified 1.2 percent of detention orders issued between 2015 and 2017, and an investigation by Haaretz found that as of August, not a single detention order had been canceled this year.)“Evidence has shown that [administrative detention] is a pretext to persecute and deprive people of their fundamental rights and freedoms because they challenge the Israeli military occupation,” Rghebi said. In 2022, Amnesty International released a comprehensive report pointing to the practice of administrative detention as just one example of how the Israeli state subjugates Palestinians and cracks down on dissent. Since 1967, Israel has issued over 1,000 military orders that criminalize a range of activities in Palestinians’ daily lives, including waving political symbols like flags, being in certain areas without permits, and any kind of speech that can fit into a loosely defined charge of “incitement.” Citing decades of evidence, the Amnesty report outlined an “intentional Israeli policy to detain individuals, including prisoners of conscience, solely for the non-violent exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association, and punish them for their views.”Indeed, over the years, Israel has detained hundreds of people, including dozens of journalists, for security concerns that amounted to nothing more than social media posts. And since October 7, Israeli forces have been aggressively policing what Palestinians are saying online. Tala Naser, a lawyer at the Palestinian prisoner and human rights organization Addameer, told me that even social media posts that merely include Palestinian flags or quotes from the Quran are being targeted by Israel as sources of incitement. Not all Palestinian prisoners are held under administrative detention. In fact, before the latest war started, there were roughly 5,000 Palestinians held in Israeli custody, and about 1,300 of them were under administrative detention. Thousands of others are serving sentences because unlike administrative detainees, they actually were charged with a crime and convicted.On the surface, those convictions might make those cases of imprisonment seem more legitimate. But dig a little deeper and you find a legal system that’s riddled with unjust practices that all but guarantee a guilty verdict. According to the Israeli government’s own data, a whopping 99.7 percent of cases that went through Israeli military courts in 2010 ended in a conviction. “There’s no fair trial guarantees in these courts,” Naser, the prisoner rights attorney, said. Palestinians are routinely denied counsel, for example, and faced with language barriers and mistranslations that taint testimonies and confessions used in court. But it’s not only a lack of due process that plagues this legal system. Oftentimes, these cases are based on specious and far-reaching charges. Take, for example, the case of Nariman Tamimi, who was targeted because of a Facebook livestream. Military prosecutors indicted her in 2018 on account of trying to influence public opinion “in a manner that may harm public order and safety,” as well as allegedly calling for violence. But Human Rights Watch, which reviewed the case and evidence in question, said that “nowhere in the video or case file does Nariman call for violence.” Still, Tamimi pleaded guilty and told Human Rights Watch that she did so in order to avoid a longer prison sentence. (Tamimi’s daughter, Ahed Tamimi, who was put under administrative detention when she was 16 years old, was again detained earlier this month for “inciting terrorism.”) Systematically denying people their right to a fair trial is a violation of international law, and Tamimi’s experience mirrors countless others, including children who receive the same treatment as adults. Israel, after all, is the only country that routinely puts children on trial in military courts, and it even established the “first and only juvenile military court in operation in the world,” according to a report by the United Nations.All of this points to sham trials being a feature of Israel’s military court system, not a bug.Israel has a long history of torturing Palestinian prisoners. In 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court reviewed various methods of torture used by Israeli agencies and issued a ruling outlawing them. An Israeli government report released the following year not only admitted to the systematic use of torture against Palestinians during the First Intifada but also found that law-enforcement agencies had lied to cover it up.Yet more than two decades later, Palestinian detainees and prisoners still report being subject to torture and other types of humiliating and inhumane treatment, as in the case of the three Palestinians detained in Wadi al-Seeq last month. And despite its 1999 ruling, the Israeli Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed for torture to continue under certain circumstances. Since October 7, there has been a spike in reports of abuse and ill-treatment of Palestinian detainees and prisoners. Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Authority Commission for Prisoners’ Affairs, told Reuters that at least four Palestinians have died while being held in Israeli custody, adding that their autopsies revealed evidence of torture and medical neglect. These harsh conditions were widespread before the war, and even children held in detention have been subject to ill-treatment, physical abuse, solitary confinement, and more. Such practices not only point to more evidence of the unlawful nature of Israel’s detention policies but also give more weight to the growing calls on Israel to release Palestinian prisoners.After Hamas’s October 7 attack, in which roughly 1,200 Israelis were killed, the world’s attention turned to the over 200 Israeli hostages who were captured that day and how they could be safely returned to their families. But as Israel geared up for its subsequent military assault on Gaza, the fates of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners illegally detained by Israel were notably missing from many conversations about how Israel could secure the hostages’ release — a critical omission because those prisoners, which include hundreds of children, are key to at least one potential diplomatic resolution: a prisoner swap. As the recent deal between Israel and Hamas shows, this was neither a fringe idea nor an unrealistic proposal. In fact, Israel has engaged in these kinds of exchanges many times before, and thousands of Palestinian prisoners have been released as a result of such deals over the years. In 2011, for example, 1,027 Palestinians were let out of prison in exchange for one Israeli soldier held hostage by Hamas.These kinds of resolutions aren’t exclusive to the region. Time after time, governments seeking to rescue their citizens from being held hostage will insist on not engaging with the captors. Americans, for example, are very familiar with the phrase “We don’t negotiate with terrorists.” But even in the United States, no matter how much chest-thumping there is at the start of a hostage crisis, it almost always ends in paying the captors’ ransom — be it by agreeing to a prisoner swap or releasing a large sum of money.In Israel’s case, even some of the families of the Israeli hostages have for weeks been pushing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a diplomatic exchange of detainees. They summed up the proposed deal in three words: everyone for everyone — a demand that Netanyahu has so far rebuffed. But 47 days into the war, which has now killed over 14,000 Palestinians, including more than 5,800 children, it’s clear that Israel’s illegal detention of Palestinians has become a more pressing issue than ever. And how Israel chooses to address it might well determine how this war ends.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What is the Nakba?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:An Arab word for “catastrophe,” it signals a mass eviction from the 1940s that created a refugee crisis.Editor’s note, October 16, 2023: This story was originally published in May 2018. For a more recent explainer on the Nakba, watch Vox’s video, and for all our latest coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, see our storystream.The 1948 war uprooted 700,000 Palestinians from their homes, creating a refugee crisis that is still not resolved. Palestinians call this mass eviction the Nakba — Arabic for “catastrophe” — and its legacy remains one of the most intractable issues in ongoing peace negotiations.Not surprisingly, Palestinians and Israelis remember the birth of the Palestinian refugee crisis very differently (here’s a helpful side-by-side comparison). Palestinians often see a years long, premeditated Jewish campaign to ethnically cleanse Palestine of Arabs; Israelis tend to blame spontaneous Arab fleeing, Arab armies, and/or unfortunate wartime accidents.Today, there are more than 7 million Palestinian refugees, defined as people displaced in 1948 and their descendants. A core Palestinian demand in peace negotiations is some kind of justice for these refugees, most commonly in the form of the “right of return” to the homes their families abandoned in 1948.Israel can’t accept the right of return without abandoning either its Jewish or democratic identity. Adding 7 million Arabs to Israel’s population would make Jews a minority — Israel’s total population is about 8 million, a number that includes the 1.5 million Arabs already there. So Israelis refuse to even consider including the right to return in any final status deal.One of the core problems in negotiations, then, is how to find a way to get justice for the refugees that both the Israeli and Palestinian people can accept. Ideas proposed so far include financial compensation and limited resettlement in Israel, but the two sides have never agreed on the details of how these would work.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
How Israel fractured the left and united the right,2023-12-01,Vox,['Avishay Artsy'],"Filed under:What’s behind the politics shift in the United States around Israel and Palestine — and how it might affect the 2024 presidential race.At the November 14 March for Israel in Washington, DC, a bipartisan group of lawmakers delivered rousing speeches that decried the October 7 Hamas attacks and defended Israel’s military response in Gaza. Israeli and US flags waved. Tens of thousands of people filled the National Mall with calls of “no ceasefire.” On stage, Democrats Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries held hands with Republicans House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa while chanting pro-Israel messages. It was a stunning image of unity during an era of rancorous political division.Seeing Democrats and Republicans share the stage “was actually a throwback to when there wasn’t really daylight between the parties on Israel,” said David Weigel, national political reporter at Semafor.“It had the appearance of unity at a moment when there is less unanimity around support for Israel politically than any time I can remember covering,” he said.Indeed, that bipartisan display was illusory. Republicans in the House had just introduced a bill that tied Israel aid to defunding the Internal Revenue Service, a poison pill meant to paint Democrats as hostile to Israel (while also indicating GOP hostility to the other part of the bill, more military aid to Ukraine). Republicans have largely rubber-stamped Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza and backed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Democrats have been deeply divided over calls by left-leaning lawmakers for President Joe Biden to pressure Israel to declare a ceasefire.Weigel spoke with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram about how the politics around Israel and Palestine have shifted in the United States, and the implications ahead of the 2024 elections. Read on for an excerpt of the conversation, edited and condensed for length and clarity, and listen to the full conversation wherever you find podcasts.Let’s talk about October 7. What is the initial response from President Joe Biden and how much does it waver from the script that presidents have had in the preceding decades?I mean, it really doesn’t. And this is where a lot of the president’s problems with younger Democrats and critics of Israel come in. Israel is under attack, and he responds not that much differently than Richard Nixon did during the Yom Kippur War, which is, “We support Israel. They are our ally.”So October 7, there is a burst of outrage at Hamas for the massacres they carry out. That weekend, there’s a [pro-Palestinian] rally in New York, in Times Square. Democratic Socialists of America’s New York chapter endorses the rally but doesn’t organize it. Inside the Democratic Party, there’s a sort of antibody response where any Democrat who associates themselves with those protests is pilloried, is accused of supporting antisemitism, is associated with the craziest view out there of Israel. You saw the governor in New York, you saw leading Democrats, people who are going to be probably at the head of the party for quite a while, condemning this and saying that this is antisemitism. Younger Democrats see Israel as an apartheid state because they’ve seen an attempt at a peace process from Barack Obama be undermined by a pro-Trump Israeli government. What you see as the war continues is some of those prewar dynamics reasserting themselves. And by the middle of November, most Democrats say, “Yeah, I don’t want my country to be giving unlimited support to Israel no matter what they do.”Tell me about where exactly the divisions are. Who specifically is breaking away from Joe Biden and maybe even other moderate Democrats?The most obvious people doing this in Congress are members of the Squad. These are the four female Democrats who get elected in 2018, a few more Democrats are elected in 2020 and 2022, but a very small beachhead of left-wing Democratic politicians inside the House. Not really inside the Senate. You actually see a division in the first few days of the war between what those Democrats are demanding, and they’re calling pretty early for a full ceasefire. Not continuing conflict until Israel wipes out Hamas, which they say is their goal, but a ceasefire, contradictory to the Netanyahu policy. You see other Democrats like [Sen.] Bernie Sanders — who’s really influential, the John the Baptist of the Squad, really coming before them and helping them get elected — he doesn’t even do that. But you see, within days after that, Sanders and a few other Democrats, some of whom surprised people like Dick Durbin, saying, “All right, no, I don’t think we should, as Democrats, as a country, be supporting whatever this government does,” as they see footage coming in from Gaza, as they see reports of children in hospitals being starved, civilian casualties. There are incidents, for example, like reporting that a hospital was blown up by Israeli missiles that is then contested. [Rep.] Rashida Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat — Detroit and Dearborn, really — Democrat, advances that and is censured by the House for it. She sticks to her guns, she gets censured, and she gains [support], not to everything she said, but on the quest for a ceasefire, they’re adding people day by day. I mean, you have a few dozen House Democrats who’ve called for a ceasefire. That is a minority. But I think the significance here is, one, that’s a lot of Democrats criticizing Israel in wartime. That is rare. The second part is, according to polling, they’re with the base. I covered some protests where people were pretty explicit about this. They would cite polling. There was one protest at the Democratic National Committee where there are people shining lights on the building that just show the poll numbers. When you ask people if they want a ceasefire without Israel’s conditions, like 80 percent of Democrats say yes. Ipsos/Reuters’ poll is the most recent that backs that up. For a lot of these [pro-Israel elected] Democrats, it’s clear that their constituents in the Democratic base are not as interested in reflexive Israel support as they are. But it is important to discredit their opponents and say these people are crazy, these people are antisemitic, these people are dangerous. This is where the division, I think, gets a lot nastier. While this is happening, with fewer protests, they’re getting a lot of blowback from Arab Americans who think that what Biden is doing — and they knew he was pro-Israel when he won the Arab American vote in 2020 — what he’s doing is offensive to them, is murderous. You see the term “Genocide Joe” being thrown around to attack Biden. That’s what you’re seeing eating away at Democratic support is both some stuff from far-left activists, many of whom are Jewish themselves, and then some from Arab American Democrats who say, “I can’t possibly support a president”— not that they’ll support Trump — “I can’t possibly go out and support a president who, if he’s reelected, is just going to do whatever Netanyahu says.”And these few dozen Democrats who are supportive of a ceasefire, who do want to see a real shift in this war and are pushing for it in Congress, are they facing repercussions from the moderates or the staunchly pro-Israel factions? The large groups I’ve been talking about — AIPAC, which is the Israel lobby in America; Democratic Majority for Israel, which is founded more recently and works in primaries to defeat left-wing Democrats, especially if they’re Israel critics — both those groups are very clear early on that they are going to continue working to beat Democrats who are critics of Israel. And ... really within days, but it becomes a little more clear at the end of October, there is an effort to find a candidate who can beat Tlaib. There’s an effort to support one candidate who could beat Ilhan Omar. There’s an effort to beat Jamaal Bowman in New York, and Cori Bush in Missouri. So three or four of the most prominent Israel critics in the Congress: “How do we beat them?” And they’re not hiding this. It’s not like a trap they’re going to spring later. They’re saying pretty clearly, “We want candidates to run against these people.” In a couple of cases, they have them. How much of this is a generational divide within the party? Is it just young versus old, or is there something more going on here?Well, young and old explain much of it for basic reasons. If you are born after 1973, and that’s most Americans, you don’t know Israel as a tiny democracy in the Middle East that needs American protection. You know it as a powerful country with wealth comparable to a Western European country, with a strong military that never loses. Maybe [it] can get ambushed and surprised, but it doesn’t lose wars. So you ask, “Okay, why is my government supporting this?” And there’s been a search for reasons among a lot of pro-Israel Democrats: What could have done this to our younger voters? How did our young voters grow up and become Israel critics? There’s a lot of blame put on colleges. Okay. Colleges are very liberal and colleges are progressive. A few people are taught to be anti-colonial. That’s some of it. I think, in the intelligentsia of the left, everything that they say about this is true, that yes, there are people who have transposed their anti-colonial, anti-settler thinking and said “I’m against the Zionist state” for this reason. But this is across the education gap. Post-Iraq, there is a lot of skepticism. Why is America spending all this money, not just on foreign aid, but foreign aid in the Middle East in particular? Where is this going? What is the point of doing all this? And what is the point in doing it when we’re not as vulnerable as we were in the 1970s to OPEC and to oil shocks? For a lot of Americans the answer is, yeah, I don’t know. I don’t care. Why is either party so reflexively supportive of this? That’s kind of the question asked by, I’d say, Democrats across educational lines under 40. Also just younger voters generally who are very, very skeptical of this.And in the Democratic Party, we have young, we have old, and then we have really old, namely Joe Biden, who himself is older than Israel. Where exactly is he now, considering the state of affairs in his party?He doesn’t comment from day to day on critics inside the party. He’s not been baited into criticizing the left the way that AIPAC is. What Biden wants, and what he says when he’s interrupted by a Jewish Voice for Peace activist at a fundraiser, is he wants a humanitarian pause, which is, we pause the conflict. We release hostages. When the hostages are released and tensions decline, maybe we can deescalate the conflict. At no point does he say “whatever Netanyahu wants.” There is American pressure on ending hostilities as soon as possible, but it’s in the context of support for Israel, and sympathy for Israel, and sympathy for the people killed on October 7 by Hamas. It sounds like a very subtle difference. I think in some ways it is. But to activists and younger Democrats, it’s so clear to them morally that anything but demanding an immediate ceasefire and liberation for Palestinians is effectively genocide, that this is unacceptable. This is what he’s struggling to navigate. He just doesn’t have a party base that agrees that “We should take pains to protect Israel as we try to end the war.” Their position is, why? Why do they get this treatment? Why are we treating them any differently than another country that has some sort of internal population that doesn’t have full democratic rights? Or in the case of Gaza, the ability to leave the Gaza Strip freely? Why are we doing that? And that’s not something Biden can answer. That’s something that explains why he starts angering so much of the base.We’ve talked about this divide, this sort of schism on the left and all the factions involved and how complicated that mess is. I imagine this looks a lot less messy on the right?Yes, that’s a good way to put it. On the right, so, it’s always easier to be out of power in some ways. You can say, as Sen. Tom Cotton from Arkansas said, this wouldn’t happen if Trump was president. The easiest, clearest position they can take is that Joe Biden’s weak. If a war breaks out, that is because he’s weak. That is because of the decisions he made that invited this weakness. I think it is very hard to trace Biden’s decisions on Israel to that. But, you know, you’ve got a script. You’re going to stick to it. The differences between the candidates for president, I think, are significant in showing how Republicans promise to be more reflexively pro-Israel if elected, as Trump was. I mean, Trump recognizes the Golan Heights. Trump moves the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump basically does everything Israel wants and Trump says out loud, as he likes to do. So that’s Trump’s position. That has not changed. The people who are running against him — Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley being the most relevant at this point — they want to go further. They will fully support Israel, but they want to be clear that Palestinians should never get foreign aid. You also have them criticize Trump from the right by saying he’s too critical of Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump has a habit of kind of bloodlessly assessing another player in the world and saying whether they’re smart or not. Trump says that Hezbollah is smart. I don’t think the Republican base cares. Not just my view, I mean, I’ve seen polls that the Republican voters don’t see Trump’s comments as insulting to Israel. It is a very pro-Israel party. It is a very anti-Palestinian party in the conservative commentary infrastructure. You know, one of the most influential figures is Ben Shapiro, who talked about the Palestinians as animals. The phrase “Pale-swinians” has traffic on the right for a long time. On the right, there’s no danger in saying, “I support Israel. I don’t care what happens to Palestinians.” There’s a little bit of skepticism to this in the new right, in the nationalist right. There’s a little bit of the “why are we supporting them” attitude. There is a little bit of, frankly, antisemitic opposition to Israel’s existence. Not in the world of primary voters. That’s not very relevant among the people who will be nominating the party’s nominee.So we’re talking about, you know, the presidential candidates. We’re talking about the base. Somewhere in between those two are Republicans in Congress. How has this played out on the Hill?As much as we’ve been talking about America, let’s establish that the most important thing as far as Israel is concerned right now is probably not whether members of Congress say nice things about it. But most of the resolutions that have passed over the last month, or have been introduced on this, have been just condemning the attacks and then attacking Democrats who won’t condemn the attacks, passing funding with a poison pill Democrats [don’t] support, and then attacking Democrats for not supporting it. And the National Republican Congressional Committee, after the House passes Israel funding that would cut the IRS to pay for it, immediately is out attacking Democrats as, you know, anti-Israel antisemites if they don’t support it. There is more interest, just if I can speak cynically, in using this as an issue to divide Democrats than in unifying the country around one response. So not a lot has happened in Congress apart from political kayfabe. Although we know that Republicans in Congress are very skeptical of Ukraine aid, how has that played out with Israel? Is it a totally different story?Yeah. So again, the Biden position here is America needs to support Israel in its war against Hamas. It needs to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. For a lot of Republicans, it’s very clear. If there is a zero-sum amount of aid we should be giving out, including a zero-sum amount of military ordnance, bullets, etc., it should be going to defend Israel, not to defend Ukraine. That’s not unanimous in the party. But that’s the evolving Republican position, is that America’s first priority is its own self-defense, defending its own border. Its second priority is defending Israel. That’s the end of the list. There’s not really a priority in defending Ukraine right now. Why are Republicans so unified on this issue? What’s behind that?So a lot of it is a sense that Israelis are the good guys. If I can be direct about it, it is — now, there are Jews in the Republican Party; not that many — most support for Israel is driven by believing Christians, pro-Zionist Christians, who believe that Israel won its territory. It is a good steward of the Middle East. It is a democracy no matter how Palestinians within the country are treated. And it’s just not a hard call for them.You mentioned that the sort of schism on the left has cast some shadow over Joe Biden’s presidential reelection bid. Do you think that what we’ve seen in the past 50 days and what might be coming in the next 50 could have lasting implications for our election, for our politics at home — which the presidential election is now finally less than a year away. Will people still remember all of the protests in the streets and the various fights in Congress and the various fights over funding, whatever it might be?Well, there’s been a conversation on the left that I find a little tedious about, “Hey, if you’re saying that you’re going to boycott voting for ‘Genocide Joe,’ you’re effectively voting for Trump.” The other side of this will point out the election is 11 months away, a year away. This is the time to say this policy needs to change or we won’t vote for you. And so it’s unclear how much of that’s going to stick. I think overall, though, and if you talk to peace activists — Jewish Voice for Peace, IfNotNow, etc. — their theory of what might happen here, I think, has been borne out in the first month of the conflict. I talked to them early in October around this period where they’re being condemned for having the audacity to have rallies where people said crazy things. Their thought was, “We’re going to get a lot of blowback right now,” and they were. “But as this war continues, people are going to look at the images from Israel and recalculate.” I think they were correct that that happened. Each time there is a conflict — there are different levels of military strength, different leaders, etc. — each time this happens, I feel like you see a decline in reflexive support for Israel. You can see less patience for the Israeli position. Every time a conflict breaks out and especially as this conflict lasted over October, November, you saw that fade, and in ways that I think will take a couple of years to play out.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Facebook said it has taken down nearly 800 fake pages and accounts from Iran,2019-01-31,Vox,['Shirin Ghaffary'],"Filed under:The social media giant said it found 783 pages tied to inauthentic behavior from Iran.Facebook said it has removed nearly 800 pages, accounts, and groups tied to Iran for engaging in “coordinated inauthentic behavior” on its platforms.The 783 fake accounts were falsely representing themselves as locals to users in various countries, mostly focusing on the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, the company said on a Thursday press call. These fake accounts shared news stories and commentary about current events, including Israel-Palestine relations and conflicts in Syria and Yemen. Facebook said the accounts were followed by two million Facebook users and 254,000 Instagram users; the accounts spent around $30,000 for ads on Facebook and Instagram. Looking at some examples Facebook provided, the posts from these accounts seem to back political views in line with the Iranian government’s positions on foreign affairs. Several  included anti-Israel sentiment. One post was an image with French text that read, “I do not recognize Israel at all,” posted by an account called “Israel is a war criminal,” also in French. One post was pro-Russia, another critical of the government of UAE. Facebook said a more detailed report about the nature of the posts will be released by the independent Atlantic Council shortly.The company could not confirm that the posts were created by the Iranian government, but did say that they included commentary that was repurposed by Iranian state media. When asked, a Facebook representative declined to share any specific political motive behind the activity.“These were interconnected and localized operations, which used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing,” wrote Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, in a company blog post on Thursday. This isn’t the first time Facebook has taken down fake accounts from Iran or other countries. Last August, Facebook took down 650 accounts from Iran and Russia. And in April, the company took down 170 accounts from the Internet Research Agency, an organization with ties to the Russian government.The announcement comes at a time when the European Union is expected to bypass US-imposed sanctions with Iran and restart trade, despite President Trump’s urging Congress to remain tough on the country. The fact that Facebook is finding accounts tied to Iran guilty of inauthentic behavior on their platform probably won’t help negotiations.Twitter also revealed today that it took down thousands of bad-actor accounts on its platform with ties to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. Facebook said it teamed up with its social media competitor to help identify the fake accounts from Iran.This article originally appeared on Recode.net.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What is life like in Palestine? These short films offer a glimpse.,2023-11-29,Vox,['Nylah Burton'],"Filed under:3 Palestinian short films available on Netflix show life under occupation.For those wondering what life in Palestine looks like, Condom Lead (2013), directed by Palestinian twins Arab and Tarzan Nasser, offers a striking visual metaphor: The short film opens with an apartment full of balloons, drawing the viewer in. But the scripted work takes place during the first Gaza War in 2008 and 2009. Why are there so many balloons in this house during a war, when there is no celebration occurring?That night, we see the residents of the house, a married couple, as they try to have sex. They draw toward each other, softly touching feet and thighs, but they are interrupted by the sound of bombs, which makes their infant cry. The husband then takes a condom, blows it up, and lets it float through the apartment wherever it may land — on the floor, on the bookcase, on their child. We realize this is his compulsion, a coping technique, a way of keeping score of what is taken from them. Over the last seven weeks, life in Gaza has been quite literally unimaginable. Following the October 7 attacks by Hamas that killed 1,200 Israelis and Israel’s subsequent siege of Gaza with its 13,000 Palestinian deaths, there have been intermittent communications blackouts in the territory. The siege has meant Palestinians are contending with a full-blown humanitarian crisis, including attacks on refugee camps and hospitals and increased violence in the West Bank. Even knowing all that, communication failures and incredible challenges for journalists mean there is so much we don’t know. This story, however, did not begin in October 2023; the roots of the conflict reach much further back. By understanding what came before, and what everyday life looks like for people, couples, and families under occupation, we can add to our understanding of what’s happening now and how we got here. A selection of short films, all easily available on Netflix, from Palestinian directors can give viewers outside the region a sense of the alienation, oppression, and human longing that have characterized life in the territories for decades. These films tell the story of trying to make a life under sustained duress.By the end of the 15-minute Condom Lead, the apartment is even more full of balloons, representing 22 days since the couple has successfully had sex. Each balloon stands for a missed opportunity for communion, intimacy, and love. Each balloon represents an act of Israeli aggression, an occupation whose chokehold is so strong it invades even this couple’s bed. We’re not told what this couple’s plans for children are, but judging by the condoms, we know they’re not looking to conceive right now. We know, at least, that their home is currently being bombed. Not only has the military assault made having children feel fraught and dangerous, but it has taken away the opportunity for closeness. The specter of the Israeli forces looms large throughout these films, but maybe nowhere so intensely as in the Israeli prison system, the location of writer-director Rakan Mayasi’s Bonboné (2017). In this film, a Palestinian woman (Rana Alamuddin) smuggles sperm from her imprisoned husband (Saleh Bakri) so that she can become pregnant.When director Mayasi, who, like many members of the Palestinian diaspora is prevented by the Israeli occupation to visit or live in Palestine, heard stories of couples navigating love and procreation amid the prison system, he felt an urge to put it in his art. “The strength, beauty, and creativity of resisting occupation with love is a subject that needs to be told,” he says. The Israeli prison system is harrowing for Palestinians. The testimony of Mazen Abu ’Arish, a 22-year-old surveyor from the West Bank who spent 20 days in solitary confinement in Israel’s Shikma prison, speaks clearly to the spirit-breaking conditions; “In there, you have no room to move and no desire to do a thing,” he wrote.Bonboné is set against this backdrop and addresses “the issue of reproduction, both sexual and social,” says Umayyah Cable, a Palestinian-American professor at the University of Michigan who researches the role that art, film, and media play in the mobilization of Palestine solidarity politics. The film speaks “to anxieties and worries about Palestinian sexuality, the nuclear family, intimacy, and the literal reproduction of Palestinian society.” Israel does not allow conjugal visits for prisoners, so smuggling sperm is the only way families can reproduce when a partner is incarcerated. In 2020, Walid Daqqah, sentenced to life in prison, petitioned the Israeli court to allow him to have children with his wife San Salameh in a fertility clinic. His request was denied, so he smuggled his sperm to his wife, leading to the birth of their daughter Milad, whose name means “birth” in Arabic. This story inspired Mayasi. “I think such a story needs to be told,” the director told Short of the Week. “It is so beautiful to defy occupation and resist with love and life.”Conceiving in this way has an inevitable element of dehumanization, but it also shows how Palestinians resist their oppression. Bonboné doesn’t shy away from humiliation; the film shows the husband trying to masturbate as practice the night before but having trouble, his attempts constantly interrupted by sounds of prison guard announcements and metal cages clinging. It’s clear that here, in this prison, he cannot connect with himself in such an intimate way. When his wife comes the next day, her body is violated by the Israeli female prison guard, who makes her strip naked, puts her hands in her hair, and forces her to bend over and squat.“The Israeli state is extremely preoccupied with Palestinian reproduction,” Cable says. “Demographically, Palestinians outnumber Jewish Israelis. As we know from apartheid South Africa and the Jim Crow South in the US, minority rule over a majority population is not only frowned upon by human rights agencies and the United Nations, it’s recognized as anti-democratic.” In 2021, an Israeli professor argued in the right-wing tabloid Israel Hayom that, “Our strategy has to be demographic expansion and blocking Arab-Muslim migration to Israel. If we don’t understand that victory in the conflict — Jewish, or, God forbid, Arab — is demographic in nature rather than military, then we will lose.” Bonboné doesn’t end the story with degradation, choosing instead to give the couple moments of love and eroticism. When the wife sees her husband, she is joyous and hopeful, asking what they will name the child if he is a boy. When her husband informs her that he might have difficulty performing, she takes it upon herself to arouse him right there through the glass. It’s not particularly graphic, but it is beautiful. She focuses the fantasy on a time when he was free, when they made love during a stolen moment at his brother’s engagement party, when they felt connected to each other and to their community. It is hard to tell if his arousal is physical or emotional, whether he is imagining his wife’s body or simply imagining being free, being allowed to connect with another human. “I generally like to deconstruct stereotypes and challenge norms, and I found Bonboné a fruitful opportunity to do that. It innately has lovemaking in it, it is never an added scene or an added tool in the film; it is the central idea the film is built around,” director Mayasi tells Vox. “Taking the film into the genre of sensual eroticism has given the film a louder and bolder voice. This also changed the power dynamic at the prison, the couple were stronger than their occupiers.”Despite prison conditions, the husband in Bonboné is able to feel desire and connection, even through the glass. Victorious, his wife retrieves the semen from him, smuggled in a candy wrapper (hence the title, a play on the French word for candy). On the way home, her bus is stopped by soldiers who search the bus. Once again, her attempt at a family is threatened. But she is not deterred, looking around to make sure the women are either asleep or looking away, and inseminates herself right there on the bus. It is an ending that has triumph, agency, and resilience, a portrait of a people who refuse to be denied their humanity.As Palestinian film director Farah Nabulsi, director of The Present (2020), tells Vox, the systemic tyranny Palestinians face spreads to the “realm of love and intimacy.”“The pervasive stress and anxiety of living in a constant state of fear can create emotional distance and conflict in intimate relationships. Restrictions on movement and segregation policies can severely limit opportunities for meeting partners and maintaining relationships,” Nabulsi says. In The Present, Nabulsi’s film, a father in the West Bank named Yusuf (Saleh Bakri) and his daughter Yasmin (Maryam Kanj) set out on what seems a simple task: buying his wife and her mother Noor (Mariam Basha) an anniversary present — specifically, a new refrigerator. But the labyrinth of checkpoints and violence inflicted there makes what should have been a day of bonding between a daughter and father into a traumatic experience.When they first try to leave, the Israeli soldiers force Yusuf to wait in a holding pen with other men. He asks them not to because he is with his daughter, but his pleas only seem to make them more insistent on cruelty. Later, after he is released, he sees that Yasmin has urinated herself because the wait was so long and traumatic. When Yusuf expresses concern and tells her she should have spoken up, Yasmin says, “It’s okay, Dad. There was nothing you could do.” His face crumples upon hearing this. A parent’s job is to protect their child, and he is devastated to see that at such a young age, she is already learning that, in the occupation, there are limits to what her father can do to protect her. Nabulsi tells Vox that this story highlights how the occupation seeps its way into the fabric of family life for Palestinians. “In this hardship, the roots of their bond might grow deeper. The shared ordeal becomes a silent teacher of empathy. The young girl may come to understand the depth of her father’s struggles and the complexities of the world they navigate.” It’s demonstrated to both of them again, at night, as they attempt to roll the fridge past the checkpoint. Even though their house is right there, in sight, the Israeli soldiers order them to take an hours-long detour. The soldiers dehumanize the family further, searching their grocery bags to find Yasmin’s soiled pants from before and taunting them. “You’re all disgusting,” one of the Israeli soldiers spits. Yusuf pleads until he demands forcefully to be let through, resorting to yelling and banging on the table. It’s a terrifying moment: The Israeli soldier’s guns are pointed at him, and the audience imagines how this will end — a father shot to death in front of his daughter — but then we hear a creaking of the gate and see Yasmin, looking smaller than she has looked the entire film but somehow also stronger, rolling the refrigerator past the checkpoint herself. Yusuf and the soldiers are stunned, and Yusuf begins to walk alongside his daughter, who resolutely keeps going. It is a deeply sad triumph. And as Nabulsi points out, it is ultimately unrealistic. “The stark reality often dictates a grim outcome — either an encounter with deadly force or the infliction of physical injury and/or arrest. But as a storyteller often drawn to the somber hues of human experience, I felt compelled to offer an ending with more hope,” Nabulsi says. “A suggestion that hinted at a brighter future, spearheaded by the youth — interestingly, a female. It’s her, and other youth like her, emerging resilient and assertive, who captivate my imagination.” “I remain a woman anchored by hope, by an unwavering faith in the strength and potential of my community,” Nabulsi continues. “This film is a testament to that belief: a narrative that ultimately chooses to embrace the possibility of change and the promise of a generation poised to redefine their destiny.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
People living near the Ohio train derailment will have to watch their health for years,2023-02-25,Vox,['Umair Irfan'],"Filed under:It’s the beginning of a years-long effort to clean up and track the effects of chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio.Many residents of East Palestine, Ohio, have warily returned to their homes after a Norfolk Southern train derailed and spilled more than 100,000 gallons of dangerous chemicals into the air and water earlier this month. The towering smoke cloud from the burning vinyl chloride has drifted away, and the track has been cleared. Trains are now running again through the town. But the 4,700 residents of East Palestine say they still smell chemical residue in the air, see an oily sheen in the water, and are suffering from headaches and nausea. Concern is mounting about the long-term effects of the disaster.It’s also become a political football. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg visited East Palestine this week and apologized for not speaking about the derailment sooner. Former President Donald Trump also visited the town and criticized President Joe Biden for going to Ukraine this week instead of Ohio. (Trump himself has faced criticism for rolling back train safety rules.) Other government officials are trying to assure residents that much of the risk has faded. This week, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan both visited East Palestine and drank tap water in a resident’s home.  “You don’t know who to trust. That’s a big part of it — the uncertainty. You don’t know if you’re going to have to move,” one resident, Carolyn Brown, told ABC News. “We need to feel that we’re safe.”But “safe” may be more than anyone can promise. “‘Safe’ is one of those four-letter words in a [disaster] response you just don’t use,” said Stan Meiburg, executive director of the Center for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability at Wake Forest University and a former career EPA official who worked on toxic waste cleanup. “What people consider ‘safe’ is highly variable ... plus, EPA just can’t answer that question.”Instead, agencies like the EPA try to measure what they can and extrapolate from past research. They compare the concentrations of pollutants they measure to limits established by health departments, which don’t always reflect the dangers an individual will face. Children, for example, breathe in more air proportionate to their body size and thus are more vulnerable to airborne toxic chemicals. And scientists aren’t clear how the health effects of the specific toxic chemical brew that shrouded East Palestine will play out over time. Authorities nevertheless told residents they could return home. In doing so, the people of East Palestine may face low levels of exposure to some of the dangerous chemicals from the derailment, with uncertain health effects.So now begins a years-long effort to track the effects of the leaked chemicals, to mitigate their harms, to analyze why the train derailed, and to prevent the next spill. While this is uncharted territory for health and environment agencies, experts say there are some best practices to better understand the disaster and to protect residents. But they require continued attention and resources long after media coverage fades and political wrangling stops.Of the 38 cars that derailed on February 3, 11 were known to hold hazardous chemicals, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. These included chemicals like vinyl chloride, a flammable carcinogenic gas, and butyl acrylate, a toxic flammable liquid. Some leaked, some were vented, and some burned, further complicating the picture. “Each of the chemicals that leaked are respiratory irritants, and some of their breakdown products are also irritants,” said Marilyn Howarth, an environmental toxicologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, in an email. “This is part of what is unclear: How much of each was experienced by each person and for how long?”Occupational health researchers have found that workers who are regularly exposed to chemicals like vinyl chloride have higher rates of liver cancer. It’s a signal that can take 20 years or more to emerge, Howarth said. However, these workers were exposed to higher doses and in enclosed spaces, unlike the residents of East Palestine. It’s not clear how exposures from the train derailment will play out, but the long latency of vinyl chloride’s worst effects means that it’s critical to track its concentrations in the community for years to come. Meanwhile, residues from burning vinyl chloride, like dioxin, and other leaked chemicals, like butyl acrylate, can haunt water supplies for years and spread through watersheds and underground aquifers that provide drinking water.“The aquifer may remain contaminated for years, even a decade, despite best clean-up efforts in the short and long term,” Abinash Agrawal, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at Wright State University, said in an email. “This may not be a threat to breathable air quality, but definitely toxic in drinking water as it can migrate and move/travel in a groundwater plume of contamination to the pumping wells nearby up to several thousand feet.”So state and federal environmental agencies will also need to check water and soil samples regularly for contamination for years. Parts of East Palestine and the surrounding region will also have to be decontaminated, cleaned up, and remediated. The water used to extinguish the train fire is now toxic, and 2 million gallons of it are being sent to Texas, where it will be injected underground for disposal. The contaminated soil around the train tracks is being excavated and sent to a toxic waste disposal site in Michigan. The community may also have to look for a new drinking water source, Agrawal said. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation of the root causes of the train wreck. Federal regulators will have to consider whether to impose new safety regulations on the rail industry. The residents of East Palestine will also have to keep tabs on their health. Philip Landrigan, director of the public health program at Boston College, studied 20,000 first responders and rescue workers in New York City after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. He said one of the key lessons learned from that study was that in addition to figuring out exactly what was in the dust that people were breathing in, it was also important to conduct regular health assessments to catch problems that emerged over time.  “A program has to be put in place to get baseline health evaluations of people in the town, even people that appear to be okay, and follow them up periodically over the next decade or more,” Landrigan said. All these measures, however, will cost a lot of money. “You can’t expect the people who were the victims of this catastrophe to pay for that themselves,” Landrigan said. To that end, the EPA has ordered Norfolk Southern to pay for the cleanup of the train derailment and the response. If they fall short, the rail operator could face a fine of $70,000 per day according to EPA administrator Regan. “Norfolk Southern will pay for the mess that they created and the trauma that they inflicted on this community,” he said during a press conference this week. But that doesn’t account for the ongoing health needs of East Palestine, and the total medical bill could be massive. A number of residents are now looking to sue the railroad company. Norfolk Southern has also committed $5.6 million in financial assistance and support to the town.One of the biggest challenges, however, will be rebuilding trust between the community and the government. A half-dozen federal offices along with local authorities are playing roles in the disaster response, which is making it difficult for some residents to figure out who should be held accountable. And agencies like the EPA are struggling to communicate how to interpret their measurements of chemical exposures and how residents should respond to their findings. Things like quantifying the toxic chemicals in the air, soil, and water and determining that they’re below reference levels don’t address the anxiety that the people of East Palestine may feel. “One thing that I hope we will see the agency doing is recognizing that assurances to people are not just giving them numbers but rather helping them have access to resources that will help them discuss their feeling about the matter,” said Meiburg. “This has been a traumatizing event for the community,” he added. “To think about this as a ‘one and done’ experience is probably a mistake.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"""There is no defense for this"": a Palestinian rights advocate on the Gaza-Israel border violence",2018-05-17,Vox,['Alexia Underwood'],"Filed under:Yousef Munayyer discusses the Israeli and US reaction to the recent protests.It’s been a tumultuous week for anyone paying attention to recent events in Israel and Gaza.On Monday, May 14, the US officially moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and many Israelis and Americans celebrated; meanwhile, Israeli soldiers shot and killed more than 60 Palestinian protesters on the Gaza-Israel border and wounded thousands of others. In the aftermath, the international community strongly condemned Israel for its response, while the US has backed Israel’s use of force.The vast majority of protesters who participated in Monday and Tuesday’s events were unarmed, though the Israeli military claimed that some of the protesters threw Molotov cocktails and said that they shot three people dead who were trying to plant a bomb. On Wednesday, an official with Hamas said that several of the protesters who died were affiliated with them, though this has been disputed. No Israelis were injured.Palestinians are in their seventh week of protests at the Gaza-Israel border. They’re protesting the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, which is suffering from an Israeli and Egyptian blockade, and demanding their right to return to lands in Israel that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were evicted from during the creation of the Jewish state. Monday, the day the new US Embassy opened, marked the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, while Tuesday, May 15, was Nakba Day, when Palestinians commemorate their loss of land around the same time period. In light of the recent events, I reached out to Yousef Munayyer, the executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, a coalition of groups working to advocate for US policy change and to combat racism, to get his perspective on what just happened. Our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, follows.In recent days, we’ve seen the US move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. At the same time, there was this violence at the Gaza-Israel border, where Israeli soldiers shot and killed more than 60 Palestinians who were protesting.Can you explain what’s going on there? Why are people protesting?The events of the last couple days, they’re not really about the relocation of the US Embassy. There’ve been ongoing protests at the Gaza border for the past several weeks, and they’ve been planned for some time.The protests began on March 30, which is known as Land Day. This commemorates an event in 1976 when several Palestinians, who were citizens of Israel, were massacred by Israeli forces when they were protesting land confiscation. The protests then continued every week until May 15, which is when Palestinians mark Nakba Day.But really, the genesis of these events goes back 70 years, to 1948, during which time there was a massive refugee crisis that was created by the depopulation and ethnic cleansing of Palestinian towns and villages. So 1947 through 1949. The most significant year during this period was 1948. And for Palestinians, this is perhaps the most important year in their history of the people because it is the moment in which their society as they knew it was obliterated. And just so you know, about 80 percent of the population of the Gaza Strip is not originally from Gaza — even though Gaza itself has been inhabited for millennia. But most of the people there today are from surrounding towns and villages that were forced into exile in 1948. And so the people protesting today, some of them might even be the original refugees from that period. Many of them are the children or the grandchildren of refugees who have never been able to go home. I think most people around the world take for granted that every day, they are able to do something very simple, which is at the end of the day, they go home. For Palestinians, they have not been able to go home for 70 years. That day has never ended. And so this is what is at the core of Palestinian grievances.Which means that May 15 is a date that Israelis and Palestinians look at in diametrically opposed ways. This is a moment of celebration for many Israelis, and it is a moment of remembering tragedy and loss for Palestinians. So for the United States to not only make the decision that they did in terms of locating the embassy in Jerusalem, but to decide to unveil it and to celebrate it on this particular day, can only be seen by Palestinians as a deliberate effort to justify the Israeli historical narrative over the Palestinian narrative and to rub salt into the wounds of Palestinians writ large. (The protest organizers have said that they were inspired to plan the protests in the aftermath of the US decision to move the embassy.)I don’t think this level of depravity and cruelty is something that Palestinians have witnessed by the United States in the past. And I think that is important. I think it’s also important that the events of yesterday offered a juxtaposition of images from Jerusalem and Gaza, that showed American government officials clapping and singing and smiling alongside Israeli government officials while Palestinians were being massacred by Israeli troops, who were acting on Israeli government orders. That’s not something Palestinians are going to forget; that’s not something I think people of conscience around the world are going to forget. And so to the extent that the embassy move is related to the events of yesterday, it was because I think it exposed the degree to which the United States is complicit in Israel’s abuses of Palestinians. You mentioned Nakba Day, or the Day of Catastrophe. Talk a little bit more about what that means for Palestinians.The Nakba is an experience — the Palestinian experience of dispossession. It primarily refers to one period in history, when 700,000 to 850,000 Palestinians, a vast majority of the native inhabitants of Palestine, were forced from their homes and denied the ability to return. This is a central moment for Palestinians, and I think one of the reasons it’s so important is because so much of what is being done to Palestinians by the Israelis relies on a denial of Palestinian history, the creation of a myth about what the land was like before 1948, and the creation of the state of Israel. So asserting that history, remembering it, making clear what our connections to the land are, is a central part of not just Palestinian resistance today but Palestinian existence today as well.A lot of responses that we’ve heard from the Israeli government focus on Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip. They’ve said that Hamas is at fault for the violence. And on Wednesday, a Hamas official said that several of the people who were killed were affiliated with the group. What’s your response to people who make that argument?You know, I think the short response to this is that it is victim blaming. That’s what it comes down to, and you see it throughout history in many contexts. But let’s be very clear about what took place here. Overwhelmingly unarmed protesters, posing no imminent risk to people, hundreds of meters away [from the border fence] were gunned down by snipers carrying automatic weapons, sitting on dunes behind the fence. Let’s recognize what took place. I think these attempts to blame Palestinians for being killed by Israelis is just — it’s disgraceful, is what it is. It struck me as the kind of thing that you would’ve heard about civil rights protesters protesting segregation in the 1960s. As the world began to watch the beatings and the repression of protesters crossing bridges or what have you during the civil rights movement, there were people who responded, “Well, these protesters are looking for trouble. These protesters are putting themselves in danger. These protesters are responsible for the bloodshed that takes place today.” Look, protests are by their very nature a provocation. They are provoking people into asking moral questions. When Martin Luther King crossed that bridge, it was a provocation. When Rosa Parks refused to stand up, it was a provocation. When the students at Kent State went to protest the bombing of Cambodia, it was a provocation. And each and every time people were provoked into asking moral questions about what was taking place, it was the response to those protests that clarified the answer about what is right and what is wrong.And that is what is taking place in Gaza right now. People are watching this, and they understand that there is something fundamentally wrong with gunning down protesters. And I think it’s one of the things that Israel, frankly, is struggling with right now. Because they want to find a way to defend this, but there is no defense for this.And about the Wednesday comments, from the outset of these protests, there have been critics who have said this is nothing more than a desperate and cynical attempt by Hamas to try to reclaim political support among Palestinians. Some of these very same voices are now taking the statement of this one Hamas person at face value to be perfectly true without verification, and parrot it as some sort of evidence that incriminates Palestinians.It’s an odd contrast — don’t believe what Hamas says until they say something that you want to be true.The other point that needs to be made is that somebody having a membership in an organization, whatever that is, whether it’s political or on a terrorist list or whatever, does not justify their murder. It’s a very slippery slope: We’re saying that a person with a political affiliation deserves to die, regardless of whether they’re doing anything. I think that’s insane. There are many Israelis who are members of the Israeli military who are not in combat. Does that make them legitimate targets at any time, because they’re affiliated with the military?There are laws and rules that govern the use of force — it comes down to whether there’s an imminent threat to life. Whether or not you don’t like people who are from other groups — Hamas, for example — they shouldn’t be shot because they have a political affiliation. And that’s even if we are in fact taking to be true what this person said. It hasn’t been corroborated. We’re only hearing about this because it serves a particular narrative. Related to that, the US government has made the argument that Hamas is the one responsible for this violence over the past few days as well. Can you talk about the US response?The response from the White House on Monday was shocking because of how identical it was to the Israeli response on this issue. It’s really different from how the US would respond to any other government gunning down protesters anywhere else in the world, right?But what’s interesting is that the American position on these sorts of issues had evolved over time. You can go back to 2002, during the Bush administration; there was a time when the Israelis dropped a massive bomb on Gaza that killed a Hamas person that they were targeting, but also in the process killed 14 civilians that were in the neighboring area. The Bush administration condemned the attack and said that they viewed the attack as “heavy handed.” They made clear then that the United States and the Israelis don’t see eye to eye on these sorts of attacks. So it’s just remarkable to me that over time, the killing of civilians in Gaza has become normalized. And over time, there has been a complete normalization of blaming Palestinians for being killed by Israelis.It has led us to the point earlier this week where the Israelis can shoot people on video in front of the entire world and then blame someone else for it. The Israeli government used to have to respect and pay attention to the US position on that line, because if they lost the backing of the United States, they knew that they would be open to international condemnation. Now the Trump administration has taken all the brakes off and basically said, “Have at it.” The White House spokesperson was asked on Monday, “Do you think this is okay?” And he said very plainly, “We think that the people responsible for this is Hamas.”And the message sent to the Israelis is, “We’re okay with this. If you do it again, we’re not going to say anything.” That is extremely dangerous, and I think it is a clear abdication of any pretext of the United States having some sort of moral standing when it comes to this issue. Thousands of people have continued to go to the border to protest for weeks, despite how dangerous things have become. Talk a little bit about why.There are lots of different reasons why people go to protests. I think people are motivated by the difficult lives they have been forced to live, but they also want to see a better future for their children. People protest because they want to see change, and because they believe change is possible, and they have hope.There was a very good opinion piece in the New York Times written by a Palestinian in Gaza who explained why he goes out to protest.Even though he has a family and he cares about his family, and he knows that he could be risking his life, he says very simply, “I go because I hope that there is a chance that change can come, and that my children don’t have to live the difficult life that we live. And that is worth risking my life for.” I don’t want to speak for everybody who was there, I think they should speak for themselves, but I think that’s the reason why people are speaking out. They obviously believe that there’s something better out there; they want to see change. They also obviously know that it’s a risk. The Israelis have demonstrated a willingness to shoot people from hundreds of meters away in the head. They understand what’s at stake. But they also understand that life in the rest of the world is not like Gaza. That people on the other side of that fence have access to the very basic things that they’re denied. And that they deserve that as well. Given everything that’s happened this week, where do you expect things to go from here?I think in the short term, things are going to get worse before they get better. But I do think one of the things that we’ve seen over the past 10 to 20 years is a sort of clarification about what’s taking place on the ground. For a very long time, people were of the view that Israel was the David facing the Goliath and therefore needed to be supported and needed to be given the benefit of the doubt, and so on. But over time, people are realizing that that perception that they had was actually inverted. The reality is that you have a very strong and powerful Israeli state using its strength in a very unfair way against a stateless people. And I think that as people come to realize that, that is something that is going to force them to back away from supporting Israel. The Trump administration is certainly not going to do that. But I think these protests in particular have really sharpened the understanding of the power imbalance.That’s perhaps one of the most important things — that this is not about two militaries facing off against each other. This is about a military cracking down on protesters. A military that has all forms of weapons at its disposal against, you know, kids with kites and rocks and slingshots and whatever else, that they can lob 30 or 40 or 50 feet, before getting picked off by a sniper from 500 meters away.And it’s only when that realization happens, and particularly when that happens here in the United States — when people say, “We can no longer be a party to this; we can no longer continue to give Israel a blank check at the United Nations,” and so on — only then will we see real change on the ground.

What is going on with Philadelphia’s drinking water?,2023-03-27,Vox,['Li Zhou'],"Filed under:City officials say it’s safe to drink following a chemical spill and previous recommendations to use bottled water.This weekend, Philadelphia became the latest US city to navigate uncertainty about its drinking water following a chemical spill in the Delaware River from a nearby latex manufacturer. Currently, Philadelphia’s tap water will remain safe to drink through 11:59 pm local time on Wednesday, March 29, according to city officials, who’ve been conducting tests on the water supply. That’s a change from the message residents received midday on Sunday when a city text alert recommended that they use bottled water, spurring a rush to stores. Officials now say their goal is to provide more information throughout the week, with the hope that any questions about water contamination are firmly in the rearview by next week. Since the Friday spill, the city has been continually testing the water coming into the Baxter Treatment Plant, Philadelphia’s primary water treatment facility that draws from the Delaware River. Thus far, no contaminants have been detected, though officials say the chemicals involved aren’t due to fully float pass Baxter until Wednesday or Thursday this week. After they do so, officials believe that these concerns should be fully behind them within a few days. For now, officials are encouraging people to store water, and suggesting that they follow FEMA’s guidance of having three days of water on hand, which includes one gallon per person per day. City officials also said they are preparing a water distribution plan if they detect an unsafe level of contaminants in the water that Baxter is taking in. This incident, ultimately, is yet another development that renews attention to gaps in the country’s water infrastructure as well as the government’s ability to respond to chemical spills. The spill of 8,100 to 12,000 gallons of chemicals into the Delaware River occurred on Friday evening shortly before midnight at the Trinseo PLC Plant about eight miles north of Baxter. That plant, located in Bristol, Pennsylvania, in Bucks County, manufactures acrylic resins, and uses materials like those found in latex paint. Due to what the company described as an “equipment failure,” its facilities were unable to contain the chemicals — a solution of 50 percent water and 50 percent latex polymer — which then spilled into Otter Creek and then the Delaware River.Philadelphia officials are now monitoring the water in and near Baxter for three of the main chemicals involved in the incident — butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate — all of which can cause irritation if ingested, but should not be especially toxic in small concentrations, says Drexel University environmental and occupational health professor Arthur Frank. Currently, the Coast Guard is working with state and local agencies to clean up the contaminated water, with 60,000 gallons collected so far. Michael Carroll, a city official, also noted that both rain and tides in the river should help it “flush itself out” this week. Philadelphia residents can get the latest updates via the city’s website as well as from its Twitter account. Frank added that the size of the spill should reduce any potential health effects. “We have a situation where a lot of it was contained at the site of the spill but a lot of it that ended up in the creek, and in the Delaware, it’s going to be massively diluted,” he told Vox, noting that these chemicals only tend to affect people when they’re in higher concentrations. “The health effects of these materials are generally going to be seen in workplace settings at high levels of exposure.”One of the chemicals involved in the spill, butyl acrylate, is among those found in the East Palestine train derailment, a massive spill that happened earlier this year, which underscores the need for more guardrails on companies to prevent such accidents. There are important differences between the two, too: “Unlike the toxins spilled in the Ohio chemical spill after the major train derailment, environmental experts are adamant that the material shouldn’t be a concern to the public,” ABC News reports. Because of aging infrastructure, the US has experienced several major drinking water incidents in recent years with cities including Jackson, Mississippi, and Flint, Michigan, going for days without safe tap water. In both of these places, old pipes have led to lead contamination in the water or water main breaks that have allowed unsafe contaminants to leech in. In Philadelphia’s case, the inciting incident is due to a specific chemical spill rather than a problem with the city’s infrastructure. Still, Frank notes, it draws attention to other problems the city has had with drinking water in the past, and the gaps it continues to have in its facilities. It raises questions about filtration, for example, and whether the city needs better equipment to handled contaminants like these. Last year, Philadelphia also struggled with issues of lead contamination in the tap water in some schools.Additionally, Frank emphasized that this incident is a reminder that the government still needed to bolster resources that allows quicker responses to chemical spills. Officials in the area said they were stretched thin following the train derailment in Ohio, an issue that may have taken more time to rally a response. “It took us a little while to gather the resources as the Ohio incident is still draining a lot of resources regionally,” Samuel Manka, a marine science technician with the US Coast Guard, told ABC News. There are also outstanding questions about the role of government and regulation in avoiding accidents altogether. The chemical spill in Ohio, for instance, has fueled bipartisan legislation to impose new safety requirements for trains carrying hazardous materials. Meanwhile, Drexel environmental engineering professor Charles Haas told Vox that regional officials could ramp up their reviews of businesses located near the Delaware River. Greater oversight could identify whether companies are at risk of leaks like this one, which would help them assess how much of an issue it could be for them to operate near such water sources.  “We have a woefully unsupported infrastructure system on the water side and we have companies that had a problem that was likely preventable,” says Frank.

How the train industry could change after the Ohio disaster,2023-03-10,Vox,['Jonquilyn Hill'],"Filed under:The Ohio train derailment has put a spotlight on freight companies, rail safety, and how to prevent the next environmental disaster.Railroads are a fixture of the American landscape: There are about 140,000 miles of track in the United States. But most people don’t think of the trains running through our towns and cities all that often. “It was just a means of transportation for moving goods from one point to the other,” Wayne Bable told Vox’s Benji Jones last week in East Palestine, Ohio. “I mean, the trains are every 15 minutes on a regular basis. So it’s just part of life. … After a while, you don’t hear them. We sure hear them now.”It was the dramatic derailment of a train last month in his small town that changed Bable’s awareness of that regularity. On February 3, a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materials derailed near East Palestine. In its wake, concerns have been raised on the environmental impacts of the spill, and over the trains and how they run.Action in Washington has been relatively swift. There’s now a bipartisan effort to address railroad safety, and Norfolk Southern’s CEO testified Thursday before Congress. The derailment and its fallout raise a lot of questions about the rail industry, its profits, and deregulation. But in order to understand the regulatory landscape, we first need to know how the modern rail industry functions. To talk about that for an episode of The Weeds, we called Joanna Marsh, a senior staff reporter at FreightWaves, which covers freight transportation. And for a better understanding of the policy solutions, we talked to Washington Post transportation reporter Ian Duncan. Below are some of their answers to our big questions about the state of railways and the railroad industry. Host Jonquilyn Hill’s questions and the reporters’ answers have been edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to The Weeds wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, and Stitcher.Joanna Marsh: There are a lot of railroad companies operating in the United States. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, there are over 800 freight and passenger railroads. That includes subways and commuter rails and Amtrak. But you still have hundreds of railroad companies. There are three economic classes of railroads. You have your smallest companies, like mom-and-pop operations. They serve the small towns, like companies or shippers that might be there if you want to transport crushed stone somewhere or farmers who want to sell their soybeans. And then you have a slightly larger size, which means they make more money and they generate more revenue. Those include small railroads that might cover a wider territory, or they might include companies who have several of these smaller rail assets throughout the country or in a certain region. These two kinds of railroads are called short line railroads.  The last category consists of the biggest railroads, and they’re the ones who have thousands of miles of track, who make millions of dollars, and who spend millions of dollars. And they’re called the Class 1 railroads. There are seven of them right now in the United States and Canada … all of them except BNSF are publicly traded. The bulk of freight goods are transported by truck, but rail handles a sizable portion of it as well. A lot of what rail handles are bulk commodities and things that you might not necessarily need right away. So things like coal or grain, or energy products such as ethanol or crude oil. Other commodities that the railroads carry include automotive parts and vehicles. Those components kind of go back and forth between the US and Canada and Mexico. So your car might have parts that are produced in Canada and the US and is actually put together in Mexico, and then [it] goes back into the US via train. And there is also a type of rail car called intermodal cars or intermodal containers. Those are ones that carry your import goods, things that might come from the ports, inland. Joanna Marsh: Train derailments among the Class 1 railroads actually happen quite a bit. Between January and November 2022, there were 818 train derailments reported to the Federal Railroad Administration out of 1,049 total. That number is actually slightly lower than 2020 and 2021 numbers, which are hovering around 870. It’s interesting what happened in East Palestine as well, because it’s not an unusual cause to have overheated bearings.  Part of the reason you don’t hear about derailments as much is because they might be occurring in places where there just aren’t very many people around. Part of it, too, might be that the derailment isn’t as flashy, like it might not have resulted in multiple cars derailing or what derailed didn’t cause tank cars to heat up their chemicals and cause an explosion. There are various reasons why derailments occur. One could be how the track has been maintained. Another reason could be mechanical issues with the rail cars. Looking at this [East Palestine] train derailment, even though this happened on Norfolk Southern’s track and it was a Norfolk Southern train and the wayside detectors of the hot box detectors are owned and operated by Norfolk Southern, the rail cars themselves are actually not owned by Norfolk Southern. Norfolk Southern inspects the train to make sure everything looks okay. But who is actually liable for the rail car is kind of to be determined. Most rail cars are owned by either rail car leasing companies such as Trinity Industries or GATX. The other kind of rail car owners are companies — or shippers, as people call them: your chemical manufacturers or your plastics producers or your grain producers or your coal companies.Ian Duncan: So the regulation of railroads goes back to the 19th century, because it’s obviously one of the oldest big industries in the country. The modern era, starting in the 1980s, has been about deregulation. That’s where we get to today, where there is federal oversight, but it’s reasonably limited and a lot of it has to do with safety measures. There is a part of the US Department of Transportation called the Federal Railroad Administration, and they have the power to set safety rules for the railroads. It’s a little bit like the Federal Aviation Administration for planes, but they’re not running the air traffic control system in the same way. They do some hands-on stuff, they do some inspections, but it’s mostly about setting safety rules. There’s a body called the Surface Transportation Board, which has some commercial oversight of the relationships between railroads and their customers. And there was some kind of attention on that last year because there was a lot of tension about the service railroads were providing to their customers. But it’s fairly light touch regulation there. Ian Duncan: Transportation in this country … used to be much more tightly controlled. In aviation and in railroads, you’ve seen deregulation, the idea being that with the railroads, they were struggling financially. And so you had attempts to kind of free them up and help them turn into more viable businesses. And if you talk to the railroads, they would say this has been a period of real growth and financial success and that that’s good for the country because they’re providing this vital service to get goods where they need to go. There are rules around inspection of tracks and standards for maintaining tracks and equipment on railroads. I think the big thing that’s come into focus in the last decade or so and certainly in the last few weeks has been around how a special kind of train that’s called a high-hazard flammable train is regulated. They’ve come to be seen as particularly dangerous, full of chemicals that potentially can burn or explode. And so there you have a system of laws like speed limits, braking standards, much more detailed regulation about what the railroads are required to do. Ian Duncan: It’s a pretty consolidated industry, so that gives them a reasonable amount of power in Washington. They have an association that also represents them. What we’ve seen in this period where there’s been interest in trying to set new safety standards is that the railroads will often lobby against that. Their argument is that it’s a period of technological change in the industry, and so if you write rules right now, they might be outdated by the time that they’re put in place. The Obama administration made some efforts to tighten the rules. But the Trump administration was interested in deregulation especially when it came to transportation. They looked for opportunities to walk things back. The guy who ran the Federal Railroad Administration during the Trump administration had worked as a railroad executive. They were able to get some rules rolled back. Ian Duncan: An example: There’s technology that can automatically check basically the health of tracks. It’s pretty new. The industry thinks this is much better at finding potential problems on tracks that can lead to derailments or other kinds of accidents than human inspectors. And so they’ve been trying to get permission to walk back the number of visual inspections that they do and rely on this technology. The Biden administration allowed some testing to go on. But what they’ve been saying since the derailment in East Palestine is you can do both. You don’t need to get rid of the human inspections in order to use this technology; let’s do both. But the industry obviously also has a kind of commercial incentive to try and use technology that might be cheaper than having people do the work. Another one of the big disputes currently is how many people need to be on these trains. The standard at the moment is an engineer who essentially drives the train and a conductor who’s responsible for keeping tabs of what’s on the train. That was reasonably astonishing to me, when you think of just the size of these vehicles. …  There used to be five [people]. But the unions that represent these workers on the railroads are worried that the railroads are looking to go down to just one person, just an engineer, and then maybe having someone following in a truck or on the ground. The union’s view is that you can’t cut this back, that these machines do only work as well as the people. But the industry has seen it’s been able to cut the crews before and I think is interested in seeing if you can go even further. Ian Duncan: This was a huge dispute. It’s really more of a political dispute than an actual dispute. It gets back to this issue of deregulation during the Trump administration. The current emergency brakes have an air hose that sort of connects between all the cars on a train. So when it’s tripped, that signal kind of pulses down the train, so that all the cars aren’t having their brakes applied at the same time. The electronic brakes would be designed to have this kind of immediate braking on all the cars. The history is pretty tangled here, but basically the Obama administration wrote a rule and said they should be required on these high-hazard flammable trains. And Congress stepped in and said you need to have another look at that. We’re not convinced. Under the Trump administration, they tried to figure out what would be the cost to the railroads of installing these brakes and what would be the benefits in terms of preventing accidents. In their view, it didn’t pencil out, so they repealed that requirement. The train that derailed in East Palestine was not one of these high-hazard trains. It didn’t meet the definition. And so even had the rule been in place, it wouldn’t have had these brakes on and then there would have been a question about would they have helped stop it? Maybe they would have. But we just won’t know. Ian Duncan: So there’s a few things, and we’ve seen movement on some of these already. The sick leave thing. [Transportation Secretary Pete] Buttigieg has cast that as a safety measure. Essentially, if you have workers who are exhausted, who are ill and can’t take time off to get medical care, they’re not going to be working safely. Some of the railroads have sort of made some steps toward offering leave. And then the other thing that happened is that there’s a close call reporting system that’s run by the government, and that is something that the government sees as a way for workers to kind of come forward and confidentially report safety risks without feeling like there’s going to be reprisals. The big freight railroads had resisted that. The administration came down pretty hard and said that we really want you to join this. And so they’ve all agreed that they will do that. I think, looking forward, the big dispute that was already playing out before this derailment was this question of crew sizes. The unions really want to get a floor set at two. There was a bill that was introduced after the derailment that includes that idea. There are some questions about, “Could we set standards for a type of technology that is along the tracks and is designed to detect problems on the train?” — in this case, bearings that are too hot on the trains — and they did that too late. And so could we space them out differently? Could the thresholds at which they send a warning to the crew be changed? There’s interest in putting that into law. The other big thing that Secretary Buttigieg just called for in this legislation as well is to increase the fines for when railroads break these violations. They cap out at around $200,000. These are companies that make billions and billions of dollars. Buttigieg has said that’s just no kind of deterrent to them. And so, again, that legislation would also ramp up the maximum fines pretty dramatically potentially. Ian Duncan: [The train derailment] took on this political life. A lot of that has been focused on Buttigieg, and I think a big reason for that is that he’s kind of an unusual person to be transportation secretary. This is an office that — they’ve faced crashes and big disasters and things in the past, but it hasn’t been led by someone who was so political and is presumed to have continuing political ambitions. And so Republicans in Congress had already been looking for opportunities to criticize him. Especially with air travel, winter was pretty messy. And so they tried to lay some of that his door — some of it, I think reasonably so. The question was where is he? Why hasn’t he showed up? It is interesting to see this kind of two-track political response, because [Republican Sens.] J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio, for example, have been some of the loudest critics of Buttigieg over all of this, and yet they’re sponsors of this legislation that does a lot of the things that he’s also been calling for. So when you get down to specifics, there seems to be maybe some room for agreement.

What is the West Bank?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:The West Bank is a chunk of land east of Israel, home to nearly 3 million Palestinians.Editor’s note, November 9, 2023: This story has been updated to reflect details of the current Israel-Hamas war. For all of Vox’s latest coverage on Israel and Palestine, see our storystream.The West Bank is a chunk of land east of Israel. It’s home to nearly 3 million Palestinians, and would make up the heart of any Palestinian state. Israel took control of it from Jordan in 1967 and has allowed Jewish settlers to move in, but Palestinians (and most of the international community) consider it illegally occupied Palestinian land.In 1967, Israel fought a war with Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. Israel fired the first shot, but claims it was preempting an imminent Egyptian attack; Arabs disagree, casting Israel as an aggressor. In six days, Israel routed the Arab powers, taking the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan.Israel has controlled the West Bank since the Six-Day War, as it’s called. For many Jews, this is wonderful news in theory: the West Bank — which Israel also calls Judea and Samaria —was the heartland of the ancient Jewish state. It’s home to many Jewish holy sites, like the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, that Jews were previously cut off from. In practice, Israeli control of the West Bank means military administration of a territory full of Palestinians who chafe under Israeli restrictions.The border between Israel and the West Bank would probably have to change in any peace deal.There are about 700,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank, many of whom live near the border with Israel. In a two-state deal, a significant number of settlers — two years ago, the number was estimated around 185,000, a number that’s likely only grown — would have to leave the West Bank, while some border settlements would become Israeli land. In exchange, Israel would give over some of its territory to Palestine. These would be called “land swaps.” No set of Israeli and Palestinian leaders have agreed during peace negotiations on where, exactly, the borders should be.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Where was the Israeli army on October 7?,2023-10-16,Vox,['Liz Scheltens'],"Filed under:For decades, Israel has prioritized illegal settlement for Jewish Israelis in the West Bank.In the early hours of Saturday, October 7, Israelis living near the border with Gaza awoke to the sounds of Hamas fighters killing and kidnapping their neighbors. As the hours stretched on and they hid, terrified, their frantic text messages contained versions of this question: where is the army?To answer that question, we need to travel to the West Bank. Watch the video above to better understand how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s obsessive focus on the West Bank has left Israelis everywhere vulnerable.Further reading and sources:

"""History repeating itself"": How the Israel-Hamas war is fueling hate against Muslims and Jews",2023-10-31,Vox,['Fabiola Cineas'],"Filed under:There’s a surge in reports of assaults, vandalism, harassment, and intimidation. Deadly violence in the Middle East is spurring attacks and heightening fear in Muslim, Jewish, and Arab (especially Palestinian) communities across the United States. In Illinois, about a week after Hamas militants attacked Israel, a landlord stabbed his tenants, 6-year-old Wadea al-Fayoume and his mother Hanaan Shahin, more than two dozen times for being Muslim, according to the police. Only the mother survived and told a relative that the landlord yelled “you Muslims must die!” as he choked her. Police opened a hate crime investigation this week after a man in Los Angeles was yelling “free Palestine,” “kill Jews,” “brown people matter,” and “Israel kill people,” and kicked in the back door of a Jewish family’s home and entered. Israel’s airstrikes in the past three weeks have killed more than 8,000 Palestinians, most of them women and minors, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Hamas’s attack killed more than 1,400 Israelis, and the group is still holding about 200 people hostage, according to the Israeli government. As the war continues, law enforcement officials expect hate crimes reports to only increase: The FBI warned last week that “the volume and frequency of threats to Americans, especially those in the Jewish, Arab American, and Muslim communities in the United States, have increased, raising our concern that violent extremists and lone offenders motivated by or reacting to ongoing events could target these communities.” At the Pennsylvania state Capitol, a man pulled up to a pro-Palestine protest, yelled out anti-Muslim and racist slurs, and pointed a gun at rallygoers from his car. In California, synagogues and Jewish-owned businesses have been vandalized since the start of the war. Flyers with anti-Jewish rhetoric — including “Jews wage war on American freedoms!” — were placed on vehicles across Orange County. A man in Illinois was charged with a hate crime after threatening to shoot two Muslim men and yelling slurs at them. A Muslim all-girls school was on “soft-lockdown” after receiving a “threatening hate letter” that applauded the killing of al-Fayoume and included “racist, anti-Palestinian, and anti-Muslim language, and discussed killing Muslims and Palestinians.” Owners at a New York City Palestinian restaurant, who publicly called for an end to what they deemed Israel’s “apartheid,” disconnected the restaurant’s phone over threatening voicemails. The restaurant has received nonstop one-star reviews since the start of the conflict; a man entered the dining room in the past week, shouting “terrorist” at the workers. College campuses have become breeding grounds for a host of antisemitic and anti-Muslim acts, leaving students fearful that they are unprotected from intimidation and possible violence. The FBI’s national hate crimes data is reported on a yearly basis, and the agency has not released specific numbers about the increases they’ve seen in threats and hate crimes against Palestinians, Jews, or Muslims have risen in the past few weeks. Even so, the FBI’s latest hate crimes report, released on October 16, showed that hate crimes were already on the rise in the past year. Hate crimes increased by 7 percent in 2022 compared to 2021. Anti-Jewish attacks, the second highest hate crimes category after anti-Black, rose to 1,124 incidents. There were 158 reported anti-Muslim incidents and 92 reported anti-Arab incidents. The numbers are an undercount. Many police departments opt out of submitting hate crime data to the FBI, and it remains difficult for officers to prove that a reported crime was motivated by bias. Fear and distrust of law enforcement among victims of certain populations, such as Muslim communities, leads to underreporting. Nevertheless, the number of incidents represents the highest number recorded since the FBI began collecting this information in 1991. One expert told Vox that the current uptick in today’s anecdotal reports can be explained by “scapegoat theory,” the idea that certain marginalized groups should be blamed for various societal conditions or events.   “I won’t be surprised if there’s a spike in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents during this period,” said Frank S. Pezzella, an associate professor of criminal justice at John Jay College and author of the book Hate Crimes Statutes: A Public Policy and Law Enforcement Dilemma. “When these kinds of world events take place, whether here or abroad, people feel strongly about them. And when people have strong beliefs, they act out. They look at people in their neighborhoods and blame them for what is happening in the Middle East, or they blame all Asian people for what started in Wuhan, China.” There might be an uptick in hate crimes right now, which one expert said could lead to a longer-running increase. “These kinds of spikes in hate crimes are unlike 20 years ago because they are elongating,” said Brian Levin, the founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. “We aren’t only seeing a higher number occur but that increase is resilient and plateaus for longer. Or, after a period when hate crimes have gone down, we sometimes see them reignite like a wildfire.” In a midtown Manhattan subway station after the onset of the war, a man punched a woman in the face and told her it was because “you are Jewish.” Several Jewish synagogues in Utah are “on high alert” after receiving threats in the past two weeks. A rabbi in Salt Lake City interrupted his synagogue’s service to evacuate the congregation after receiving a bomb threat by email. Swastikas and pentagrams have popped up at Jewish businesses and on public property, forcing some to remove their mezuzahs, a piece of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah that some Jewish people put on the doorframe of their homes. Jewish schools have increased security out of fear. On October 24, the Anti-Defamation League, the main source for tracking antisemitic incidents (assault, vandalism, and harassment), released a statement that said there were 312 antisemitic incidents between October 7 and 23, 190 of which were directly linked to the war in Israel and Gaza. For comparison, the organization received reports of 64 incidents during the same period last year. An ADL spokesperson told Vox that the count includes 49 incidents of vandalism, 10 instances of assault, and 253 incidents of harassment, which includes 108 anti-Israel rallies in which the organization found “explicit or strong support for Hamas and/or violence against Jews in Israel.”Antisemitism was already on the rise before October 7. The FBI’s latest data confirmed the antisemitism trends that the ADL has recorded in recent years, Jonathan Greenblatt, the organization’s CEO, said in a statement. By the ADL’s count, which includes criminal and noncriminal acts of violence against Jews, there were a total of 3,697 antisemitic incidents in 2022, the highest number recorded since the ADL’s data tracking began in 1979. Assaults, considered the most serious offenses, increased by 26 percent that year. While Jews make up just 2 percent of the US population, antisemitic hate crime incidents accounted for 9.6 percent of all hate crimes recorded by the FBI. In the past few years, experts have disagreed about why hate crimes against Jews have surged, a debate that hinges in part on how such crimes are defined and categorized — in the past, the ADL has been criticized for characterizing some anti-Israel statements as antisemitic. The ADL’s data for 2022 found that antisemitic harassment made up the bulk of the reported incidents, with 2,298 incidents, followed by vandalism, with 1,288 incidents. Antisemitic assaults made up 111 of the reported hate crimes and 107 of them were perpetrated without the use of a deadly weapon. There was one fatality, according to the data. Other acts that have drawn attention and controversy — notably people tearing down fliers of Israeli hostages — are not classified as hate crimes or antisemitic incidents by either the ADL or the FBI. An ADL spokesperson told Vox that the organization did not include the tearing down of Israeli hostage posters as acts of violence or antisemitism in its latest count since it is “still determining whether that meets our criteria.” When asked whether the FBI was investigating the tearing down of posters as a hate crime the spokesperson told Vox, “Not all acts of hate are hate crimes. For us, there needs to be a threat of violence or violence associated with the act for it to reach the federal level.”“Pulling down a flier, that’s just not a hate crime. But it is emotional. If I were leading a police department, I’d want to get people to not do that, because invariably, there will be fights that happen as a result,” Pezzella said. “If someone snatches a flier, and then someone hits them for doing so, [the altercation] borders on the line of bias motivation.” There is some evidence that antisemitism increases with flare-ups in the Middle East, and that this has been the case for some time. “We have seen anti-Jewish hate crimes go up to decade and or multi-year highs fairly consistently when there’s violent conflict between Israelis and Palestinians,” Levin said. Using FBI data, Levin found that in March 1994, there was a spike in anti-Jewish hate crimes from 79 incidents to 147 a month after an American Israeli extremist opened fire on Palestinian Muslims praying in a mosque, killing 29 of them. In October 2000, anti-Jewish hate crimes in the US increased from 81 to 204 after a series of mass protests by Palestinians in Israel. There were surges in antisemitic incidents in May 2021 in cities with large Jewish populations such as New York and Los Angeles after fighting broke out between Israel and Hamas over Israel’s threats to evict Palestinian families from East Jerusalem. The FBI announced that “foreign adversaries” are trying to “take advantage of the conflict.” For example, on October 19, an ISIS media posting urged followers to “target the Jewish presence all over the world…especially Jewish neighborhoods in America and Europe,” and specifically encouraged attacks on Jewish temples, nightclubs, and economic interests and against “Jewish and Crusader” embassies, according to the FBI. The Boston police department has opened an investigation after someone reportedly sprayed the word “Nazis” on a sign for the Islamic Seminary of Boston and the Palestinian Cultural Center for Peace in Allston, Massachusetts. The Cleveland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is calling for state and federal law enforcement to open a hate crimes investigation into an alleged vehicular assault on a Palestinian American man. According to the victim, the driver of the car yelled, “Kill all Palestinians” and “Long live Israel!” The car swerved at him and the driver shouted, “Die!” when he hit him and took off. Dearborn, Michigan, one of the country’s largest Arab communities, has experienced several threats of violence. Police arrested a man in connection with a social media post in which he was seeking companions to “go to Dearborn & hunt Palestinians.”The violence abroad has created violence and fear in the US for Palestinians and Muslims, and for Arabs in general, as well as people incorrectly perceived to be a member of those groups, including Sikhs. Sikh men, who grow long beards and wear turbans as part of their religion, Sikhism, sometimes get mistaken as Muslim and have faced anti-Muslim violence as a result.  Hate crimes against these communities remain underreported. The University of California Berkeley’s Othering & Belonging Institute, which tracks anti-Muslim discrimination worldwide, released a US study in 2021 that found that 55 percent of those who faced Islamophobia said they did not report it to authorities. CAIR has said it has received 774 complaints and reported bias incidents against Muslims between October 7 and October 24. CAIR says the number is the highest recorded since 2015, when Donald Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” Abed Ayoub, the national executive director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), told the Associated Press that the organization has received more than 100 reports that include threats, verbal harassment, intimidation, and physical attacks since October 7. In one case the organization has highlighted, a Palestinian American family received death threats at their home and business, with callers stating “we’ll kill all you Palestinians” and “we’ll kill your family.” Following the threats, the family believes someone fired a bullet through their living room window. “It’s very reminiscent of the early days of post-9/11, where people didn’t want to go outside, they didn’t want to send their kids to school,” Ayoub said. “They’re just worried about being in public and being approached.”After the al-Qaeda terrorist organization attacked the Twin Towers and Pentagon on September 11, 2001, Muslims and Arab Americans faced an unprecedented amount of hate and violence in the US. They received death threats and were harassed as mosques were burned down. Those perceived as Muslim were beaten and held at gunpoint. The number of assaults against Muslims rose significantly between 2015 and 2016, amid President Trump’s rise, and surpassed the 2001 peak. Anti-Muslim intimidation, or reasonable fear of bodily harm, made up the bulk of the incidents followed by assault, and then property damage and vandalism.  Post-9/11 surveillance has left Muslims distrustful and fearful of law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts that have targeted them. A few days after Hamas’s attack on Israel and as Israel began striking Gaza, the ADC said that it fielded reports that federal law enforcement had visited mosques and questioned and detained Palestinians in the US. In one report, the FBI allegedly visited a Texas mosque to ask about “troublemakers” in the community. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security did not respond to the Intercept’s questions about the visits.  “We’re seeing a lot of Palestinian students threatened with violence and anti-Palestinian and Islamophobic messages,” said Radhika Sainath, a senior staff attorney at Palestine Legal, an organization that represents individuals who face consequences for speaking publicly about Palestinian rights. According to Sainath, the organization has received “a tsunami of requests for help.” They’ve received more than 400.  Stereotypes seem to be fueling the incidents. “The stereotyping we are seeing right now are the classic anti-Palestinian or anti-Arab tropes,” Sainath said. “That Palestinians are all terrorists. That they want to kill babies and that they’re rapists. That they’re not people who have feelings and deserve empathy, human rights, and to live in equality. People are spreading the idea that [Arabs and Palestinians] are scary in some ways.”In response to the reported increase in violence, the protests that have erupted nationwide, and heightened fear, the FBI and other law enforcement bodies have launched plans to increase surveillance across a variety of communities. “In recent years, there have been several events and incidents in the United States that were purportedly motivated, at least in part, by the conflict between Israel and HAMAS. These have included the targeting of individuals, houses of worship, and institutions associated with the Jewish and Muslim faiths with acts of physical assault, vandalism, or harassment,” the FBI said in a statement. The FBI did not release numbers about the threats, but said many were made online and that many turned out not to be credible. President Joe Biden acknowledged the concerns on X, formerly known as Twitter. “VP and I spoke with our national security teams to discuss ongoing steps to protect the homeland, including Jewish, Arab, and Muslim communities, following the attacks in Israel,” he wrote. In a recent Oval Office address, he stated that Americans could “not stand by and stand silent” in the face of such hate. Biden met with Muslim American leaders about how to combat anti-Muslim sentiment at the White House on Thursday in a meeting that was not on his public calendar. Muslim and Arab American leaders have criticized the president, saying that he seems indifferent to Palestinian civilians, as he pledges support for Israel. Biden spoke to Jewish leaders about antisemitism on October 11. The rhetoric of the US leadership can have a major impact, according to Levin. “Civics matters now. When [President] Bush spoke about tolerance for Muslims six days after 9/11, we saw that hate crimes dropped precipitously the next day,” he said.National and local organizations are calling for greater governmental and community support, as the upcoming 2024 presidential election is expected to keep surges in hate crimes elevated. “With antisemitic incidents up across the board in nearly every category we track, a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach is needed to address these disturbing trends,” said Greenblatt. In May, Biden launched the country’s first national strategy to combat the rise in antisemitism. In September, the administration announced that it would use the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit antisemitism and Islamophobia in federally funded programs and activities. “What we have to do now is make sure that structures for coordination within faith communities are maintained,” Levin said. People must also be aware of where to report hate crimes, Levin said, citing that some states, including California (833-8-NO-HATE) and New York (1-888-392-3644 or text “HATE” to 81336), have hate crimes hotlines. “Police departments all across the country must make sure they have plans for houses of worship, community centers, and protests.”Update, October 31, 11:40 am: This story was originally published on October 31 and has since been updated to include the fact that Palestine Legal has received over 400 requests for help since October 7.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
How to think through allegations of genocide in Gaza,2023-11-13,Vox,['Nicole Narea'],"Filed under:What we talk about when we talk about genocide.As the civilian death toll continues to rise from Israel’s war in Gaza in response to Hamas’s October 7 attack, more and more voices have warned of genocide.On November 2, United Nations experts said in a joint statement that Palestinians in Gaza were at “grave risk of genocide.” And on October 28, the director of the New York office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stepped down because, as he wrote in his resignation letter, “we are seeing a genocide unfolding before our eyes [in Gaza] and the Organization that we serve appears powerless to stop it.” More than 800 scholars have also recently signed on to a letter aiming to “sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide.” And US Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), the only Palestinian American in Congress, accused President Joe Biden of supporting “the genocide of the Palestinian people,” in a video on November 3.These warnings have pointed to the sheer number of civilian casualties from Israel’s bombardment, the effects of the siege, and rhetoric from Israeli officials that demonizes and calls for the mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza, among other things, as indicators that Israel’s offensive against Hamas could cross the line into genocide. That is an explosive charge, and one that Israel, a nation whose existence is inextricably linked to the genocide of Jews in the Holocaust, has rejected by arguing that the killing of innocents is unavoidable in pursuit of its war aims. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]As bloody as the war in Gaza has been so far, it may not fit the popular conception many have of genocide from the 20th century, when the death tolls were far larger and, in retrospect, the intent by perpetrators to wipe out an entire people was undeniable. But there are different ways to define genocide — from the colloquial to the scholarly and political to the strict legal sense. And it is the legal definition, which includes a narrow set of criteria, that ultimately determines formal accountability. On that score, most experts, with a couple of prominent exceptions, say that it is not possible to prove Israel’s actions meet that legal threshold right now. “I don’t think it’s genocidal yet. I think it can easily be,” said Ernesto Verdeja, an associate professor of political science and peace studies at the University of Notre Dame. “At this point, it’s a little hard to put all the pieces together.”With more than 10,000 Palestinians dead, according to the latest estimates from the Gaza Health Ministry, the humanitarian situation is unquestionably urgent. Many experts Vox spoke to agreed that war crimes had likely been committed both by Hamas and Israel throughout this conflict. In some ways, the semantic fixation on whether what’s happening in Gaza is or isn’t genocide under the legal framework risks losing sight of that larger picture. Experts pointed out that charges of “genocide” carry no more legal or moral weight than “crimes against humanity” or “war crimes” under international law.

  But it’s also true that the words we use to describe the conflict carry real weight. And that is why, at a moment when all the world is weighing the atrocities and victimizations of one side and the other, it is so vital to understand what is meant, and what isn’t, by the term “genocide.” There are four main ways to conceptualize genocide, according to Verdeja, and each depends on how and where the term is being used — whether in the legal world, the realm of social science, the arena of international politics, or among the general public. That means what might constitute genocide to many members of the public might not to someone with a background in international law. First, there’s the legal definition. According to the Genocide Convention, which entered into force in 1951 and has been ratified by 153 states, genocide means “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”: Notice that there are two components here. One is a physical element — the five acts just listed — which can be empirically determined. But the other is a mental element — the “intent to destroy” a group “as such” — and that’s much harder to prove. By “as such,” the Convention means that the victims must be deliberately targeted not as individuals but because of their membership in a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group and as part of a broader plan to destroy that group. That second part is key: Not every violent attack against civilians — even if it is motivated by national, ethnic, racial, or religious bias — qualifies as genocide. It has to be intended to eliminate the group as a collective. (Note that genocide can be perpetrated against only part of a group, so long as it’s an identifiable and substantial part.) To prove that intent exists, court precedent has also required the “existence of a state or organizational plan or policy.” The statements of public officials and other decision-makers can help support that case, though they may not be enough alone. It’s even more difficult to prove that the threshold has been met while the atrocities are still ongoing. Only three genocides in history have been officially recognized under the definition of the term in the 1948 Genocide Convention and led to trials in international criminal tribunals: one against Cham Muslim and ethnic Vietnamese perpetrated by Khmer Rouge leaders in Cambodia in the 1970s, the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and the 1995 Srebrenica Massacre in Bosnia. (The Holocaust occurred before the adoption of the 1948 Convention.) The mass killings of the Yazidis by ISIS in Iraq and of the Rohingya in Myanmar have been recognized as genocide by the United Nations as a whole. Though the US called the killing of Black Africans in the Sudanese region of Darfur between 2003 and 2005 “genocide,” a UN investigation ruled it was not genocide. The prosecution of genocide is rare in part because its definition under the Convention is the product of post-World War II compromise among UN member states and narrow by design so that certain atrocities they had perpetrated would not be recognized as genocide: for example, mass killing and famine in the Soviet Union and lynchings and racial terror in the US. But that definition proved perhaps too narrow to effectively prevent and respond to genocides when they happen. That has left some searching for a more expansive definition.So, secondly, there’s the way the term “genocide” is used in social science. “The social-scientific approach, I think, tends to be a bit more capacious,” Verdeja said, noting most academics don’t require proving “intent” beyond a reasonable doubt and don’t require victims to be in the Convention’s four protected groups. Social scientists might count a political group as a victim of genocide, for example including the Khmer Rouge’s political victims in addition to the legally recognized victims. “But that’s also partly because the purpose is different, right? We’re not using that for purposes of holding an individual accountable, or holding the state accountable at the International Court of Justice.” Third, there’s the way “genocide” is used in the international politics and policy world. “They’re thinking specifically around questions of prevention policy and intervention,” Verdeja explained. “Many international organizations and governments will use the term genocide when what they really mean is large-scale violence against civilians.” That’s because those entities are more concerned with trying to identify instances where there might be outbreaks of grave human rights violations that merit an international policy response, ideally to prevent those violations from worsening, rather than being concerned with the strict legal definition. “So if you spend a lot of time talking to the State Department ... that’s kind of loosely how they use ‘genocide,’ even though they know the legal definition,” Verdeja said. Fourth, there’s the way “genocide” is colloquially used by the public. “There, genocide tends to be used as a stand-in term for the greatest evils, the greatest harms that human beings experience,” Verdeja said. Typically, this is about using the moral and emotional weight of the term to make a political claim: The current situation is unacceptable, and something must be done.For the purposes of holding Israel accountable for its actions in Gaza, however, it’s the legal framework that matters most. And that’s why debates have focused on whether that strictest definition of genocide applies.Experts in human rights and war crimes are generally hesitant to call Israel’s killing of Palestinians in Gaza “genocide” as understood in international law. That’s especially the case in the absence of “clear evidence verified by a third-party investigation,” said Franziska Boehme, an assistant professor of political science at Texas State University.But several of the scholars Vox spoke to caution that the violence could certainly become genocidal, that it may already be perilously close to meeting the threshold, and that the international community must hold Israel responsible for any atrocities it may have committed and prevent further ones, regardless of how we define them. Israel has already killed and injured Palestinians in Gaza en masse, mostly women and minors. There is no specific threshold number of deaths or proportion of a group killed required under the Genocide Convention or resulting case law, only that they be substantial.Israel has said its siege and bombardment of Gaza — which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on November 3 will continue with “all of [Israel’s] power” — is intended to eliminate Hamas, after the horrors of October 7. It has denied that it intentionally targets civilians, and in a statement to Insider, the IDF said it is “fully committed to respecting all applicable international legal obligations,” putting procedures in place to ensure as much. Instead, it says civilian deaths are the unfortunate collateral damage of its war on Hamas, which Israel has accused of hiding behind civilian infrastructure. International law does not outright ban civilian casualties during war. Principles around “proportionality,” for instance, imply that some civilian deaths can be acceptable depending on the military objective. But hundreds of scholars and practitioners of international law have argued that, beyond any one incident, the “widespread killing, bodily and mental harm, and unviable conditions of life” that Palestinians are being subjected to means there is “a serious risk of genocide being committed in the Gaza Strip.” Beyond killing civilians en masse, Israel appears to be inflicting “conditions of life calculated to bring about [the targeted group’s] physical destruction,” as prohibited by the convention, said Adam Jones, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia who has written a textbook on genocide. He pointed to Israel’s decisions to let in only limited humanitarian assistance that is far from sufficient to provide for the needs of 2.2 million people; to cut off fuel, water, and electricity; and to deprive people of adequate access to medical care. As of November 5, some 370 aid trucks had reportedly arrived in Gaza since they were first allowed to enter on October 21, but more than 100 trucks daily would be required to meet the needs of the population.Some human rights lawyers and scholars say that entertaining allegations of genocide against Israel at this point is not just premature, but also cheapens the concept. Dov Waxman, a professor of political science and Israel studies and the director of the UCLA Y&S Nazarian Center for Israel Studies, writes in Jewish Currents that while there may be a “risk of genocidal actions” in Gaza, claims that it is happening now require “stretching the concept too far, emptying it of any meaning.” Eitay Mack, a human rights lawyer based in Jerusalem, writes in Haaretz that the accusation of genocide is “a false claim not founded in international law” and one that “will not be useful for ending the war or promoting the freedom of the people in Gaza.”Among those who do see substantial risk of genocide, though, the biggest sticking point in the debate centers on what Israel’s intentions are. Verdeja said that intentionality is tough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, especially “when you’re looking at these types of atrocities happening in real time.”Michael Becker, an assistant professor of international human rights law at Trinity College, Dublin, similarly said that “because the requirement of genocidal intent has been construed so restrictively by international courts, it is not obvious that Israel’s actions satisfy the legal definition of genocide, notwithstanding the evidence of mass atrocity.”The same hurdle of proving intentionality applies to any evaluation of whether Hamas’s October 7 attack constitutes genocide. Hamas, which governs Gaza and is designated by many countries as a terrorist organization, promises the destruction of Israel in its founding charter and has said it has plans for more attacks like the one on October 7. Its “wild and indiscriminate killing” of more than 1,400 people is characteristic of what social scientists refer to as a “genocidal massacre” that should be “acknowledged and condemned as such,” but the intentionality requirement under the law is still a “high evidentiary bar to reach,” Jones said. Raz Segal, an associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Stockton University, said that Hamas’s charter alone isn’t enough to prove intent as required by the narrow definition in the Convention. “I definitely see intent to kill a significant number of members of the group, to instill unbelievable trauma and terror among members of the group,” he said. “But I don’t see intent to destroy in relation to the Hamas attack that would render it an act of genocide.” Similarly, there is already some support for the notion that Israel is intentionally trying to destroy the Palestinian population in Gaza, though, again, proving that intent requires clearing a high bar. Scholars have pointed to statements by Israeli leaders as one piece of evidence that the country’s military campaign may be targeting Palestinians in Gaza broadly.A short, non-exhaustive list: Prime Minister Netanyahu pledged to reduce parts of Gaza “to rubble” and invoked the people of Amalek, the foe that God ordered the ancient Israelites to genocide in the Bible, in a recent speech. Defense minister Yoav Gallant called for a “complete siege” on Gaza and stated that “we are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly.” Army spokesperson Daniel Hagari said forces would turn Gaza into a “city of tents” and admitted that Israel’s “emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy” in dropping hundreds of tons of bombs on Gaza. These are people directly presiding over or involved in the military operations in Gaza, whose words carry more weight. But Israeli lawmakers and officials have also been invoking dehumanizing language that experts say should not be overlooked in evaluating Israel’s ambitions. Israeli President Isaac Herzog blamed Palestinian civilians in Gaza as a whole for Hamas’s October 7 attack: “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible.” Amichay Eliyahu, the minister of heritage, told a Hebrew radio station that there were no non-combatants in Gaza and advocated for dropping a nuclear bomb on the territory. (Netanyahu suspended Eliyahu, but reportedly gave in to pressure from his other coalition members and did not fire the minister entirely.) Revital Gotliv, a Parliament member from Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party, called for Israel to use nuclear weapons in Gaza: “It’s time for a doomsday weapon. Shooting powerful missiles without limit. Not flattening a neighborhood. Crushing and flattening Gaza.” Galit Distel Atbaryan, also of Likud, posted on X in Hebrew that Israelis should invest their energy in one thing: “Erasing all of Gaza from the face of the earth” and forcing the “Gazan monsters” either to flee the strip to Egypt or to face their death. Comments like those prompted Segal to argue in Jewish Currents recently that Israel’s actions constitute a “textbook case of genocide.” He told Vox that those statements, indiscriminate bombing of civilians, and cutting off of resources taken together point to the requisite “intent to destroy.” “If this is not special intent to destroy, I don’t know what is,” Segal told Vox. “How many Palestinians need to die for these statements to be recognized as what they are?”Israel, for its part, has urged civilians to move south as its troops encircle Gaza City and warned that anyone who remains could be seen as “sympathizers of a terrorist organization.” But some are unable to move or have refused to move, fearing permanent displacement from their homes. Israel is continuing its bombardment, even on corridors to the south. Its reliance on aerial bombing, as opposed to “ground-level, up-close-and-personal killing,” may allow for “obfuscation” about who exactly it’s targeting, Jones said.When Israel first bombed the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza City, where it claimed to have killed a Hamas commander, it did so knowing that many civilians there would die. “This is the tragedy of war,” an IDF spokesperson told CNN. Israel has since rebuffed UN concerns that the bombing could constitute a war crime and bombed the site two more times, leveling every building in an approximate area of at least 2,500 square meters and resulting in reportedly hundreds of deaths and injuries. “Attacking a camp sheltering civilians including women and children is a complete breach of the rules of proportionality and distinction between combatants and civilians,” UN experts said in last week’s joint statement.Though some have pointed out that Israel could have killed even more people in Gaza if it really wanted to do so, it does not necessarily have to unleash its full arsenal to commit genocide. “It’s quite plausible that the state uses some of its firepower and nevertheless is carrying out the attacks in the context of the destruction of the target group,” Verdeja said. All of this suggests that Israel’s operations in Gaza are “definitely going in the direction” of genocide, Verdeja said.Ultimately, experts said, the debate over whether what we’re seeing in Gaza is or isn’t genocide risks overshadowing the gravity of the harms that are being committed. There are other terms that might end up being more appropriate, after independent bodies conduct third-party investigations and scholars evaluate the conditions. In the legal arena, a group of independent UN experts says Israel’s siege and bombardment constitute collective punishment — the harming of a person or group of people based on the actions of another member of their group — which is a war crime prohibited under the Geneva Conventions. Some experts also warn that Israel’s campaign against Hamas might become an “ethnic cleansing” of Palestinians in Gaza writ large. That term carries no legal weight, but it is used by scholars to describe operations aimed at making a geographic area ethnically homogeneous, often through tactics that can constitute war crimes, like indiscriminate killings or forced displacement.“Debates about whether Israel’s actions constitute genocide or ethnic cleansing are an unhelpful distraction from the fact that we are witnessing a situation of mass atrocity involving what appear to be egregious violations of international law, and that states need to press upon Israel to adopt a radically different approach in responding to the threat posed by Hamas,” Becker said.The term “genocide” grabs the world’s attention. But the devastation in Gaza should command attention just as much even if “war crimes” or “crimes against humanity” turn out to be better descriptors from a legal point of view. “These terms also speak to horrible atrocities and should be taken no less seriously,” Becker said. “It’s important to remember that there is no hierarchy among crimes under international law,” Amnesty International said in a statement. “As stated in the preamble of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes all are ‘the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole [and] must not go unpunished.’”Verdeja put it even more simply. “The international community has responsibility already,” he said. “Whether it’s genocide or not I think is a little bit beside the point.” The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
You can read Trump’s Israel-Palestine peace plan here,2020-01-28,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:Some experts say it’s dead on arrival.After much delay, President Trump has finally unveiled his Middle East peace plan — a plan he claims will lead to the “deal of the century.”The problem? It’s likely dead on arrival.The administration’s strategy, masterminded by Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, aims to solve the intractable problems between Israelis and Palestinians that have stymied both Democratic and Republican administrations for decades. But it essentially ignores all of the Palestinians’ desires, as the plan was drafted with no input from the Palestinian side. It’s pretty hard to make a historic deal when one side isn’t part of the negotiations.Even so, the Trump administration clearly believes its peace plan is ready for primetime and released the document with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. It’s a moment that crystallizes just how far the US has gone to align itself with Israel’s right wing under Trump, and how little the president has cared about actually crafting a serious, feasible peace deal.Here are some of the key points, as outlined by the White House:—The Vision provides for a demilitarized Palestinian state living peacefully alongside Israel, with Israel retaining security responsibility west of the Jordan River.—Over time, the Palestinians will work with United States and Israel to assume more security responsibility as Israel reduces its security footprint. —Neither Palestinians nor Israelis will be uprooted from their homes.—Israel has agreed to a four-year land freeze to secure the possibility of a two-state solution.—Jerusalem will stay united and remain the capital of Israel, while the capital of the State of Palestine will be Al-Quds and include areas of East JerusalemPalestinian refugees will be given a choice to live within the future State of Palestine, integrate into the countries where they currently live, or resettle in a third country.With little global support for Trump’s plan, it’s likely destined for the trash heap of diplomatic history.

How the Israeli settler rampage was emboldened by the new far-right government,2023-02-28,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Settlers torched a Palestinian village. What that says about Israel today.In the occupied West Bank town of Huwara on Sunday, hundreds of Israeli settlers torched the homes of 30 Palestinians and lit about 100 cars on fire.The settlers attacked in Huwara and in villages nearby hours after a Palestinian man killed two Israeli brothers from the neighboring Israeli settlement Har Bracha. The apparent retaliation injured 390 Palestinians, most from tear gas and smoke inhalation, and one Palestinian was shot dead, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Several prominent Palestinians and Israelis, including the opposition Labor Party leader Merav Michaeli, likened the attack on Huwara to a pogrom. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the settler attacks, while key members of his coalition used incendiary language against Palestinians. Then on Monday, a suspected Palestinian gunman killed an Israeli American driving on a West Bank highway.The violence in Huwara, escalating Israeli military raids on Palestinians, and the intensified Palestinian attacks against Israelis over the last several months reveal a new reality: The shape of Israeli government has moved to an extreme far right, further enabling the country’s most fringe elements and raising questions about whether more violence from either side can be avoided.Settlements, or Israeli communities that are built on land in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and that are considered illegal by the international community, have expanded over the last two decades. Today, more than 685,000 Israeli settlers live there, posing a major barrier to the creation of an independent Palestinian state.Settler violence has been surging for decades and rising in the past year. A United Nations office tracked more than 660 settler attacks on Palestinians in 2022, though watchdogs say the number may be significantly higher. “We don’t claim to have a full picture,” says Hagai El-Ad, executive director of the human rights group B’Tselem. “There’s just so much of it. And much goes unreported because it has become so routine.”These tactics against Palestinians have long been protected by the army and other institutions. Israeli authorities “failed in the investigation” of 81.5 percent of the cases since 2005, according to the Israeli human rights organization Yesh Din, and few of the investigations result in indictments of settlers. At the same time, Palestinian militant groups increased their armed resistance against Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank last year. What’s different in 2023 is that Israeli settlers are now in the government and running ministries. Their presence — in particular, that of National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who last week gained new powers over Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank — further emboldens an already powerful radical bloc of ultranationalist settlers. “It’s not a coincidence that the radical violent settlers feel more emboldened because their fellow travelers are in power,” said Khaled Elgindy, a researcher at the Middle East Institute think tank in Washington. “They don’t have to hide it anymore. They don’t have to feel defensive, they are on offense.”Earlier on Sunday, representatives of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), as well as Egypt, Jordan, and the United States, met in Aqaba, Jordan, for “frank discussions.” Israel’s and Palestine’s governments had already reportedly been holding secret talks to calm tensions, after a 48-hour period earlier last month in which a terrorist attack in East Jerusalem killed seven Israelis and an Israeli raid on the refugee camp of Jenin killed nine Palestinians.There have been no actual Israeli-Palestinian negotiations toward a Palestinian state since the end of the Obama administration and little prospect for any diplomatic progress. But in an attempt to move things along, the grouping put out a communique with eight commitments, the first being a reaffirmation of “the necessity of committing to de-escalation on the ground and to prevent further violence.” That didn’t even hold until the evening when settlers left burning wreckage across Huwara. One of Israel’s leading columnists, Nahum Barnea, compared it to Kristallnacht, the night in 1938 when Germans destroyed Jewish shops and homes in a coordinated wave of deadly hate. “Kristallnacht was relived in Huwara,” he wrote. Though the scale of the violence in the West Bank was significantly smaller than that precursor to the Holocaust and involved less overt participation from state-affiliated groups, it’s noteworthy that such a prominent centrist Israeli thinker was horrified enough to make the comparison.Decades of the Israel-Palestine peace process have sputtered out and have become inert. The Biden administration’s persistent talk about a two-state solution sounds remarkably empty and out of touch with realities on the ground. “Even in the midst of the worst violence of the Second Intifada, there was a political horizon that was to be had somewhere off in the distance,” Elgindy, who previously advised the Palestinian leadership in negotiations, told me. “You could point to constituencies in Israel on the Palestinian side, everywhere that were committed to this vision. Now that pretense is gone.”Many Palestinians do not feel represented by the aging leaders at summits like the one in Jordan on Sunday. PLO Chair Mahmoud Abbas is 87, and he hasn’t held elections since 2009. It further contributes to the disenfranchisement of Palestinians.And when there is settler violence, Palestinians have little legal recourse; it’s difficult and rare for institutions within Israel and the occupied territory to hold perpetrators of settler violence accountable. Just eight settlers who were arrested for Sunday’s rampage, for example; five were released and three are under house arrest, according to Israeli police. The United States has supported Israel in blocking United Nations Security Council resolutions and Palestinians’ attempts to take Israel to the International Criminal Court.In response to all these factors, a new militant group called Lion’s Den has emerged in the occupied West Bank. Lion’s Den, Jenin Brigades, and other resistance groups have emerged in areas where Israeli settler violence is the most severe. They have carried out attacks on settlers and Israeli soldiers. The weekend Palestinian attack on two Israeli settlers from Har Bracha wasn’t affiliated with any of these groups but reflects this growing resort to violent resistance. The violence against Palestinians more broadly across the West Bank is accelerating, as the Israeli government is also staging more intensive raids, including one near Nablus on February 22 where 11 Palestinians died and over 100 were wounded. The Israeli military has responded with near-nightly raids on suspected militant cells in the West Bank. “Many of the cases involving security forces spark serious concerns of excessive use of force and arbitrary killings,” said the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. At the same time, the extreme-right government of Netanyahu, which took office in January, is pursuing an unprecedented attack on the Israeli judiciary in an attempt to hollow out its independence. Tens of thousands of protesters have been demonstrating against what many experts view as a judicial coup. The precedent of the Israeli government trampling on the rule of law in the occupied territories for decades has created the conditions for the same to happen to the rights of Israeli Jews.“Just to take a step back, the context has always been the apartheid regime,” said Haggai Matar, the executive editor of +972, an independent news organization that publishes critical journalism from Palestinians and Israelis. “I think it’s very easy, to a degree that’s troubling, to pin so much of this on Ben Gvir or on Netanyahu.” This government does have more far-reaching plans than previous governments, with Ben Gvir and Smotrich “speaking openly about ethnic cleansing as policy,” as Matar put it. Ben Gvir is pushing for more Palestinian home demolitions, his party advocates for the annexation of the West Bank, and he even calls Palestinian lawmakers in the Knesset “terrorists” to their faces. Smotrich on Sunday shared a Twitter thread in response to the attack on the two brothers that called for the “collective punishment of the terrorist’s family.”But Matar emphasized that this government’s centrist predecessor, the Change government that was in office from 2021 to 2022, was also deeply involved in settlement construction, house demolitions, administrative detention, an increase of Palestinian deaths per annum, and a spike in settler violence. The Hawara attack is “a critical moment,” he said, but must be placed on a “continuum of increasing attacks,” such as an assault on the Palestinian village of Mufagara in 2021 or an arson attack in the West Bank city of Duma in 2015 in which a baby and his parents died.It’s both an exceptional moment and an expression of oppressive systems long in place. Update, 7 pm ET: This article has been updated to include additional information about Israel’s response to the violence in the West Bank.Correction, March 2, 10 am ET: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the two Israeli men were killed in Har Bracha.

"Israel’s humanitarian pauses in Gaza, explained",2023-11-11,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:Civilians continue to flee south as fighting around hospitals increases.Israel has agreed to four-hour daily humanitarian pauses in areas of northern Gaza, as US officials announced Thursday. The pauses, meant to allow civilians to safely leave for southern Gaza, comes amid an increasingly dire humanitarian crisis as Israel continues to bombard one of the most densely populated places on the planet. The windows have so far allowed 100,000 people to move, according to Israeli officials  —  but it’s not clear that the safe routes and pauses are enough as more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed and calls for a ceasefire grow louder.The new agreement is the result of US pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby telling reporters that the new policy is due to President Joe Biden’s “personal leadership and diplomacy.” But Biden was apparently unable to obtain the more prolonged ceasefire he sought to secure the release of hostages, Politico reported Thursday. The US continues to supply military aid to Israel, as it has for decades, and Biden has requested an additional $14.3 billion to finance the Iron Dome and other air and missile defense systems. US officials expect that the daily pauses will also allow for increased humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, as residents have received only a fraction of the basic goods via aid organizations that they did previous to the war. Israel has blockaded Gaza for the past 16 years, since Hamas took control of the territory, and food, medicine, and fuel are supplied by the United Nations and other agencies. While pauses offer some measure of safety for people fleeing Israel’s operations in northern Gaza, the totality of the humanitarian crisis there remains overwhelming. More than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces over the past month of fighting in Gaza, and supplies like food, clean water, and fuel are dangerously limited in the south, where some 2 million people are expected to shelter as Israel prosecutes its war against Hamas. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]Over the past three weeks, Israel conducted overnight raids and bombing campaigns in northern Gaza before launching a phased assault. The Israel Defense Forces announced earlier this week that they had encircled Gaza City, the densely populated northern area they have deemed the center of Hamas operations. On Friday, just a day after the humanitarian pauses were announced, fighting broke out around hospitals in Gaza City, including at al-Shifa hospital, where hundreds of gravely ill and wounded patients are being treated and thousands of civilians have been sheltering — putting them in serious danger and casting doubt on the efficacy of the humanitarian pauses.Israel initially gave the estimated 1 million people living in the northern part of the Gaza Strip 24 hours to evacuate to the south so that it could prepare to conduct military operations there, including launching airstrikes and destroying tunnels used by Hamas. The original evacuation demand, according to several humanitarian organizations including the UN, was impossible to execute, particularly given the ongoing combat, poor infrastructure damaged by previous conflict, lack of fuel for cars given the siege Israel declared on the territory starting October 9, and sheer number of people moving within one of the most densely populated places on earth. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have moved to the south since that initial call for evacuations, though thousands remain, many sheltering at hospitals like al-Shifa near Gaza City.Details about the location and time of the pauses are unclear, as is the number of days the pauses will occur, but Kirby told reporters Thursday that the timing of the pauses will be announced three hours prior to their beginning each day.Following Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s call for a siege on Gaza, aid groups as well as governments like Qatar and the US have tried to negotiate for aid to come into the territory through the Rafah crossing on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. The siege meant that no food, medicine, medical equipment, potable water, or fuel could get into the territory; electricity and, at times, telecommunications were cut as well. Without electricity or fuel, Gaza’s water desalination plants cannot produce potable water, and hospitals can operate in only limited capacities despite the critical need for health services in a war zone.Since October 9, negotiations have allowed for some aid to get through — about 100 trucks of supplies per day, according to Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues David Satterfield, compared with around 500 per day prior to the war. “Now, we understand even 150 trucks a day just meets the bare minimum to provide basic survival humanitarian assistance,” Satterfield said in a press briefing Thursday. “Much more is needed beyond that. There needs to be commercial goods restocking shelves, bakeries need to reopen with all that they need in terms of supplies, cooking gas for that purpose.” Satterfield also told reporters that fuel stores in southern and central Gaza had been made available via the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and were supplying water desalination facilities in south and central Gaza, and two water pipelines from Israel had been restored.Thus far in the fighting more than 11,000 people have been killed according to the Gaza Health Ministry; more than 4,500 are said to be children and over 3,000 women, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in a bulletin from November 10. “On average, a child is killed every 10 minutes in Gaza,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, said in a Friday briefing to the UN Security Council.IDF airstrikes and operations remain the major cause of death and casualties; though the military says it is targeting Hamas terrorists, 90 percent of the casualties are civilians when explosives are used in populated areas, according to the UN. The IDF has conducted multiple operations in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, calling it a Hamas stronghold and “hotbed of terrorist activity,” according to IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. “Nobody can claim that they didn’t know this was coming,” he said, emphasizing that residents had been told to evacuate for two weeks.On Saturday, fighting near hospitals in Gaza including al-Shifa continued, causing chaos and panic. The IDF has commanded the evacuation of al-Shifa hospital, saying that Hamas operates in tunnels beneath the facility, which both Hamas and hospital leadership deny. Al-Shifa has about 700 beds, but is currently treating 5,000 people, according to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Hamas claims the hospital is sheltering around 40,000 civilians.Reports of heavy bombardment at al-Shifa continued Friday night and into Saturday. “The situation in al-Shifa is truly catastrophic,” Ann Taylor, MSF’s head of mission in the Occupied Palestinian Territories said in a statement. “We call on the Israeli Government to cease this unrelenting assault on Gaza’s health system. Our staff and patients are inside Al-Shifa hospital where the heavy bombing has not stopped since yesterday.” MSF staff reported constant bombardment and people being shot as they tried to leave the hospital. “There is no siege, I repeat no siege, on Shifa Hospital. The east side of the hospital is open for the safe passage of Gazans who wish to leave the hospital,” IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a Saturday briefing.“We’re speaking directly and regularly with the hospital staff. The staff of Shifa Hospital has requested that tomorrow we will help the babies in the pediatric department to get to a safer hospital. We will provide the assistance needed,” Hagari said. Two babies in the neonatal unit died after the hospital ran out of fuel Saturday, according to the BBC.And though more than 850,000 people have left northern Gaza so far according to the IDF, “Hundreds of thousands of people remaining in the north are struggling to survive,” OCHA reported. “Consumption of water from unsafe sources raises serious concerns about dehydration and waterborne diseases. The World Food Programme (WFP) has expressed concern about malnutrition and starvation.”In the midst of the ongoing devastation, French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday called for a ceasefire in an interview with the BBC. “There is no other solution than first a humanitarian pause, going to a ceasefire, which will allow [us] to protect ... all civilians having nothing to do with terrorists.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The controversial phrase ""from the river to sea,"" explained",2023-11-24,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:“From the river to the sea” demands conversations about the future of Israel and Palestine.On US college campuses, on social media, and even in the halls of Congress, the 10-word slogan “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” is either a joyous call for Palestinian dignity and future statehood — or a threat to many Jewish people in Israel and around the world. The slogan rhymes both in English and in Arabic — one modern Arabic version can be transliterated as “min al-nahr ila al-bahr / Filastin satatharrar” — and the river and sea in question are the Jordan in the east and the Mediterranean in the west. The phrase has been around in various iterations for a few decades. It’s only in the past five years or so, as US public support for Palestinians among younger demographics has steadily increased, that the phrase has become a flashpoint in the political debate about the future of Israel and Palestine.Now, amid the Israel-Hamas war, the increased attention to the decades-long conflict over the land, and mass protests against Israel’s military operations in Gaza, those 10 words have suddenly become highly controversial. Historians, experts, and activists who use and study it say iterations of the phrase have had many meanings over the course of the Palestinian national struggle. Some of those sources said that in the context most people at ceasefire rallies are using it today, it likely indicates a desire for Palestinian liberation and dignity — as well as a vision for the future in which Palestinians have equal rights in their homeland. But to many Jewish people, it’s a mortal threat to the continued existence of Israel as a Jewish state.Discourse around the phrase has become so extreme that Congress’s recent censure of its only Palestinian-American member, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), was driven in no small part by her use of it. The government of Berlin has criminalized the use of the slogan as well as other pro-Palestinian symbols and actions. And after yet another endorsement of anti-semitic conspiracy theories, Elon Musk seemingly redeemed himself in the eyes of the mainstream Jewish, pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League (ADL) by condemning this phrase on Twitter. Multiple prominent Jewish organizations, including the ADL and the American Jewish Committee, have defined the phrase as inherently antisemitic because, they say, it at best denies the Jewish right to self-determination and at worst calls for ethnic cleansing against Israeli Jews.The question of whether “from the river to the sea” is offensive or a call for liberation is a “Rorschach test,” as the writer Robert Wright put it in a recent Substack post. The answer is dependent less on the phrase itself than on the speaker, the listener, and the context. But it also invites questions about what the future of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories could be, which remains unresolved 75 years after Israel was founded and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced from their homes in 1948, during the Nakba, or catastrophe.The international community and particularly the United States has called for a two-state configuration, both in previous decades and in the context of the current war. Although that seemed like a potential solution in the 1990s, that hope faded after Hamas took over Gaza in 2006 and Israel’s government moved ever further to the right. The other possibility would be a one-state solution. One version of that — in which Israel occupies Palestinian territories to varying degrees, controls people’s movement from those territories, surveils everyday activity, and controls access to basic goods — is arguably already the reality, as an April piece in Foreign Affairs argues. Another version of a singular state — the one envisioned by some activists Vox spoke to who use the “from the river to the sea” phrase — is a pluralistic, secular, democratic one in which Palestinians, Jewish Israelis, and all citizens would live in political equality. But what the future looks like now seems more critical than ever to address, as the Israel Defense Forces have killed more than 14,000 Palestinians following the October 7 massacre, in which Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants killed around 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped about 240. If Palestinians and Israelis, and more specifically their allies on both sides, can’t agree on the meaning of 10 words, what are the chances they can agree on how to peacefully and fairly govern some of the most hotly contested 10,000 square miles in the world?It’s not clear where the phrase “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” comes from, or even when it came about. Elliott Colla, a professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Georgetown University, says that the phrase as it’s currently known first came about around the time of the first intifada and the Oslo accords process in the 1990s. Other sources, though, place its origins much earlier, to the 1960s and the birth of the Palestinian nationalist movement. Earlier iterations of the slogan in Arabic included explicitly Islamist and Arab nationalist sentiments; one early version translates to “‘From the river to the sea’ ... or ‘from the water to the water, Palestine [is] Islamic,’” Colla said. “Maybe a more common version is, ‘Palestine is Arab.’” But as different political movements like pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism have fallen out of power, and other actors and movements have taken use of the slogan, the second half of the phrase has increasingly become “will be free,” especially within English-speaking solidarity circles. That reflects, typically, a vision of liberation and peace throughout the territory of historical Palestine, and more explicitly, liberation for Palestinian people living in the occupied territories. Throughout all its iterations, one of its core themes has been around the unity of the Palestinian experience of displacement and division. Palestinian Arabs living in what is now Israel, backed by other Arab nations, rejected a 1947 UN partition plan which divided the land into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem internationalized. The Jewish population understood that resolution to be their mandate to create the state of Israel, and, with British backing, fought and defeated Palestinian and Arab forces, culminating in the founding of Israel as a specifically Jewish state in 1948. Over the decades, and particularly after the 1967 war in which Israel captured the Golan Heights (originally part of Syria), Gaza (previously part of Egypt) and the West Bank (previously belonging to Jordan), as well as East Jerusalem, Israel has claimed, encroached on, or occupied the land in which Palestinians live. It has also become more difficult for Palestinians to assert a unified national identity due to political fracture within Palestinian leadership and because Palestinians living in the territories and in Israel are geographically separated and often restricted from reaching each other, thus unable to effectively organize.“The first thing to know is that it does have something to do with the history of partition. So it is articulating an image of historic Palestine undivided and unpartitioned” within the Palestinian community, Colla said. “That could be aspirational — this is a dream, all of Palestine” that is not always tied to a specific political outcome.  It’s critical to consider that the slogan is used in different ways in different contexts, whether that’s in the US and other Western countries or in the Palestinian territories themselves, though the spirit may be similar. People in the West Bank have also apparently used the Arabic translation of the phrase “to protest the Palestinian Authority, or the PA, when it compromises with Israel and when it collaborates with Israel to fragment the West Bank and Gaza,” Colla said. “It’s a protest against not just Israel and the United States but also those Palestinian leaders who have collaborated in the partition.”PA President Mahmoud Abbas is deeply unpopular within the Palestinian community and particularly in the West Bank, where he has nominally been in charge since 2005. Abbas’s leadership has brought the West Bank not increased autonomy and hope for a Palestinian state but intensive surveillance and increased Jewish Israeli settler communities. Hamas, which controls Gaza, also adopted a version of the phrase in its 2017 charter. The militant group previously called in its founding charter for the destruction of the Israeli state and killing Jewish people; though the more recent document allows for the possibility of a two-state solution according to the borders in effect prior to the 1967 war, Hamas has continued to attack Israel, most violently in the October 7 massacre. But it is this question — whether the slogan allows room for a two-state solution or is calling for a one-state solution, and if the latter, which sort of singular state — that is at the root of the debate over the phrase.In the US, pro-Israel organizations such as the American Jewish Council and the Anti-Defamation League have called the phrase antisemitic because “it calls for the establishment of a State of Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, erasing the State of Israel and its people,” according to the American Jewish Committee’s definition. The AJC also calls it “a rallying cry for terrorist groups and their sympathizers, from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) to Hamas.”It took on new meaning after Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, Holly Huffnagle, AJC’s US director for combating antisemitism, told Vox. “Antisemitism isn’t static, it’s dynamic.” (Though she insisted that “from the river to the sea” has always been antisemitic.) “We saw what ‘From the river to the sea’ looked like on October 7.”Groups including Hamas and the PLO have called for the destruction of the state of Israel in the past — meaning the end of Israel as a political entity and the expulsion of Jewish people from what is now Israeli territory. Some groups and individuals may still use the phrase this way, but it’s worth noting that that outcome just isn’t plausible in the current context, in which Israel has strong support from powerful Western countries and has military and economic strength that far outmatches anything on the Palestinian side. Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shia militia based in southern Lebanon, has also used the slogan in calling for the return of Palestine to the Palestinian people, as Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah did in a 2020 speech. “Palestine from the river to the sea is the property of the Palestinian people and they shall return to it,” Nasrallah said in the speech, adding that Jewish Israelis should leave. “Anything that has been stolen cannot become the legal property of a thief, even if the entire world recognizes its ownership.”These uses can’t be dismissed and are the basis for understandable Israeli security fears. But in the US and other countries where there have been pro-Palestinian protests and calls for ceasefire, the phrase might mean something entirely different from what it means in the West Bank or in a speech by Nasrallah.In these cases, “the text is not [just] the words, the text is the performance” of the phrase, Colla said — people singing, dancing, embracing, and raising their fists in the context of a protest are all part of that performance, and its invocation of joy and solidarity. Those protesters — members of the Palestinian diaspora and their allies — are likely embracing the possibility of Palestinian liberation and calling for the dignity and full civil rights of Palestinians in their homeland.If a two-state solution cannot be negotiated, the only plausible alternative that doesn’t perpetuate the unsustainable and unjust status quo is a democratic, secular state comprising Jewish Israelis and Palestinians and granting equal rights and political participation to all. That would, ultimately, mean the end of the state of Israel as a Jewish nation — both because the Palestinian population would be roughly equivalent to the Jewish population and in terms of national identity. Many pro-Israel activists and Jewish people consider this possibility to be painful at least and genocidal at most.But some, like Alon-Lee Green, a Jewish Israeli and one of the leaders along with Palestinian Israeli activist Sally Abed of the peace movement Standing Together, insist that this is the only way forward. As Abed put it, the Jewish state has failed both Palestinians and Jewish Israelis.“The question is, how do we create a system that provides equality and freedom for all, without the necessity of controlling millions of people militarily, without giving them rights,” Abed said. Like Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s own right-wing Likud party used a version of the slogan “from the river to the sea” in its platform, as the Associated Press reported. That platform, issued in 1977 during the height of the Palestinian armed resistance movement, denied any possibility of a two-state solution and called for only Israeli sovereignty “between the Sea and the Jordan.” In decades since, it has “traditionally supported the idea of the whole Land of Israel, even if it has not always defined the state’s borders precisely,” according to the Israel Democracy Institute. Likud under Netanyahu has opposed a two-state solution and instituted a basic law in 2018 declaring that the right of national self-determination in Israel is “unique to the Jewish people.” That further entrenched the inequality between the country’s  Jewish and Palestinian citizens, who make up about 21 percent of the population in Israel. Netanyahu’s rhetoric and that of the early Likud party echo the aims of extremist Jewish Israeli settler activists like Daniella Weiss, whom New Yorker writer Isaac Chotiner interviewed for a November story. To Weiss, the borders of “the homeland of the Jews are the Euphrates in the east and the Nile in the southwest,” which, as Chotiner notes, includes territory currently in many Middle Eastern nations, including Egypt and Iraq.In Weiss and other extremist settlers’ view, Palestinians who live in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem should accept that “We the Jews are the sovereigns in the state of Israel and in the Land of Israel,” she told Chotiner, and should not have the right to vote in the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament. Though Weiss’s views are extreme, she is a leader of a large and growing Israeli settler movement that has significant power in the government via allies like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir. In response to Israel’s increasingly right-wing government — and its war in Gaza — the slogan has become increasingly prominent in pro-Palestinian circles, and the discourse around it is increasingly fraught.“Activist groups compose and adapt and revise slogans — oftentimes they recycle old things and kind of spruce them up or change them to serve whatever the specific context is that they’re protesting,” Colla said. “So in that context, slogans are highly occasion-specific, just as protests are.”Tlaib, for example, was censured by her colleagues in Congress for her response to the war in Gaza, particularly the attack on Gaza’s al-Ahli hospital, using the phrase in a video posted to the social network X on November 3. As Vox’s Li Zhou wrote, the censure resolution accused Tlaib of ”calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.” One of the flashpoints was a slogan used in a video she shared on social media — calling for freedom “from the river to the sea” — which critics say calls for the abolition of Israel as a Jewish state and which advocates say calls for Palestinian freedom.”Tlaib explained in a following post what the slogan means to her, calling it an “aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.”Ultimately, slogans are a distraction from the conversations that matter; slogans aren’t a substitute for a political vision that actually works for the people who live in Israel and the Palestinian territories and brings sustainable peace, Green told Vox. “Slogans like ‘decolonization’ and ‘from the river to the sea,’ when they don’t say clearly, ‘Israeli-Palestinian peace, Jews and Palestinians living together,’ when they don’t take under consideration the very simple, undeniable fact that millions of Palestinians will remain on this land, and millions of Jewish people will remain on this land, and that’s the starting point for any solution,” Green said, “then you’re just working on something so theoretical, something so unconnected to our reality.” The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What unites the global protests for Palestinian rights,2023-10-25,Vox,['Li Zhou'],"Filed under:In recent weeks, tens of thousands of people have marched in rallies across the world. In light of the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, protests supporting Palestinian rights have erupted around the world in the last two weeks. The protests, which vary by country or even by city, still have some common themes: They broadly condemn Israel’s military siege of Gaza, call for a ceasefire on all sides, and criticize US military aid for Israel. They have been notable in their size and scope, with demonstrations including tens of thousands of people in the US, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. There are also some takeaways that are unique to each region: In the US, the protests appear to mark an increase in public support for Palestinians compared to past conflicts. In the Middle East, where protests have previously been repressed by multiple countries in the region like Qatar, Egypt, and Morocco, it’s revealing about autocratic leaders’ political calculuses that protests are being allowed to take place at all. Some of these protests have been condemned for supporting Hamas’s horrific violence, while other rallies and organizers have actively denounced such positions and criticized the killings of both Israeli and Palestinian civilians.In many places, the demonstrations expressing support for Palestinians share the goal of putting pressure on Israel and the Western policymakers who have thrown their support behind the Israeli government in its response to the militant political group Hamas’s October 7 attack. Separate protests in support of Israel have also been held over the past weeks, calling for the release of the roughly 200 Israeli hostages Hamas took captive during its violent incursion. Nearly two weeks ago, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, brutally killing roughly 1,400 people and seizing approximately 200, many of them civilians. In response, Israel launched an ongoing series of devastating airstrikes, and enacted a “complete siege” of Gaza, which is overseen by Hamas, keeping its roughly 2.2 million people — most of them civilians — from getting food, water, and fuel. Following external pressure, it has recently allowed in minimal humanitarian aid. Continued fighting has already caused at least 5,000 deaths and 15,200 injuries in Gaza, according to local authorities, while displacing more than 1 million people. Many activists fear the conflict could lead to significantly more casualties as the Israeli government reportedly prepares a ground invasion to target the densely populated Palestinian enclave in the coming days. This is an outbreak of violence unlike recent ones, both in terms of the brutality of Hamas’s attack and the deadly scale and stated aims of Israel’s response. The outpouring of protests criticizing this violence — particularly those condemning Israel’s military response — has also felt unique. That paradigm shift helps explain why this moment of global protest can seem different — especially to audiences in the US, watching protests abroad and in New York City, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. The US demonstrations seem to reflect shifts in public sentiment in support of Palestinian rights; for example, a March 2023 Gallup poll found for the first time that Democrats’ sympathies aligned more with Palestinians than with Israelis. Broadly, the Gallup poll found that Americans overall are still more sympathetic with Israelis, though it documented a growing trend of support for Palestinians over time. In 2010, 15 percent of Americans said their sympathies lay more with Palestinians than Israelis in the Middle East. In 2023, that number was at 31 percent.  An October 2023 Economist/YouGov survey conducted after the Hamas attacks, however, found that sympathy for Israelis grew following the militant group’s violent incursion as sympathy for Palestinians or for both groups has declined. While 31 percent of Americans were more sympathetic to Israel in March 2023, that number went up to 48 percent in October 2023 following the attacks. At the same time, an October 2023 poll from the progressive firm Data for Progress found that 66 percent of likely American voters strongly or somewhat agreed with the need for the US to call for a ceasefire. And an October 2023 Quinnipiac survey found that younger voters, in particular, were less likely to support the US’s plans to send military weapons to Israel, with 51 percent of registered voters between the ages of 18 and 34 disapproving of such actions. In many other Western countries — including France, Spain, Italy, and Britain — the public has been more sympathetic to the Palestinians’ cause than Israel’s, a dynamic reaffirmed in a 2023 YouGov survey. German respondents have sympathized more with Israelis, however, a continuation of a past pattern. In the Middle East, public sentiment has also consistently favored Palestinians, and the recent military actions in Gaza have only served to spur additional outcry. The US shift in public opinion and subsequent surge in global protests supporting Palestinians are driven by a couple of factors. In the US, the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 helped reshape conversations about racial justice, taught new leaders to mobilize, and raised broader awareness about human rights abuses. Additionally, there has been increased understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict globally due to social media and a wider range of information sources. And in recent years, there has been more scrutiny among civil rights groups of settlements in the West Bank, violence toward Palestinians in the occupied territories, and the role that US military aid is playing in this conflict. Together, these factors have contributed to a ripe environment for protest.“You do see more people, particularly in younger generations, being willing to support Palestinian rights, who equate this stance with broader stances on a number of different issues including racial justice in the US,” Sarah Parkinson, a Johns Hopkins political scientist who is an expert in Middle East studies, tells Vox. There has been a lot of variation in the protests — local political contexts, regional history, what was happening in the war the day of a rally, and even individual protest speakers can shape the message significantly. But let’s start with what many of them share: Broadly, the demonstrations in DC and globally have criticized the Biden administration’s policy choices, the Israeli government’s current airstrikes on Gaza, and the Israeli government’s longstanding occupation of Palestinian territories. “We came to make clear to President Biden that he has a choice,” Eva Borgwardt, political director of IfNotNow, a Jewish American advocacy group that opposes Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, tells Vox. IfNotNow was among the organizations that staged a sit-in on Capitol Hill last week as well as a protest in front of the White House. “Either he can uphold the value that every human life is precious or he can let Netanyahu’s far-right government enact a genocidal campaign against Palestinians that will destabilize the region and make peace an impossibility for another generation.”BREAKING: Jewish protesters for a #FreePalestine flood rotunda of Canon Building demanding CeaseFire chanting NOT IN OUR NAME!”Stop #Gazagenocide pic.twitter.com/XopVI1yEfqA chief demand that activists have is for a ceasefire, which would put a temporary halt to the military actions taken in Gaza, and center negotiations for the return of hostages that Hamas has taken. In the Middle East, activists have called for their governments to back away from the normalization of ties with Israel, which establishes open channels for diplomacy and trade, a move multiple countries have taken in the past. Beyond the immediate push for a ceasefire, some protesters are calling for longer-term policy changes including ending Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories. That push involves ending Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank and its blockade of Gaza. Many protesters who support Palestinian rights have growing concerns about the Israeli government’s actions in Gaza and in the West Bank, where it has been accused of governing Israeli settlers under one legal system and Palestinian residents under another. That, along with longtime Israeli limits on access to Gaza, has led a number of protesters and activists to accuse Israel of practicing apartheid. The Israeli and US governments have both refuted this claim.“This movement and conversation has been growing in the last few years as more and more people come to recognize the reality of the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the reality that this cannot continue,” says Liv Kunins-Berkowitz, the media coordinator at Jewish Voice for Peace, another organization that participated in protests supporting Palestinian rights and urging a ceasefire last week. Some of the protests that have occurred, like a Times Square rally promoted by the Democratic Socialists of America that took place shortly after the Hamas attack, have also been criticized for being pro-Hamas and for condoning the killings of Israeli civilians, a position that many activists have forcefully denounced. Demonstrations that occurred in Beirut and Amman following a former Hamas leader’s call for a Day of Rage were also pro-Hamas and included violent chants directed at Israel and the United States.  [Related: How the Arab World sees the Israel-Palestine conflict]Other activists in large-scale demonstrations in cities like DC have condemned the killings of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and sought to make it clear their demands relate to Palestinian civilians. “This march is not a pro-Hamas march, it’s about starving children,” Angela Braithwaite, a protester in London, told the Guardian.Domestically and internationally, ire about the conflict is also targeted at the US, which has staunchly backed Israel. “So many lawmakers have, as they should, said that the over 1,000 Israeli lives lost was an unacceptable tragedy,” says Borgwardt. “I want to ask them: How many Palestinian lives is an unacceptable tragedy? Because for some, several thousand is not enough. And they are clearly waiting to speak out until this massacre reaches unheard-of, horrifying proportions.”Throughout the Middle East, protests have taken place outside Israeli and US embassies. And in an apparent signal of the concern with the United States’ stance, Arab leaders of Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority canceled a scheduled meeting they were to hold with Biden following an explosion at a Gaza hospital that left hundreds dead. The US and Israel have since noted that intelligence points to Palestinian militants being responsible, while Hamas has blamed the Israeli military.Biden’s trip to Israel went ahead as planned last week. In a public address, he expressed his support and requested $14 billion in military aid from Congress. “We will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,” he said in remarks following the Hamas attack. Biden has begun to speak more about Palestinian civilians in recent days, saying in a national address on Thursday, “We mourn every innocent life lost. We can’t ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity.” Additionally, he has negotiated a deal that enables $100 million of humanitarian aid to move to Gaza through Egypt. This position appears to acknowledge some activists’ calls for humanitarian assistance, though it does not alter the US’s commitment to backing Israel militarily. In pushing for a ceasefire, many protesters are urging the Biden administration to reconsider its military support for Israel, which they view as contributing to mass killings of civilians in Gaza. They also question why Gaza is being given a fraction of the aid Biden requested for Israel.Political scientists note that the US’s support of Israel has harmed its image with other countries in the Middle East, including among protesters who view its stance as hypocritical. “What has particularly incensed many in the region is the rapid and extensive support that Israel received on multiple fronts — political, financial, and, most significantly, military,” says Najib Ghadbian, a University of Arkansas political scientist and expert in Middle East studies. “The sudden deployment of aircraft carriers and other weapons, along with logistical support to Israel in anticipation of a potential ground invasion of Gaza, is seen as a direct contribution to the suffering of the people in Gaza.”Younger people, as polls show, are among those most concerned with the United States’ policies toward Israel and Palestine. For some in the US, previous Black Lives Matter protests helped raise awareness about racism and discriminatory policies and mobilized people for causes related to racial justice, not just at home but globally.“I saw the parallels of Black Americans facing a militarized police force and Palestinians facing militarized policing,” says Borgwardt of her experience participating in protests following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. A shift in public opinion in 2021 “happened in part due to the George Floyd uprising,” Sam Klug, an assistant teaching professor of African American history at Loyola University Maryland, previously told Vox’s Fabiola Cineas. “This uprising, and the longer-term Black Lives Matter movement of which it was a part, influenced many Americans, especially young people, to begin viewing the situation in Israel-Palestine in terms of structural violence, occupation, and colonial oppression. Of course, it wasn’t the only cause of this shift, but it was significant.”Younger generations are also more likely to get their information from social media and from primary sources, as one expert notes. “You have, particularly with younger generations, a shift away from mainstream media outlets, which means people have access to more diverse media,” says Parkinson. “People are actually able to access voices straightforwardly and to see images direct from places like Gaza and the West Bank and East Jerusalem.”Social media and global justice movements have influenced protesters in the Middle East, as well, along with ongoing Israeli policy choices. In addition to the military strikes on Gaza, there has been coverage in the region of the Israeli government’s killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and of Israeli forces’ attacks on Palestinians at al-Aqsa Mosque in recent months, says Ghadbian. “They are united in one demand: ending the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and ending the Israeli occupation,” Kuwait University history professor Bader Al-Saif told CNN, of protesters in the Middle East. “I have not seen such a scale of protests in the region since the Arab Spring.” Protesters hope their actions can influence policymakers’ decisions in a bid to prevent more civilian deaths, and to find a longer-term resolution to this entrenched conflict. DC activists pointed to growing the support of progressive lawmakers’ resolution backing a ceasefire as a chief goal, with the aim of increasing the pressure on Biden as well. As these demonstrations have continued, the US government hasn’t altered its central policies, though the Biden administration’s approach toward the conflict does appear to be shifting slightly. While Biden said Thursday he wants Congress to approve an “unprecedented commitment to Israel’s security that will sharpen Israel’s qualitative military edge,” he also reiterated a point he made in his address in Israel, saying, “As hard as it is, we cannot give up on peace.”His language, while still bellicose, represented a tempering of the rhetoric his administration used in the days after the conflict began, such as when White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre called the initial push for a ceasefire “disgraceful.”In the Middle East, protesters want to see their governments adjust their postures toward Israel as well. In Morocco and Bahrain, demonstrations have featured calls for their countries to reverse the normalizing of ties with Israel, the New York Times reports. Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates are among the countries that have normalized relations with Israel. Saudi Arabia was also on the verge of considering such an agreement, a move that would have dealt a blow to Palestinians’ ongoing fight for an independent state, since normalization means it’s moving ahead with establishing this diplomatic relationship despite the policies Israel has implemented toward Palestinians. Saudi Arabia’s normalization would also take an incentive Israel was previously offered in exchange for negotiations with Palestinians off the table. In a rare signal of support for such demonstrations, countries like Egypt, which are more repressive toward political speech, have remained somewhat open to such protests — a move some activists view as staged and designed to increase support for domestic leaders. “One of the things that governments want to do by permitting them is to insulate themselves domestically but also to send a signal internationally that the region is really angry, with really good reason,” says Parkinson, citing Qatar as another example where government historically cracks down on this type of political speech but isn’t doing so this time around. Meanwhile, French and German leaders have restricted pro-Palestinian protests due to what their governments describe as concerns about “disorder and antisemitism,” Reuters reports, raising concerns about suppression of free speech in these countries.

Israeli forces shot a Palestinian journalist in the leg. He got no compensation.,2020-02-28,Vox,['Farah Al Sharif'],"Filed under:Israeli forces have a pattern of not compensating Palestinian journalists they injure.A Palestinian journalist shot in the leg by Israeli forces will receive no compensation for the injury, continuing a worrying trend of the Jewish state’s military facing no consequences for harming Palestinian reporters.Freelance photographer and journalist Ahmad Tal’at was covering a protest in the West Bank in 2015 when he was shot in the leg — by, he claimed, an unknown member of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). 972 Mag reports that, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf, Tal’at at the time was wearing a vest with “PRESS” printed on it as well as a helmet, and was carrying three large professional cameras, which he said made him easily recognizable as reporter. He also claimed he was shot while standing on the side of the road, accompanied by other journalists. The IDF had a different story. Its lawyers said Tal’at’s lawsuit was merely “another in a series of cases in which those who were among the rioters and those riling up the crowd to riot dare to file a lawsuit as if they are the victims,” according to 972 Mag.IDF lawyers argued that Tal’at’s injury occurred after the protest had ended, and “that even if Tal’at was wounded that day, ‘it was in the context of attacks by the rioters that endangered the security forces there,’” 972 Mag reports. 972mag translated the story and lawsuit from Hebrew to English from Israeli magazine The Seventh Eye. The judge hearing the case at a top Israeli court sided with the IDF, ruling that Tal’at would not receive compensation for his injures. The reason, per the judge, is that he was shot during an “act of war,” and thus Israel is exempt from any liability. The IDF, therefore, doesn’t have to pay Tal’at for any damages. Tal’at was seeking 40,000 Israeli shekels (about $11,600) in recompense.At first, this could seem like an isolated case. The problem is that Tal’at is the latest in a long line of Palestinian reporters that Israeli security forces have harmed or killed but failed to compensate. Security forces also rarely, if ever, face legal consequences for their actions. Even more troubling, there’s no sign that this trend will end anytime soon.Palestinian journalists frequently report abuse by Israeli security forces.In April 2018, Ahmed Abu Hussein was shot in the abdomen while covering Gaza border protests, in which demonstrators demanded the right to return to their ancestral homes in Israel. Hussein died from his wounds two weeks later.A day later, Yaser Murtaja was fatally shot in the abdomen by Israeli snipers while covering the same protest. He, like Tal’at, was wearing a vest marked clearly marked with “PRESS.” The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate in Gaza said five more Palestinian journalists covering the event were wounded.In November 2019, Muath Amarneh was blinded in one eye after Israeli Border Police opened fire to disperse protesters at a demonstration near the West Bank city of Hebron. Other journalists at the scene said Amarneh was hit by a bullet that ricocheted off a demonstrator. Again, Amarneh wore a clearly marked “PRESS” vest.Two months later, Israeli troops fractured Abdul Mohsen Shalaldeh’s skull while he reported on demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s Israel-Palestine peace plan. He feels he was targeted “as a clear message to journalists that they had to leave the field,” he told AlAraby.Clearly, there is a sustained pattern. But if Tal’at’s case is any indication, there is little hope for change or recourse.“The ruling against Tal’at is a blow to the hopes for redress of Palestinian journalists who were injured or killed because it gives full impunity to members of the IDF ... whether or not their actions are in line with the IDF’s own regulations,” Ignacio Miguel Delgado Culebras, the Middle East and North Africa representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists, told me.He also noted that he’s unaware of any cases in which Palestinian journalists received compensation for their injuries. What’s more, in many of these cases, the IDF has failed to employ nonlethal methods to deal with demonstrators while ensuring the safety of journalists. In fact, Culebras said the IDF routinely delays any investigations into its misconduct.Which means it’s more likely than not that the IDF will continue this behavior — and Palestinian reporters will continue to suffer.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."

"The Age of Aquarius is here, according to astrology TikTok",2020-12-22,Vox,['Rebecca Jennings'],"Filed under:Something strange is happening with the planets right now, and TikTok is very excited. Hello from The Goods’ twice-weekly newsletter! On Tuesdays, internet culture reporter Rebecca Jennings uses this space to update you all on what’s been going on in the world of TikTok. Is there something you want to see more of? Less of? Different of? Email rebecca.jennings@vox.com, and subscribe to The Goods’ newsletter here.Have you been having really weird dreams lately? Been moody? Feel achy? It’s not PMS (it might be PMS). It could be your body telling you that it was preparing for the Great Conjunction.Astrologers and WitchTok have been extremely jazzed about the arrival of December 21, when Jupiter and Saturn were unusually close together. The winter solstice is considered a rather spiritual occurrence in many cultures, but in 2020, it’s said to be extra important: The Great Conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn supposedly marks a shift in humanity for years to come.According to astrologer Susan Miller, the Great Conjunction “sets the tone for the ethos for the next 20 years affecting the arts, music, theatre, literature, entertainment, designer fashion, food, music, mathematics, science, politics, and the government agenda. In other words, everything!” For the past 200 years, she told Vogue, Jupiter and Saturn have met in an earth sign, but this time, they’ll meet in an air sign. “Aquarius is the humanitarian sign; you’re going to see people helping people on a grand scale,” she said.On TikTok, yesterday’s date was an even bigger deal: Some astrologers believe that we’re entering a 2,000-year Age of Aquarius, having just emerged from the Age of Pisces, which began around Jesus’s birth. If the Age of Pisces was defined by monotheism and individualism, some TikTokers say the Age of Aquarius will be about communities and humanitarianism. That would be nice! Here are some of TikTok’s other predictions for the era beginning on December 21: “mass third eye awakenings,” “huge technological innovations,” and “our 3D vibrations will transcend into 5D.” This kind of language is common in connection with New Age beliefs like healing crystals or the power of manifesting, where information is often stated as fact even though you’re likely to hear conflicting messages between believers. The 2,000-year astrological age theory, for instance, is a subject of dispute; astrologers throughout history have claimed to determine when the Age of Aquarius actually begins, and many have predicted that it will not occur for another few hundred years. Which is fine, of course — none of this is science, and part of what attracts people to astrology is choosing your own adventure.But by far the best prediction that came out of the discourse around the Great Conjunction was a tweet claiming that on December 21, Black people would be given superpowers. “On December 21 our Real DNA will be unlocked and majority will be able to do things that we thought were fiction,” the woman wrote.Then came the memes. “Black people after the December 21 update drop,” replied one user with a photo of a levitating Black man with glowing eyes. Remixes of Avengers movies proliferated, as did self-deprecating jokes like “already had the power of invisibility, ask my crush.” On TikTok, families filmed themselves getting psyched up for their superpowers, receiving the ability to teleport after presenting the proper paperwork at the DMV, and on hold with customer service with the caption “me on the 21st when nothing happens.”“As usual, Black Twitter saw something outlandish and ran with it,” explains writer (and friend of The Goods) Athena Moore. “We’re just having fun like we always do.” It’s probably the most appropriate response to sweeping claims about massively complex topics like “the future of humanity” — no one (well, except for the original tweeter) seemed to actually believe that Black people would suddenly be able to fly. Instead, the wild pronouncement was fodder for ironic yet incredibly creative jokes.On the other hand, maybe we should all be taking this Great Conjunction thing very seriously. December 21 seems to have gone fairly normally, but by the time you read this, all of our existing oppressive power structures could come crumbling down and planet earth could be radiating the “love frequency.” Can’t wait!Instead of linking out to just one really great TikTok to round out the year, here are a whole bunch of them, courtesy of my Twitter thread of my favorite videos that didn’t go super-duper viral this year (some of which were probably too inappropriate to include in this newsletter!) instagram graphics will solve the israel palestine conflict u can’t change my mind pic.twitter.com/XQAFesxeJkThe day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Don’t believe everything you see and hear about Israel and Palestine,2023-10-12,Vox,['A.W. Ohlheiser'],"Filed under:Misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war is easy to find online. Here’s how to avoid spreading it.After Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,000 and taking at least 150 hostages, and Israel declared war against Hamas and retaliated, photographs and videos of violence flooded out of the region and onto social media. Some of the images were posted by victims on the ground at the attacks. Some were reportedly seeded by Hamas, but others were years old, taken from conflict zones in other parts of the world, or even from a fictional video game. For the average internet user, knowing what information to trust online has never been more challenging. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]Complicating matters even further are the ways in which unconfirmed reports are outpacing the process of verification, finding their way into news coverage and the statements of elected officials, further fueling online falsehoods and confusion. “I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children,” President Joe Biden said last week, referring to widely circulated but as yet unconfirmed reports of Hamas militants beheading infants during the initial attack. The White House later said that Biden had not seen any such pictures and had not independently confirmed reports about the beheading.  As someone who has covered misinformation through dozens of major news events, I know that people flock to social media during a crisis for many reasons. Maybe it’s because the mainstream news doesn’t feel fast or immediate enough, or because the crisis has put them or someone close to them in harm’s way and they need help. Perhaps they want to see and share and say something that captures the reality of an important moment in time because they don’t know what else to do when the world is on fire. Misinformation and manipulation often spread for the same reasons, slipping into the feeds of those who believe it can’t hurt to share a startling video or gruesome photograph or call for aid, even if they’re not sure of the reliability of the source. When war goes online, the churn of good and bad information is supercharged by the stakes. While state-sponsored information wars existed well before the invention of the internet, social media has enabled all kinds of propaganda and dangerous falsehoods to rapidly reach millions. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, for example, livestreamers and scammers reposted old videos to TikTok, claiming they showed the latest from the front lines, in order to get views and trick people into donating to fake fundraisers. Journalists have had a difficult time following up on video-fueled updates about the situation in Gaza circulating on social media because it is extremely dangerous to be reporting in the region right now. Many news outlets have reporters working from Israel to cover the conflict. Correspondents on the ground in Gaza are trying to keep themselves and their families alive during the Israeli bombing campaign in retaliation for the Hamas attack. For example, Hamas and Israel have traded blame over a deadly hospital bombing in Gaza City. Hamas is blaming Israel, though US intelligence officials have said, based off initial intelligence, that they think Israel’s assertion that the bombing was the result of a misfired rocket from a militant group in Gaza is correct. Neither version of events has been independently confirmed. And yet, false confirmations on both sides are proliferating, whether from a random X account pretending to be a reporter or a statement from a member of Congress.  Last year, I wrote a guide to being online in wartime to help people navigate the misinformation around Russia’s war in Ukraine. A lot of the advice about how to quickly evaluate a river of online information hasn’t changed much over the years. But social media has changed quite a bit in just a few months and some of the old tricks for verifying unreliable posts need to be modified or unlearned altogether. This is particularly true on X, formerly known as Twitter, which was once a central destination for those who wanted to follow major news events in real time. Elon Musk, the platform’s owner and CTO, spent the hours after Hamas attacked Israel spreading misinformation about the conflict and even told his 150 million followers to get news on the attack from two verified accounts that have a clear history of sharing false information. Musk’s recommendation had at least 11 million views before it was deleted, according to the Washington Post. This is after Musk spent months diminishing the platform’s capacity to moderate against misinformation and hate speech. Since the initial attack, X users circulated a fabricated White House memo that claimed the US government was sending $8 billion in aid to Israel. An account posing as the Jerusalem Post fueled a false rumor that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the hospital. And because Twitter’s verification system has been repurposed into a premium badge for paying subscribers, who also get boosted engagement with their tweets, it’s now relatively easy to buy eyeballs on X and imitate expertise on the platform.Misinformation is an exhausting topic, one that’s difficult to define, and on some platforms, including X, tackling misinformation is no longer a company priority to address. So, increasingly, it’s up to you to sort through the mess. No online guide will fully protect you against the bad and untrue stuff online. But there are things you can do to navigate the online chaos that follows a major news event. Many large social media platforms have shifted back to prioritizing engagement over reliability for the posts their users see on their feeds. That has created a friendlier environment for online nonsense and coordinated disinformation. The situation is certainly made worse by the transformation of Twitter, once a useful news feed, into X, something drastically different. X is much less trustworthy and useful these days during breaking news, and evaluating sources on the platform is trickier. On X, a blue check mark once meant that the platform had verified the identity of the person or people behind the account, or that the account officially belonged to an organization. But the badge no longer serves as a verification of identity; it’s now a feature for X’s paying users, who also get better engagement and features, putting their posts in front of more people. Some verified users are also part of a program that pays them based on their engagement on X, so for them, going viral literally pays off.  Plenty of blue-checked X users have indeed been sharing misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war. Some claim to be sharing footage of the war in action when in fact they are just repurposing clips from a video game and getting millions of views. Those videos are also getting views on TikTok. TikTok has, in some ways, stepped into the role Twitter once had as the key social media app that people turn to in order to follow a major news event. The app, which many think of as an entertainment platform, is very different from Twitter in the 2010s, when it was a must-read for breaking news. While Twitter anointed its share of expert influencers, creators are the main conduit for news on TikTok. The app’s news creators build fandoms around their personalities and promise of independence from, say, mainstream sources. All that said, TikTok also has issues with misinformation.  And then there’s Telegram, one of the platforms Hamas is using to release violent footage. Telegram, which is part group chat and part social media platform, is popular globally, has few moderation practices, and has long been a home for extremists and conspiracy theorists who have left or been banned from more mainstream platforms. More on that later. The SIFT method, developed by digital literacy expert Mike Caulfield, is a good framework for learning how to evaluate emotionally charged or outrage-inducing online posts in the middle of an unfolding crisis. There are two reasons I like it: First, it’s adaptable to a lot of situations. And second, the goal here isn’t a full fact-check. SIFT is meant to be a quick series of checks that anyone can do in order to decide how much of your attention to give what you’re seeing and whether you feel comfortable sharing a post with others.  The SIFT method breaks down to four steps: “Stop, Investigate the source, Find better coverage, and Trace claims, quotes, and media to the original context.” That “Stop” step can do a lot of work during a major, violent conflict like the Israel-Hamas war. People get engagement on questionable or untrue posts during breaking news by tugging on your emotions and beliefs. So if a video, photograph, or post about the war seems to confirm everything you’ve ever believed about a topic or makes you immediately furious or hopeful or upset, stop yourself from instantly sharing it.  Then, investigate the source. This can be done pretty quickly. Click on the account sharing the thing you saw and glance at their information and previous posts. You’re not launching a full-scale investigation here. You’re just trying to get a sense of who has ended up in your feed. Next, find better coverage. That means you open up a bunch of tabs. Is this being reported anywhere else by trustworthy news sources? Has this claim been fact-checked? And finally, trace the source. Open up the news article and run a search for a phrase in the quote you’re about to share. See if you can find that image attributed elsewhere, and make sure the captions describe the same thing. During acts of unfathomable violence, videos of death and maiming circulate online with the imperative to witness. Please understand that you do not have to view violent footage circulating online in order to process a horrible event, whether you feel you can handle seeing it or not.  Check in with yourself and think critically about the role you want to play on- and offline in a moment like this. That might mean resisting the impulse to become an instant breaking news reporter in your group chat. If you don’t have the skill set to evaluate for accuracy the videos of on-the-ground footage in a neighborhood you’ve never visited, you’re not likely to develop it in a matter of minutes. I’ve tried to avoid giving specific instructions in this guide in terms of what platforms to use or not use as a regular person trying to get news. I’m going to make one now: Especially if you’re unfamiliar with Telegram, now is not the time to indulge in your curiosity and dive into the app looking for “raw” footage and live updates. In addition to the risk of encountering and engaging with literal propaganda, Telegram is notoriously bad at surfacing good information. Online falsehoods need attention and amplification to work. You might not have a big account with a ton of followers, but every reshare matters, both to the circle of people who see your posts online and to the engagement numbers for the original post. Interacting with something on social media — whether a cautious share “in case” it’s true or a repost to point out that something definitely isn’t — signals to the site’s algorithms that you’re interested in that content. In other words, outrage shares are still shares, even if you’re talking about a bad analysis, an unsourced photograph, or an outright lie.

"The long, complicated history of Black solidarity with Palestinians and Jews",2023-10-17,Vox,['Fabiola Cineas'],"Filed under:How Black support for Zionism morphed into support for Palestine.As violence and reprisals in Israel and Gaza have intensified since Hamas’s attack on October 7, reactions (or non-reactions) from Black Lives Matter and related groups in the US have come in for particular scrutiny.Black Lives Matter Chicago was heavily criticized for a since-deleted graphic that seemingly celebrated Hamas’s killing of Israelis, featuring a paraglider with the Palestinian flag, and the words “I stand with Palestine.” (The group later said it “was not proud of” the image, adding “We stand with Palestine & the people who will do what they must to live free.”) Comedian Amy Schumer reshared a video from former NBA star Amar’e Stoudemire, now an Israeli citizen, in which he criticized Black Lives Matter for its silence on Israel. “I woke up this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. That’s some coward shit. That’s cowardly,” he said. “And for all y’all Black Lives Matter [supporters] who ain’t saying nothing — ‘Well let me figure out exactly what’s happening before I say anything’ — f*** you.”In a now-deleted post on X, which was reposted more than 1,000 times, writer Daniella Greenbaum Davis wrote, “Jews marched in Selma. Jews marched for George Floyd. Jews showed up for Black Lives Matter. BLM is a disgrace. We will all still be there for you guys next time. Because that’s who we are. But now we know who you are.” Behind the uproar is a rich history of links between Black American and Palestinian activists — connections that go back to Israel’s founding but have deepened over the last decade, as activists for both issues have come to see their causes as related or even explicitly linked.In 2014, only a few weeks separated the Gaza war that year from protests over Michael Brown’s shooting in Ferguson, Missouri; Palestinians tweeted advice to the protesters on dealing with tear gas. One of the most vocal activists in Ferguson, Bassem Masri, who died in 2018, was Palestinian American. In the wake of the protests, activists traveled to occupied territories, and in 2015, Black activists and leaders publicly declared their solidarity with Palestine.By 2020, when the murder of George Floyd led to massive nationwide protests in the US, “People were painting George Floyd murals in Palestine. Palestinians were being attacked by Israeli security services, and saying, ‘I can’t breathe,’” said Sam Klug, an assistant teaching professor of African American History at Loyola University Maryland. “Over time, African Americans have looked at the Palestinian circumstance and Palestinians have also looked at what is going on in the United States.”I talked to Klug about this history — about what Black and Palestinian and Black and Jewish relations have looked like over time. We discussed what it means for allyship, protest movements, public opinion, and the future of Palestine and Israel. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Before we get into the history of Black and Palestinian solidarity, I’d like to talk about Black support for the Zionist cause, which came earlier. What’s the brief history there?That history goes back to the 19th century. Many Black nationalist thinkers and activists, people like David Walker, Martin Delany, Henry McNeal Turner, really drew a lot of inspiration from the Exodus story in the Hebrew Bible. In that story, Jews in bondage in Egypt and their resistance and eventual emancipation became a touchstone of African American politics and thought, in the struggle for abolition in the United States, and in 19th-century visions of a potential Black homeland for the African diaspora in the Americas. The idea of an oppressed people, who have been oppressed throughout the West and are seeking a homeland that has a connection to their ancestral community and establishing a political community there, is not dissimilar from a lot of Black nationalist visions of self-determination based in land for Black people. [Marcus] Garvey saw a model in the emerging Zionist movement and so did W.E.B. Du Bois, one of his main antagonists. Du Bois was quite supportive of the Zionist idea up through the establishment of the state of Israel. And then, of course, you have important connections between Jewish Americans and African Americans in the mid-century civil rights movement and the important role that Jewish Americans played in advancing that movement and providing support for it. For example, there’s the martyrdom of Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, who were killed [by the KKK] in Mississippi in 1964 after registering Black voters. But after the state of Israel was established, some Black leaders began to express dissent. Can you talk about that?The establishment of Israel in 1948 was celebrated by many corners of African American political life by organizations including the NAACP. At the time of the establishment, there was still much less awareness in African American communities of the Nakba and of the Palestinian dispossession that occurred as a result. But others began to express dissent. Interestingly, Ralph Bunche — who was an African American diplomat and the UN mediator who actually helped to negotiate the treaty between Egypt and Israel after the 1948 war — expressed a lot of reservations about how the establishment of Israel would dispossess Palestinian people. There were other dissenting voices surrounding Israel-Palestine, particularly in the Nation of Islam, which had leaders who made explicitly antisemitic statements. But there were [members], including Malcolm X, who were wrestling with the complexities of the geopolitical situation. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]During the 1956 Suez Crisis, in which Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, Nasser emerged as a crucial anti-colonial leader on the global stage since Egypt fought against Israel and its European colonial powers of Britain and France. Different corners of the African American community began to identify with Nasser as a global anti-colonial leader. Du Bois wrote a poem about Nasser, glorifying him, which signaled that he was starting to think about Israel in a different way.Then later on, when Malcolm X broke from the Nation of Islam in 1964 and traveled abroad, visiting Mecca and meeting Said Ramadan, one of the founders and leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, he articulated a consciousness of the Arabic population in historical Palestine as being dispossessed and as being a people under colonial occupation. These are important precursors to the 1967 [Six-Day] War, which is really a crucial turning point in the way that Black activists think about this. Why is the 1967 War, also known as the Six-Day War, a turning point?It’s a very short military conflict in which Israel takes the West Bank and Gaza and begins occupying those spaces within Palestine. There’s a lot going on at this time. There’s the US war in Vietnam; there’s the rise of the Black Power movement within the broader Black freedom movement in the United States. And it’s really the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, that articulates a powerful pro-Palestinian response to the 1967 War. They print in their newsletter a Palestine primer that articulates an understanding of the June 1967 War as a war of colonial occupation and identifies Palestinians as part of a global anti-colonial struggle. This is, of course, not unopposed in the African American community. Roy Wilkins at the NAACP, Bayard Rustin, one of the organizers of the March on Washington, were very critical of this statement by SNCC. But SNCC’s statement came at a time when SNCC itself was reconsidering its own role. It was starting to identify as a Black Power organization and identify African Americans as part of a global Third World. The SNCC statement sparked a shift in more radical strands of the Black Freedom Movement toward greater identification with the Palestinian cause.There was a rising understanding of racial oppression in the United States as part of a global system of hierarchy, as part of a world order founded on white supremacy. That brings about an identification with anti-imperial struggles as natural allies of the African American struggle.The analysis of the African American struggle for freedom in the United States as analogous to anti-colonial struggles abroad really reaches its apex in this moment, with not only a group like SNCC embracing this analysis related to Vietnam and Palestine, but with the emergence of the Black Panther Party, which also takes a very pro-Palestinian position with the emergence of Stokely Carmichael who also speaks out in favor of the Palestinian cause.How did the Black Power movement position itself around what was happening in the Middle East?As we move toward 1970, the Black Panther Party, under the intellectual direction of Huey Newton, began to articulate an ideology that they called intercommunalism. It essentially identified a series of communal hubs around the world engaged in struggle against a world system of white hegemony and colonial power. Palestine was an important node in that imagery. This was even evident in the imagery that the Panthers used. They used the image of Leila Khaled, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine fighter, a woman fighter carrying a gun.How did Black and Arab people in the United States make connections in their everyday lives during this period?This is a really important part of this story that gets overlooked. The Black Power movement was diverse and diffuse geographically and ideologically. But one of the most important nodes was the Detroit area because it was a center of [one of] the largest Arab American communities and the key organizations in the movement there was a series of Black caucuses within the United Auto Workers. The League of Revolutionary Black Workers worked alongside Arab American workers in these auto plants and made on-the-ground connections. Arab American workers took inspiration from Black workers caucuses and formed an Arab Workers Caucus in 1973 and then pressured their local union to divest from Israeli state bonds after the 1973 the Yom Kippur War. It seems like Black political leaders also started to make Palestine a part of their platforms around this time. [Shirley] Chisholm ran for president in 1972 and recommended direct Israeli-Arab negotiations to settle the conflict in Israel and Palestine. At that moment, that stance was not the predominant position of the Democratic Party or of American political elites more generally. She brought that perspective into the realm of presidential politics, which was an important step even though she didn’t win the nomination or the presidency. Previous presidential candidates of both parties had taken very strong pro-Israel stances. So what was happening to Black and Jewish relations in the latter part of the 20th century? How did Black communities respond to Israel during that time?Andrew Young, a former civil rights leader who was Jimmy Carter’s UN ambassador, was found out to have held a secret meeting with a representative of [Palestine Liberation Organization] in 1979. Once the press caught wind of this, Young was pressured to resign and it became an ugly conversation. The press focused on this meeting as a signal of declining Black-Jewish relations domestically. Many in the mainstream press believed that any signal of a willingness to bring forward a more pro-Palestinian standpoint in American politics was a betrayal of the historic Black Jewish alliance or of American Jews more generally. It’s important, again, to highlight that there were people in the civil rights and Black freedom movements who opposed the turn by some Black radicals toward a more pro-Palestinian posture. In 1975, Bayard Rustin along with A. Philip Randolph, formed a committee called Black Americans to Support Israel Committee (BASIC). This was geared, in part, toward refuting the turn in the Black Power Movement toward a more pro-Palestinian stance in the late ’60s and early ’70s. But it was also geared toward a sense that one way to keep the Black Jewish alliance alive is through articulating Black American support for Israel. Another connection I can’t help but think of is apartheid South Africa, which began in 1948 and didn’t end until the 1990s. How did Black Americans make connections between the Middle East, what was happening in the States, and also South Africa?Absolutely. Like the Vietnam War in the late ’60s, this other geopolitical situation really can’t be underestimated in terms of how it shaped African American views on Israel-Palestine. I think the best example of this is actually the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of Jesse Jackson. Jackson was a civil rights leader in the 1960s, a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In 1979, he led a delegation to the Middle East and met with both Israeli officials and representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, including Yasser Arafat. He pushed for direct negotiations between the United States and the PLO. In his two campaigns, especially in his 1988 one, he highlighted the ties between Israel and apartheid South Africa — the economic ties, the flow of aid — and he articulated parallels that have since become much more common between South African apartheid and Israeli treatment of Palestinians. He tried to draw attention to specific geopolitical ties between the state of Israel and apartheid South Africa. In the legacy of Chisholm, he brought these issues to the stage of a presidential campaign.The Jackson 1988 campaign was the high-water mark for pro-Palestinian support in Black politics as well as American politics. Continuing activism occurred throughout the ’90s and 2000s. After Jackson’s loss, and the channeling of a lot of conversations about Israel and Palestine into the framework of the “peace process,” it reduced the overall energy that was put into those issues.You have argued that Black Lives Matter uprisings have helped shift public opinion on Palestine. After the conflict in 2021, a Gallup poll showed that a majority of Democrats believed that the United States should put more pressure on Israel than on Palestine to find a resolution. Can you say more about this in connection to the recent violence?The shift in 2021 happened in part due to the George Floyd uprising. This uprising, and the longer-term Black Lives Matter movement of which it was a part, influenced many Americans, especially young people, to begin viewing the situation in Israel-Palestine in terms of structural violence, occupation, and colonial oppression. Of course, it wasn’t the only cause of this shift, but it was significant.It remains to be seen how public opinion, including Black public opinion, is going to respond to this October’s events, whether the horrific violence on civilians inflicted by Hamas or the astonishingly brutal Israeli assault on Gaza, which has been justified in a language that UN human rights experts and many activists are calling genocidal. Predictably, the Biden administration, most of the political class, and most mainstream media have rallied behind the Israeli state and offered relatively unqualified support for its response, even in its most violent forms. It’s hard to say where public opinion will go, but I think we are already seeing some effects of the shift in opinion that took place in 2020-21, with a number of large-scale protests against the Israeli offensive, including many led by Jewish Americans opposed to the occupation, already happening. The fact that the Black Lives Matter movement has also changed in the intervening years since 2020 will also affect its ability to mobilize and shape the conversation around these issues going forward.With all of this history you’ve recounted, why do you think people are trying to tug Black people in various directions when it comes to the latest eruption of violence?There is a long history in the United States of other groups seeking to mobilize the example of the Black freedom struggle in support of whatever their cause might be. The totemic power of the mid-century civil rights movement has formed the basis of what a lot of Americans’ understandings of what fights against oppression are and should be in all times and places. One of the unfortunate consequences of that has been that white Americans and Americans fighting for all sorts of different causes then believe that they can lay claim to that struggle, and believe that if Black people in the present are not supporting their positions or what they view as their righteous struggle against some form of oppression or another, that Black people in the present are betraying the legacy of that totemic mid-century civil rights struggle. A lot of this has to do with the way the historical memory of the mid-20th century civil rights movement has been mobilized. This is connected to anti-Blackness in the sense that it presumes that Black people in the present day should or must act in a certain way. And you see that in how anger is directed at Black Americans maybe more so than other Americans for the positions they are or are not taking related to any number of issues and today the issue is what’s going on in Israel and Palestine.There’s a sense in this moment that people are keeping some kind of score when it comes to allyship and solidarity. It seems like people are ignoring various atrocities based on allegiances. I think there is something that is a little disturbing about the premise of “we were there for you so you must be there for us.” Historian Robin D. G. Kelley has this great line: “Solidarity is not a market exchange.” I feel like that really applies to this moment and to a lot of these questions.

"Trump’s Israel-Palestine ""peace plan"" is a con",2020-01-28,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:The proposal destroys the prospects for any real deal and brings Israel meaningfully closer to “apartheid.”Donald Trump’s “peace plan” isn’t a plan for advancing Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. It’s a plan for scuttling them. The president released the long-awaited political framework of his “Peace to Prosperity” plan on Tuesday afternoon after a White House ceremony featuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The proposal is missing a signature feature of every prior peace plan: a path to a viable Palestinian state. It divides up the Palestinian territories and surrounds them by Israel, and gives Israel total control over Palestinian security — allowing a future Palestinian government to exercise full control over its own land only when Israel deems it acceptable. It’s a kind of state-minus: a Palestine without much of its land and subservient to Israel for basic functions.“Trump can try to make this a Palestinian state by calling it a state. But it ain’t ever gonna whistle,” writes Tamara Cofman Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Middle East Policy. Needless to say, the Palestinians cannot and will not agree to such humiliation, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has already ruled it out.“No, no, and no,” he has said. “Jerusalem is not for sale. All of our rights are not for sale or bartering.”In fact, the Palestinians didn’t even have a role in writing the plan: It was put together primarily by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, in consultation with the Israeli government. The notion that this is a good-faith effort to make peace is laughable. So if the “peace plan” isn’t a peace plan, then what is it?First, it’s an effort to help Netanyahu, a staunch Trump ally, in advance of tightly contested March elections in Israel. The release of a plan so tilted to Israeli priorities helps the right-wing prime minister sell himself as the man best positioned to handle the vital US-Israel relationship. And it doesn’t seem like an accident that the plan was released on the same day that Israel’s attorney general formally indicted Netanyahu on bribery and corruption charges.Second, and more insidiously, it is a plan to legitimize Israel’s ongoing effort to seize additional Palestinian land. The United States, as Israel’s most important ally and the historic mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, helps define the parameters of what counts as an acceptable outcome. As soon as the Palestinians have rejected the plan — and it took only minutes for them to do so — the Israelis can say, “Well, we tried, but they wouldn’t deal.” And they can proceed with settlement expansion and land grabs, moving Israel toward “not peace, but apartheid,” as B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights group, put it in a press release on the proposal.The Trump vision is, in short, a truly Orwellian creation: a “peace plan” that actually is a plan to destroy the prospects for peace.Prior to the Trump plan, the basic framework for Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations had been relatively fixed. There would be two states, with the Palestinians taking control of the overwhelming bulk of the Palestinian-populated West Bank and Gaza Strip, and with Israel largely retreating to its current internationally recognized borders. The two sides would come to agreement on thorny issues like which Israeli settlements in the West Bank could become part of Israel, and how exactly to share Jerusalem (a holy city for Judaism and Islam that both sides claim as their capital).The Trump plan pretty much throws out this framework entirely.Instead of allowing the two sides to negotiate solutions to these core disagreements, the plan lays out a detailed vision for final terms before negotiations have even begun. On each of the four main issues — West Bank borders/settlements, Jerusalem, justice for Palestinian refugees displaced in the 1948 war, and balancing Israel’s security needs with Palestinian sovereignty — the plan is heavily tilted in Israel’s direction. “Palestinians are being offered no state at all, just the box a state came in,” writes Hussein Ibish, the senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute. “Israel will be left in complete control of the entire area from the river to the sea. Pure apartheid.”Perhaps the easiest way to see why is to look at the plan’s map for what final borders would look like. The proposed Palestinian state is in green; the little dots in the middle of the West Bank are Israeli “enclaves” that will remain part of Israel:What you see is a Palestinian “state” that covers Gaza and a fraction of the West Bank, is surrounded by Israel, and is cut up even further by Israeli land. The plan seems to permit Israel beginning the process of annexing part of this land, starting with the Jordan Valley in the eastern part of the West Bank, an area that would cut off Palestinians from neighboring Jordan.And the drawing actually understates how bad things will be, because it’s simply too zoomed out to illustrate how many different Israeli settlements there are and how much they’d screw up Palestinian development. This map alone would render the entire plan unacceptable to Palestinians. “For the first time, the United States has unveiled a map with precise borders, and an Israeli leader has endorsed it. That map is a maximal vision of Israeli territorial control in the West Bank and Jerusalem,” Michael Koplow, the policy director of the Israel Policy Forum, writes in the Forward.But it’s also terrible for Palestinians on the other three main contentious issues.The plan states that “Jerusalem will remain the sovereign capital of the State of Israel, and it should remain an undivided city.” The Palestinians will be granted only a tiny fraction of the heavily Palestinian-populated part of the city known as East Jerusalem that excludes the religious holy sites; “all of Jerusalem’s holy sites should be subject to the same governance regimes that exist today,” as the plan euphemistically puts it.On refugees, the Palestinians literally get nothing — just a vague promise that some money might come up.“Proposals that demand that the State of Israel agree to take in Palestinian refugees, or that promise tens of billions of dollars in compensation for the refugees, have never been realistic and a credible funding source has never been identified,” the plan explains. “Nevertheless, we will endeavor to raise a fund to provide some compensation to Palestinian refugees.”Yet it is the security section that is perhaps most revealing. Not only would the future state of Palestine not be permitted to develop its own “military or paramilitary” forces — ever — but Israel would also maintain full security control over Palestinian territory until it decides not to. And if at any time Israel changes its mind, it is within its rights under the deal to retake military control.“Once the State of Israel determines that the State of Palestine has demonstrated both a clear intention and a sustained capacity to fight terrorism, a pilot program will be initiated in an area of the West Bank portion of the State of Palestine, designated by the State of Israel, to determine if the State of Palestine is able to meet the Security Criteria,” the plan explains. “Should the State of Palestine fail to meet all or any of the Security Criteria at any time, the State of Israel will have the right to reverse the process outlined above.”A peace plan is supposed to end Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank. By giving Israel full control, the Trump plan makes such a withdrawal nearly impossible to envision.“If you put it in Israel’s hands it will never happen,” writes Ilan Goldenberg, the Middle East security director at the Center for a New American Security. “It’s a recipe for permanent occupation.”Given these harsh terms and the total lack of Palestinian buy-in, there is no plausible reason to believe this plan could ever serve as the basis of an actual peace agreement for the two sides. So what’s the purpose of releasing it with all this fanfare?Part of the explanation is purely political: Trump wants to help his friend Netanyahu seem strong before Israel’s elections. The timing of the plan’s release makes this relatively transparent.But the Trump administration wouldn’t go through all the trouble of drafting a plan just to interfere in a foreign election. There’s a deeper, even likelier explanation: that the right-wingers who make up Trump’s Israel-Palestine team have worked with the Israeli right to figure out a way to undo the peace process itself.Israeli politics has tilted heavily against peace negotiations in the past two decades, largely as a result of the collapse of the 1990s-era peace process into the violence of the second intifada. The March elections are primarily a contest between Netanyahu and the center-right Blue and White party, which itself has endorsed the idea of annexing part of the West Bank — and celebrated the release of Trump’s plan as providing “a strong, viable basis for advancing a peace accord with the Palestinian.”Consider the likely effect of this plan’s release on Israeli politics in this context. The Israel Policy Forum’s Koplow does a good job outlining it:Israeli expectations have been permanently reset, and the trajectory of the Israeli position moving closer to the Palestinian one with each successive round of talks is over. Trump has destroyed any remaining hope that Israel will settle for the deal that peace processers have envisioned for a quarter century. In fact, Trump’s vision is weighted so far in one direction that it makes any deal at all hard to envision, particularly if Israel actually goes through with the annexation scenario that Trump has now greenlit.Not only will Israeli leaders be hard-pressed to accept less than what Trump offered, the inevitable Palestinian rejection of Trump’s plan will give them the opportunity to start taking land on their own. The Israeli argument since Oslo has always been: “We tried to negotiate, but the Palestinians wouldn’t listen.” They’ll be able to say that this time around too, even though the negotiations were never offered in good faith.What’s more, they can use the plan’s huge territorial concession — that Israel will get to keep its West Bank settlements permanently — as a justification for annexing at least part of it unilaterally. Netanyahu had vowed to annex the Jordan Valley prior to the plan’s release; Israel’s cabinet appears set to start the annexation effort as early as Sunday.Such a land grab would force Israel down one of two dangerous one-state paths.Option one would be to give the vote to Palestinians and make them full citizens of Israel, leading to an Arab demographic majority and thus ending Israel’s status as a Jewish state. This is not only a recipe for violence between Muslims and Jews but also unacceptable to Israel’s current leadership, who care much more about the state’s Jewish character than its democratic one.The other option is indefinite Israeli rule over Palestinians without granting them citizenship. There’s a word for keeping an ethnically defined part of your population in permanent second-class citizenship: apartheid.And that is the most fundamental effect of the Trump plan: to grant legitimacy to the move toward apartheid, to give America’s imprimatur to something its government once saw as impermissible.They are destroying any prospect for a just peace plan in the name of saving it.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The world has moved on from Colleyville. American Jews can’t.,2022-01-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:The siege on the Beth Israel synagogue reflects a scary new normal.When an armed man stormed a Texas synagogue on Saturday, taking a rabbi and three worshippers hostage, it seemed fairly obvious that the victims’ identity had something to do with the attack. But in a press conference after all four hostages escaped Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, FBI special agent Matthew DeSarno seemed to deny that, telling reporters the attack’s motive was “not specifically related to the Jewish community.”DeSarno was attempting to communicate that the hostage taker’s core demand — the release of imprisoned jihadist Aafia Siddiqui — wasn’t about Jews. But interviews with the hostages themselves revealed a clear connection: Their captor believed that a Jewish conspiracy ruled America and that, if he took Jews hostage, he could compel the US to release Siddiqui.“He terrorized us because he believed these anti-Semitic tropes that the Jews control everything, and if I go to the Jews, they can pull the strings,” hostage Jeffrey Cohen told CNN. “He even said at one point that ‘I’m coming to you because I know President Biden will do things for the Jews.’”Perhaps DeSarno wasn’t aware of this when he made his comments, which the FBI has since walked back. But major media outlets ran with his line, blaring headlines that downplayed the anti-Semitism at the core of the attack. It was as though the attacker had chosen Beth Israel at random, rather than targeted a Jewish community near where Siddiqui was imprisoned.The coverage only underscored a creeping sentiment that spread among us last weekend. Many Jews, myself included, already felt like few were paying attention to the crisis in Colleyville as it unfolded over the weekend; that we Jews were rocked by a collective trauma while most Americans watched the NFL playoffs.This is not a new feeling.In the past several years, American Jews have been subject to a wave of violence nearly unprecedented in post-Holocaust America. If these anti-Semitic incidents garner significant mainstream attention — a big if — attention to them seems to fade rapidly, erased by a fast-moving news cycle. The root causes of rising anti-Semitism are often ignored, especially when politically inconvenient to one side or the other.There are always exceptions: In the wake of the Colleyville attack, for example, many Muslims have been particularly vocal allies. But for the most part, the world has moved on. American Jews, on the other hand, cannot — for good reason.Let’s recount what the past few years have been like for American Jews.In August 2017, the torch-carrying marchers at Charlottesville chanted, “Jews will not replace us,” as they rallied to protect Confederate iconography. Armed individuals dressed in fatigues menaced a local synagogue — also named Beth Israel — while neo-Nazis yelled, “Sieg heil!” as they passed by.In October 2018, we saw the deadliest mass killing of Jews in American history: the assault on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, which claimed 11 Jewish lives. The far-right shooter believed that Jews were responsible for mass nonwhite immigration and wanted to kill as many as he could find in retaliation.In April 2019, another far-right shooter preoccupied by fears of a Jewish-perpetrated “white genocide” attacked the Chabad synagogue in Poway, California, killing one and injuring three.In December 2019, New York and New Jersey — the epicenter of American Jewry — were swept by a wave of anti-Semitic violence.Two extremist members of the Black Hebrew Israelite church, a fringe religion that believes they are the true Jews and we are impostors, killed a police officer and three shoppers at a kosher market in Jersey City. A man wielding a machete attacked a Hanukkah party at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, New York, killing one and injuring four. Orthodox Jews in New York were subject to a wave of street assaults and beatings.In May 2021, the conflict between Israel and Hamas led to yet another spike in anti-Semitic violence, including high-profile attacks perpetrated by individuals who blamed American Jews for Israel’s actions. In Los Angeles, for example, a group of men drove to a heavily Jewish neighborhood and assaulted diners at a sushi restaurant. The attackers were waving Palestinian flags and chanting, “Free Palestine!”This sort of violence is certainly not the norm. In absolute terms, most American Jews are still quite unlikely to be targeted by anti-Semitic attacks. But both quantitative and anecdotal data suggest that there has been a sustained rise in anti-Semitic activity. The following chart shows data on anti-Semitic incidents of all kinds, ranging from murders to harassment, from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish anti-hate watchdog. The ADL data, while not perfect, is one of the better sources of information on the topic — and it shows a spike in the past several years.The explanation among scholars and experts for this rise tends to focus on Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy and the concomitant rise of the alt-right.In this telling, Trump’s ascendance shifted the Overton window for the far right, leading to a rise in anti-Semitic harassment and violence. (Trump himself repeatedly made anti-Semitic comments despite having Jewish family.) Recent academic research finds that, in the United States, anti-Semitic beliefs are more prevalent on the right.The attacks in Pittsburgh and Poway suggest this diagnosis is in large part correct. But the past few years of anti-Semitic violence demonstrate clearly that it’s not the full story.The Colleyville siege seems to have been perpetrated by a British Islamist. The 2021 attacks seem to have emerged out of anti-Israel sentiment, a cause more associated with the left. The 2019 violence in New York and New Jersey doesn’t really connect to politics as we typically understand it, emerging in part out of a radical subsection of the already-small Black Hebrew Israelite group and local tensions between Black and Jewish residents in Brooklyn.What this illustrates, more than anything else, is the protean and primordial nature of anti-Semitism — a prejudice and belief structure so baked into Western society that it has a remarkable capacity to infuse newer ideas and reassert itself in different forms. Today, we are seeing the rise not of one form of anti-Semitism but of multiple anti-Semitisms — each popular with different segments of the population for different reasons, but also capable of reinforcing each other by normalizing anti-Semitic expression.There is no mistaking the consequences for Jews. In a 2021 survey from the American Jewish Committee, a leading Jewish communal group, 24 percent of American Jews reported that an institution they were affiliated with had been targeted by anti-Semitism in the past five years. Ninety percent said anti-Semitism was a problem in America today, and 82 percent agreed that anti-Semitism had increased in the past five years.Synagogues have had to increase security spending, straining often tight budgets that could be spent on programming for their congregants. Measures include hiring more armed guards to patrol services, setting up security camera systems, and providing active shooter training for rabbis and Hebrew school teachers.Some of this is familiar; there have been armed guards at my synagogue as long as I can remember. But much of the urgency is new. For a community that has long seen America as our haven, a place different in kind from the Europe so many Jews were driven out of, it’s a profoundly unsettling feeling.Dara Horn, a novelist and scholar of Yiddish literature, spent 20 years avoiding the topic of anti-Semitism. She wanted to write about Jewish life rather than Jewish death.But the past few years changed things. In 2021, Horn published a book titled People Love Dead Jews, an examination of the role that Jewish suffering plays in the public imagination. Her analysis is not flattering.“People tell stories about dead Jews so they can feel better about themselves,” Horn tells me. “Those stories often require the erasure of actual Jews, because actual Jews would ruin the story.”One of the more provocative examples she mentioned is the oft-repeated poem, attributed to German pastor Martin Niemöller, citing attacks on Jews as one of several canaries in the coal mine for political catastrophe. You’ve probably heard this version of it, or at least seen it on a Facebook post:First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—   Because I was not a socialist.Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—   Because I was not a trade unionist.Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—   Because I was not a Jew.Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for meIn theory, the message is one of solidarity: What happens to Jews should be of concern to all of us. But Horn argues that there’s a worrying implication to this message, one that instrumentalizes Jews rather than centering us.“What you’re basically saying is that we should all care when Jews are murdered and attacked because it might be an ominous sign that ‘real people’ might be attacked later,” Horn tells me. “I get that that’s not what it’s trying to say, but it plays into this idea that Jews are just this symbol that you can use for whatever purpose you need.”In American political discourse, anti-Semitism often gets treated in exactly the way Horn fears: as a tool to be wielded, rather than a problem for living, breathing Jewish people. Among conservatives, support for Israel becomes equated with support for Jews — to the point where actual anti-Semitism emanating from pro-Israel politicians, from Donald Trump to Marjorie Taylor Greene, is treated as unimportant or excusable. The Jewish experience becomes flattened into a narrative of “Judeo-Christian” culture under shared threat from Islamist terrorism, eliding the ways in which America’s mostly liberal Jewish population feels threatened by the influence of political Christianity on the right.Colleyville is already being deployed in this fashion. In a public letter, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) turned an attack on Jews into an attack on admitting Afghan refugees.“I write with alarm over reports that the Islamic terrorist who took hostages at a Jewish synagogue in Texas this past weekend was granted a travel visa,” Hawley claims. “This failure comes in the wake of the Biden Administration’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and failure to vet the tens of thousands who were evacuated to our country.” Never mind that the attacker came from Britain, not Afghanistan. Never mind that he was not a refugee. Never mind that Jews are some of the staunchest supporters of refugee admittance in the country, owing to our own experiences as refugees after the Holocaust. There are also problems like this on the left, albeit less common among mainstream political figures.Incidents of anti-Semitic violence are mourned and then swiftly deployed in partisan politics, turned into a brief against MAGA America, rather than serving as an opportunity to confront the way many progressives fail to take anti-Semitism seriously as a form of structural oppression. Similarly, Jewish concerns about anti-Israel rhetoric crossing the line into anti-Semitism are ignored or even dismissed as smear jobs. I have had brutal, sometimes even angry conversations with progressive friends and acquaintances on this very topic.The throughline here is that Jews don’t own their stories; that anti-Semitism means what others want it to mean. And that’s when people pay attention to anti-Semitism at all, which they often do not — except for the few days after incidents like Colleyville. A common refrain from Jews I know during and after the Colleyville standoff was a sense of total alienation, that they were glued to their phones and TVs while most others had no idea that American Jews were in crisis. It wasn’t that we had been made into object lessons for others, at least not yet; it was that our suffering was barely worth noticing.What American Jews need from mainstream American society right now is to be listened to, for our fears about rising anti-Semitism to be heard and, once heard, taken seriously on their own terms. This does not require the false assumption of a monolithic Jewish community, where all of us agree on how to tackle anti-Semitism. What it does require is a mental reorientation among America’s non-Jews: a willingness to reckon with the fact that anti-Semitism remains a meaningful force in American society, one that requires a response both unfamiliar and politically uncomfortable.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
There’s no Jewish American consensus about the conflict in Israel and Gaza,2023-10-13,Vox,['Marin Cogan'],"Filed under:Attitudes toward Israel were already changing. The unfolding violence is making it even more complicated.When the terror attacks unfolded this weekend in Israel, the first instinct of many Jewish Americans was to reach out to family and friends. Israel is a small country — you can drive from the top to the bottom in under six hours — but it is home to one of the world’s largest communities of Jews, who make up just 0.2 percent of the global population. The other largest Jewish population lives in the United States, and connections between the two groups run deep. Many Jewish Americans have relatives and loved ones who live in Israel, where, due to the small population and scale of the deaths — 1,200 Israelis were killed, thousands more were wounded — nearly everyone knows someone affected, directly or indirectly, by the violence. This week will almost certainly be remembered by Jewish Americans as one of the most difficult in our collective modern memory. There is the primary grief, over the loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives, and the terrible knowledge that, with Israel waging a counterattack on Gaza, these deaths will continue: As of early Friday morning, more than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed, including 500 children, and around 6,600 people are injured. Israel has ordered an evacuation of more than 1 million people living in the northern half of the strip, a move the United Nation said would have “devastating humanitarian consequences.” American Jews are not a monolith — “two Jews, three opinions” goes the old adage. We are a tight-knit but diverse community, made up of people from different races, denominations, and political beliefs. We are used to finding comfort and support in each other. Even so, we are also discovering how deeply isolating this moment can feel, as we struggle to make sense of a rapidly unfolding tragedy, our own sense of loss, and how that heartbreak is being received by the outside world. None of this is happening in a vacuum. It’s coming amid seismic shifts in politics and public opinion, during a right-wing turn in Israel’s government and an ever-longer violent occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, as well as broader generational changes, with a younger generation of Jewish Americans who are more progressive and more willing to be critical of Israel. It’s happening at a time of rising antisemitic violence in the United States and around the world. On Friday, after a former Hamas leader urged global protests, which some interpreted as a “day of jihad,” many Jewish schools and temples either closed or stepped up security in recognition of the increase in antisemitic hate crimes over the last several years.It would be impossible to capture these dynamics perfectly while so much is in flux. Still, it’s worth understanding some of the major changes taking place culturally and politically, and the complicated questions they raise for American Jews in an already cataclysmic moment.American Jews, who make up 2.4 percent of the overall electorate, are a solidly liberal group and have long been one of the Democratic Party’s core constituencies. According to a survey released by Pew Research Center in 2020, 71 percent of Jews identified as or leaned Democratic. A 2019 survey of Gallup polling data noted that Jews are the most liberal-leaning religious group in the United States. American Jews overwhelmingly disapproved of Donald Trump’s presidency, even as he courted and won over more politically conservative, religiously observant Orthodox Jews with his uncritical embrace of Israel’s leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Recent surveys showed American Jews in strong support of President Joe Biden; in an April 2022 survey by the Jewish Electorate Institute, the president had a 63 percent approval rating among Jewish voters, 21 points higher than his approval rating among the general public. Since the founding of Israel in 1948, the leadership of both major political parties has, like the majority of American Jews, maintained strong support for the state of Israel. In the past few years, though, Democrats have been evolving in their views on the conflict between Israel and Palestine.A Gallup poll released in April 2023 clocked this important change: For the first time in the pollster’s history of asking the question, Democrats expressed more sympathy for Palestinians than they did for Israelis, with 49 percent saying they sympathized more with Palestinians, compared to 38 percent who sympathized with Israelis. (Republicans continued to say they overwhelmingly sympathized with Israel.)Gallup noted “an 11-percentage-point increase over the past year in Democrats’ sympathy with the Palestinians,” with the most movement on the issue coming in the last five years. It’s also worth noting that while a majority of Republicans and Democrats said they had a favorable view of Israel as a country, the number was much lower among Democrats (56 percent) than among Republicans (82 percent). This shift coincides with the Israeli government, primarily under Netanyahu, moving so far to the right in recent years that it has become difficult, if not impossible, for Jewish liberals to defend its actions.  An Israeli military attack on Gaza in 2008, following rocket attacks by Hamas, killed 1,400 Palestinians, including hundreds of children, and drew condemnation from organizations like Amnesty International. In 2014, an Israeli invasion of Gaza following the murder of three Israeli teens killed more than 2,300 Palestinians, the most in any single year since 1967. In each instance, Israel’s greater military power created a death toll that was far higher for Palestinians than for Israelis.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]In the Trump era, Israeli leaders found an ally that was supportive of an increasingly right-wing government, enabling settlers in the West Bank and creating a powder keg where fighting frequently broke out between Israelis and Palestinians. In 2021, clashes between the two led to more deaths on both sides, again disproportionately Palestinian. This year, tensions continued to mount, with Israeli settlers terrorizing Palestinian civilians and setting fire to their homes. Official US policy toward Israel has remained steadfast and relatively unchanged through it all. The international community, however, and many on the American left, have taken notice. “There is no other way to define the regime that Israel has imposed on the Palestinians — which is apartheid by default — other than an open-air prison,” a United Nations expert told reporters last year, using a phrase that has come to define international understanding of the conditions in Gaza that preceded the current conflict. Young American Jews are moving in different directions than their elders. While a growing share of young Jews identify as Orthodox, an even larger share say they have no religious affiliation, part of a growing trend of young people who are less religious than older generations. The data shows a strong correlation between religiosity and support for the state of Israel. As Frank Newport, a Gallup senior scientist, puts it: “Highly religious Americans continue to be much more sympathetic toward Israel than those who are less religious.”  Overall, Jewish Americans tend to have more favorable views of Israel than the general public, setting Jewish American Democrats apart from the rest of their party. This cohort of younger Jews is less likely to feel an emotional attachment to Israel than their elders, though. They are also more likely to be critical of it.When pollsters working for the Jewish Electorate Institute asked specific questions about Israel and Palestine to 800 Jewish American voters in 2021, what they found shocked some Jewish leaders. Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they supported restricting US military aid to Israel so that it could not spend the money on expanding settlements in the West Bank. Roughly a quarter of those surveyed said they agreed with the statement “Israel is an apartheid state.” And 31 percent said that Israel was “committing genocide” against the Palestinians. Younger Jews were much more likely to agree with both statements.“I’m just speechless and horrified,” a Dartmouth professor of Jewish studies told the Forward, a Jewish newspaper, when the survey results were released. “It breaks my heart and it comes like a tornado hitting me in the face.” The results showed that the divergence in opinion exists not just between American Jews and Democrats, but within the American Jewish community itself.Those divisions are growing in the context of a resurgent progressive movement. Awareness of the plight of the Palestinians in the United States has grown with the rise of an ascendent social justice movement, one centered primarily on Black Lives Matter. Leaders of BLM groups have connected their movement to the cause of Palestinian liberation, invoking historical analogies about settler colonialism as a means of comparison.As they did in the civil rights era, Jewish Americans are playing an important role in today’s social justice movement. There are Jewish organizations supporting racial and economic justice, defending the rights of immigrants and refugees, and fighting for reproductive rights. Today, too, Jewish organizations are among the leading voices arguing for an end to Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and urging US political leadership to limit American aid to Israel in order to achieve those goals.These Jewish organizations are united by a strong sense of Jewish identity that derives less from religious traditions than from cultural ones. They connect their activism to the Jewish concept of tikkun olam — repairing the world. That sense of duty is strengthened by the notion that, as the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, our existence is a privilege and Jewish Americans are duty-bound to protect the vulnerable. That framework is now guiding the vocal protests from American Jews who are calling for an end to the Israeli assault on Gaza.“Our tradition teaches us that pikuach nefesh — saving a life — takes precedence over all other commandments,” Never Again Action, a Jewish and immigrant-led group opposing the detention and deportation of immigrants, posted in a statement this week. “Nothing is more precious than human life.”In 2017, when white supremacists marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting “Jews will not replace us,” it was a reminder that the threat of right-wing antisemitism remains very real in the United States. A year later, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a gunman entered a synagogue and murdered 11 people, including Holocaust survivors, in what was the deadliest antisemitic attack ever committed on American soil. There have been too many other incidents — some small, and some not — to count, at a time when prominent cultural figures are embracing anti-Jewish sentiment and growing violence at home and abroad.Each of those moments were deeply painful for the Jewish American community. So were the immediate reactions to the attacks on Israeli civilians from some on the American left who were dismissive or even celebratory in the face of news that war crimes were committed against Israeli civilians. It raised new, painful questions for American Jews about who their allies are, where they fit within the broader political landscape, and where they stand now as the conflict unfolds. Many Jewish Americans have recommitted to their support for Israel in the wake of Hamas’s terrorist attacks and hostage-takings. Others are expressing their opposition to the war and urging political leaders not to let the murders escalate into more violence.“Over the weekend,” writes Arielle Angel, editor-in-chief of the left-wing magazine Jewish Currents, many Jews against the occupation “found they could not join [Palestinian] solidarity protests because they needed something the protests could not provide: a space to grieve the Israeli dead, to struggle with their own place in the coming political process.”“It is a situation none of us have ever before confronted in earnest,” she continues, “amid a long history of vastly disproportionate death tolls. And now, when we need it most, we find ourselves struggling with a lack of emotional and political vocabulary.” Angel is right. No one — not even the most astute observers — can say where this ends. The only guarantee, at this point, appears to be more devastation.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Here’s what UNESCO is — and why the Trump administration just quit it,2017-10-12,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:“It’s as if a couple who had been living apart for years finally agreed to a divorce.”Thursday morning, Americans woke up to some news that felt like it was out of left field: The Trump administration was withdrawing the United States from membership in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This seemed strange because UNESCO is such an inoffensive-seeming organization: Its most prominent function is designating and protecting official international landmarks, called World Heritage Sites — places like The Alamo and the Great Barrier Reef. What possible reason could the US have for quitting an organization devoted to culture and science?The reality, though, is bit a more complex, as the US and UNESCO have actually been at loggerheads since 2011. The key issue, as with many US-UN disputes, is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In October 2011, UNESCO admitted the Palestinian territories to the organization as an independent member-state called Palestine. This triggered a US law which cut off American funding for any organization that recognized an independent Palestine. The US had previously paid for 22 percent ($80 million) of UNESCO’s annual budget. Finally, in 2013, after the US missed several rounds of payments to UNESCO, the organization suspended US voting rights in its core decision-making bodies. So the US hasn’t been a real UNESCO member for a while. Trump is just making that status official — and scoring a domestic public relations coup with pro-Israel, anti-UN conservatives in the process.“It’s as if a couple who had been living apart for years finally agreed to a divorce,” says Richard Gowan, a scholar at the European Council on Foreign Relations who studies the UN.While most famous for designating various places World Heritage Sites, UNESCO also sponsors a range of international cultural and intellectual activities. “A lot of UNESCO's work is quite pointless,” Gowan tells me. “But it also runs an odd array of worthwhile programs on issues ranging from education to tsunami warning.”Some of these things, like supporting international Holocaust education, are really important. But the organization isn’t nearly as prominent or geopolitically significant as the UN Security Council, which sets binding international law, or UN Peacekeeping, a body literally tasked with helping war-torn countries transition to peace. That makes UNESCO a natural venue for countries that want to engage in ideological grandstanding and symbolic protest votes without actually causing too much chaos in the international system.For instance, in 1984, the Reagan administration took out its frustration with the UN on UNESCO over accusations of anti-US, pro-Soviet bias at the UN (it took until 2002 for the US to rejoin). It’s also why the Palestinians, frustrated with the failure of US-sponsored negotiations to produce a peace agreement, pushed to be recognized as a UNESCO member-state: It was a venue in which they stood a real chance at gaining symbolic statehood status, and thus in theory putting more diplomatic pressure on Israel to sit down and negotiate.The Palestinians won their 2011 UNESCO membership by a thundering 107-14 margin (though 52 states abstained). However, this has produced little in the way of progress on an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement — and the consequences of the subsequent aid cutoff for UNESCO have been severe. Klaus Hüfner, an expert on UNESCO at the Global Policy Forum, termed it a “financial crisis.” This funding cutoff is severe enough that UNESCO has been forced to cut back both on irrelevant bloat and the extremely valuable environmental and educational activities. Trump’s decision, at the very least, won’t make things better.In formal terms, though, it won’t really change much. The US will become what the UN calls a “non-member observer state” in UNESCO: allowed to send representatives to UNESCO meetings but not vote in them. Since that’s basically what the US is now, that has little impact beyond the US’s formal title.“The organization has already adapted to losing funds from a key member, so I think the practical consequences will be small, says David Bosco, a political scientist at Indiana University. It’s possible, though, that the symbolism of formal US withdrawal could actually makes things even worse. As the US moves further away from UNESCO, other countries that fund it might follow their lead.“One concern for the organization might be whether the US move prompts a few others to leave or to be slow on their payments,” Bosco worries. “Organizations like UNESCO are always struggling to get members to pay their dues on time in any case.”It might also encourage UNESCO members to punish the US by antagonizing it further on Israel-Palestine issues. Earlier this year, UNESCO designated the core area of the West Bank city of Hebron — home to the Cave of the Patriarchs, an important religious site for Jews and Muslims — as a Palestinian World Heritage Site, a symbolic slight of both the US and Israel. It’s easy to imagine UNESCO voting to take more actions like this in the future.“Non-Western countries are already a powerful bloc in UNESCO, and their influence will increase further [after US withdrawal],” says Gowan. “Expect lots and lots more UNESCO resolutions bashing Israel, for a start.”Ultimately, though, it seems unlikely that the Trump administration cares all that much about this. The UN is exceptionally unpopular among many conservatives, elite and grassroots alike, who view it as deeply hostile to Israel. Earlier this year, the Trump administration floated massive cuts to US funding for the UN, which were popular with some pro-Israel conservatives but ultimately impractical.Withdrawing from UNESCO over Israel-related issues scores points with these supporters without having immediately tangible consequences for US security interests. “It's a relatively low-cost way for the Trump administration to strike a blow against the perceived flaws of the UN system,” Bosco says.The fact that withdrawing from an international cultural organization makes the US look bad, at a time when the world’s opinion of the US is already free-fall, doesn’t appear to be a major concern.“Trump will be able to sell the narrative that he is tough on the UN, despite actually walking back from some of his harshest demands for financial cuts. Non-Western countries like China will trumpet that this is a sign of US disengagement from the world,” Gowan tells me. “In a funny way, it's a win-win!”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Israel outpaced the world in vaccinations. Now it’s seeing the results.,2021-02-05,Vox,['Jen Kirby'],"Filed under:There’s still a long way to go, but also a reason for hope.Israel has outpaced the world in vaccinating its population against Covid-19. Now the results are starting to come in. And, so far, the news is mostly good for both Israel and the world. Data suggests that the outbreak has slowed in Israel from a January peak, although a rise in cases in recent days has threatened that progress. The number of seriously ill people has declined, particularly among those over 60, one of the groups targeted in the early rollout of the vaccination campaign.The vaccine, out in the wild, is also mirroring the results of clinical trials, which found the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (the dose most Israelis have received so far) was about 95 percent effective in reducing infections.Maccabi Health Services, one of Israel’s four health maintenance organizations (HMOs), tracked 163,000 Israelis who had received both of the two required doses of the Pfizer vaccine; only 31 of those people tested positive for Covid-19, compared to an unvaccinated sample in which about 6,500 did.According to data from the Israeli Ministry of Health, 531 of 750,000 fully vaccinated people over 60 years old tested positive for Covid-19 — which is just 0.07 percent. Out of the people who tested positive, only 38 were hospitalized, with symptoms ranging from moderate to critical. Another Israeli HMO, Clalit, found that Covid-19 positivity decreased by 33 percent among 200,000 people 14 days after they’d received just the first Pfizer dose compared to the same number of unvaccinated people.This is promising, especially as the world banks on a vaccine as the best path out of this pandemic and as new variants of the virus emerge. “We say with caution, the magic has started,” Eran Segal, a scientist at the Weizmann Institute, posted on Twitter, accompanied by data showing a decline in hospitalizations and critical illness among the 60-and-over group in recent weeks.But scientists caution that there’s still a long way to go. Experts noted that serious cases are declining, but overall infections are not diminishing as swiftly. And many of these studies rely on preliminary data, so these findings may change over time, especially with these new coronavirus variants emerging.Israel entered a strict lockdown in early January, just as the vaccination campaign was ramping up, which may have helped nudge cases downward.Who’s getting vaccinated, and how people might behave once they get those shots, may also influence the findings. Those who got vaccinated early and have gotten their full two doses might have been highly motivated; now comes the more challenging part of inoculating vaccine-hesitant or more marginalized communities. Israel has also faced criticism for its failure to extend its vaccination program to Palestinians, which could make herd immunity harder to achieve.Israel offers lessons in how to vaccinate a population quickly, but it’s also starting to show the challenges — and how difficult global immunization efforts are going to be. “Israel is the canary in the coal mine,” said Bruce Rosen, director of the Smokler Center for Health Policy Research at the Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute (MJB) in Jerusalem.Israel started its vaccination program in December. Since then, about a third of the country’s population (about 3 million people) has received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Nearly 1.8 million people have also gotten their second dose of the vaccine. That’s in a country of a little more than 9 million, according to recent figures from the Israel Ministry of Health.The rates are even higher for those in the over-60 group; for example, more than 90 percent of people between the ages of 70 and 79 have gotten the first vaccine dose, and nearly 80 percent the second. The vaccination program has since expanded so that anyone over the age of 16 is now eligible for a shot. Israel achieved this largely because of its existing health infrastructure, a universal, digitized system that gave the country a ready-made way to track and communicate with people. All Israeli citizens are enrolled in one of four health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for their care. Everyone has an ID number, which allows for easy access to electronic records. This system also allows health care workers to update a person’s vaccination status, monitor any side effects, and schedule an appointment for the next dose. Many Israelis said they got their appointment for the second dose shortly after getting injected with the first, usually scheduled for exactly 21 days later.This public health infrastructure meant massive vaccination sites popped up quickly, places that were accessible and big enough to be able to space people out and keep them as socially distanced as possible. Experts told me in January that Israel’s knack for responding in emergencies meant it was particularly suited for the logistical and speed challenges of a vaccination campaign.Israel also benefits from being a small country, and word of mouth did help in the vaccination rollout. Though Israel prioritized people over 60 and health care workers in the first phase of the campaign, it embraced a “no waste” policy, meaning vaccine providers prioritized using the doses above all else. If there were extra jabs at the end of the day or week, they might call in the pizza guy or the lady standing at the bus stop. “For a vaccination campaign, we are well-prepared, but we’re also flexible,” Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist at Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Public Health, told me in January. “When you plan, you don’t know, for example, how the cold chain will look, how many vaccines you will get — so you need to make rapid adjustments. And we are good at that.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (who, with elections approaching, has a lot to gain from a successful vaccination campaign) has said that Israel’s population could be fully vaccinated by the end of March.Experts said that’s still feasible, though it’s far from as simple as it sounds.Israel’s data indicates that the vaccines are working at the individual level; the outcomes of those who have been inoculated compare favorably to those who haven’t. Israel’s streamlined health infrastructure makes it very easy to know who’s been vaccinated and how they’re responding, and compare it against those who haven’t.But that system is also helping it win the vaccine race in another way: In a world where vaccines are in short supply, Israel is getting a regular stream in part because the country promised to provide the vast collection of vaccine data to Pfizer, so it can monitor the effects of the vaccine. (Israel, however, also reportedly paid a premium for the vaccine doses.)  But experts said it only gets more complicated from here, especially when it comes to achieving the goal of herd immunity — basically, when enough of the population is immune to the virus that it provides indirect protection to everyone else.New variants of the virus pose a challenge, especially if those mutations make the virus better at getting around the protections offered by the vaccine. Right now, the vaccines available have been shown to be broadly effective against these variants, but that could change.There are other questions scientists and public health experts want to answer. Brian Wahl, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while the vaccines are effective against the disease, they’re still learning about its impact on transmission. That is, how likely it is that a vaccinated person who doesn’t get ill from Covid-19 could still spread it. Another question is how long the protection from the vaccine will last. “We need to be continuing to look at how well the vaccine protects several months beyond administration, Wahl said.This is also a new vaccine, and not everyone is enthusiastic about getting it. Often the people first in line for their doses want to be there; it doesn’t take much to get them to their appointments. This is not always the case for vaccine-skeptical or vaccine-hesitant people, and getting those people vaccinated is a challenge Israel, and other countries, face.Israel’s Arab and Orthodox Jewish communities show greater degrees of reluctance to getting the vaccine, and the latter has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic.But Ann Blake, a postdoctoral fellow at Baylor College of Medicine who’s been studying  Israel’s efforts, said she feels optimistic about Israel’s ability to overcome some of this hesitancy. “Israel’s vaccination campaign showcases a coordinated and organized communications campaign that uses local community leaders and credible messengers in tandem with a synchronized message from the highest levels of government with the specific aim of encouraging vaccination among the vaccine hesitant,” she wrote in an email, adding that it could serve as a model for other countries, including here in the United States. Beyond hesitancy, experts pointed out that, right now, only people 16 or older are eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, and scientists are unsure when kids will be approved for Covid-19 vaccinations. All of that leaves a chunk of the population that won’t get vaccinated and could still transmit the virus. “If you had 100 percent [of people] vaccinated, it would be one thing,” Rosen said. “But you don’t. So this is much more complicated in reality.”Israel has also faced criticism for excluding Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from its vaccination campaign, despite making the shots available to Israeli settlers living in the West Bank.Israel says that based on the terms of the Oslo Accords, the 1990s agreements signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Palestinian Authority is responsible for health care in the Palestinian territories. But human rights and health groups have pressured Israel to “ensure that quality vaccines be provided to Palestinians living under Israeli occupation,” arguing that restrictions imposed by the occupation limit the Palestinian Authority’s purchasing and distribution capabilities.The Palestinian Authority doesn’t have anywhere near the resources Israel does. The territories just received 10,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine (which appears to be safe and effective); they are also supposed to get doses through the Covax facility, the WHO-linked international consortium, but distribution won’t begin until later this month. Israel did send about 2,000 Moderna doses to Palestinian authorities this week, with a  promise of 3,000 more. But that is nowhere close to enough to serve the entire population of more than 4.5 million.If Palestinians lack safe and effective vaccines, that could also undermine Israel’s efforts at achieving herd immunity, especially since many Palestinian workers move back and forth into Israel every day. “We have to insist that Israel is responsible for Palestinian health as an occupier, especially during pandemics, and that infectious diseases do not know borders,” Rita Giacaman, a professor of public health at the Institute of Community and Public Health at Birzeit University in the West Bank, told me.Indeed, the uneven distribution of vaccines will ultimately prolong the coronavirus crisis everywhere. Israel’s example shows how a rapid campaign can work, but also the limitations of just one country succeeding against the pandemic.

Netanyahu’s dangerous new settlements pledge could displace bedouins,2020-02-28,Vox,['Danna Takriti'],"Filed under:Days before the Israeli general elections, Netanyahu made a promise for new settlements that would evict Bedouin Arabs. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to allow 3,500 new Israeli settlements in a contested region of the West Bank known as the “E-1 zone,” short for East-1.E-1 is an “underpopulated” strip of land located between East Jerusalem, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, and the Ma’ale Adumim bloc, an Israeli settlement located in the West Bank. The E-1 zone is mostly inhabited by Bedouin Arab residents, Zachary Lockman, a professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies and history at New York University, told me. Plans to build Jewish settlements in the E-1 zone have been talked about for years now. But objections from the United States and Israel’s European allies have so far been able to pressure Israel to stop these plans from going forward. The concerns, experts say, is that such settlements would threaten a potential future peace deal with the Palestinians. And, because they would essentially cut off the northern and southern parts of the West Bank, the settlements could make the creation of a future contiguous Palestinian state even more difficult, if not impossible. “That’s why George W Bush and other US administrations, as well as the Europeans, repeatedly sought guarantees from the Israeli government that they would not build in E1,” Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told me. But the Trump administration has taken a far more indulgent approach to Israel than previous US administrations have — and it seems unlikely to make any meaningful effort to try to thwart Netanyahu’s plans this time around. “Now, with Trump’s apparent blessing, Netanyahu is talking about moving ahead,” Lockman said. “It may be an election ploy [by Netanyahu] to make his right-wing voters and allies happy,” Lockman said. Israel goes to the polls next week, and Netanyahu — who is facing trial for charges of bribery and fraud — is trying to rally voters to his side. Even so, Lockman added, the prime minister would “certainly like” to move forward with the E-1 settlement plans.If it happens, though, it won’t just be the future of Israeli-Palestinian peace that will be put in jeopardy. The lives and livelihoods of the Bedouins who mostly populate the E-1 area could also be put at serious risk.Building settlements in the E-1 zone would “in effect cut the West Bank in half and make any kind of future Palestinian state in the West Bank even less attainable,” Lockman told me. Cutting the West Bank in half is a significant step toward diminishing any potential future for a recognized Palestinian state. This is because it would ultimately “cement the territorial connection between Jerusalem and Ma’ale Adumim,” Lockman said. That, in fact, is the entire point of the E-1 plan from the point of view of the Israeli government and other supporters of the settlement plan. “The linking of Jerusalem to Maale Adumim is an overriding Israeli interest,” wrote Nadav Shragai in a 2013 study published by the right-wing Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs research institute. Cementing this connection, though, would in turn block Palestinian residents from accessing occupied East Jerusalem. That is partly why Elgindy told me that going forward with this plan would compromise the future of Palestine.“E-1 was always considered the ‘doomsday’ settlement, the one that would make a future Palestinian state impossible,” he said. He added that, under international law, building these settlements “would be a war crime.” Essentially, with settlements in E-1, any future “two-state” plan would be unworkable. “The two-state concept is pretty dead anyway, killed by the massive Israeli settlement project underway since 1967 and the de facto annexation of chunks of the West Bank. But this would be one more big nail in the coffin of that vision,” Lockman said.The E-1 zone is often described as deserted, or a “ghost town,” but that’s not exactly true. The area is home to 18 Bedouin tribes.“As elsewhere in the West Bank, Jewish settlements would be built on land taken in one way or another from Palestinians; in this case, the Bedouin would be kicked off lands they’ve lived on for generations,” Lockman said.This is not the first time Bedouins have been evicted by Israel to build settlements. To expand Ma’ale Adumim in 1997, Israel kicked out more than 100 bedouin families, forcing them to move to areas less well suited to their traditionally pastoral, nomadic way of life. “Their new plots of land had little grazing space; most were forced to sell their flocks, and now work for Israeli companies as labourers,” the Economist wrote in 2016.“We’re like fish in the water,” Abu Imad, a leader of the Abu Nawwar tribe, told the Economist. “Our lives are in the desert, and we will die if we’re moved.”Right-wing supporters of the E-1 settlement plan, on the other hand, argue that it is the Bedouins who are “encroaching” on the area. As Shragai argued in the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs study:Palestinian and Bedouin settlement is encroaching on this space all the time, the great majority of it illegal: that is, this Palestinian construction is executed without any building permit. According to the Oslo II Interim Agreement, the territory between Jerusalem and Maale Adumim has been designated as Area C, meaning that the powers of zoning and planning were retained here by Israel. Illegal Palestinian construction enables the takeover of vitally important land, some of it within the E1 area.However, the vast majority of experts in the international community reject this alternative interpretation of the law and the current situation in the E-1 zone.  Indeed, the UN secretary-general in 2015 “voiced concerns at the deteriorating human rights and humanitarian situations facing Palestinian Bedouin and herder populations affected by home demolitions and Israeli plans for ‘relocation’ of entire communities,” and argued that “the transfer of Palestinian Bedouin communities would contravene the obligations of Israel under international human rights law, particularly regarding the rights to freedom of residence and to adequate housing.”Even worse, many of the Bedouin families who would be forced to relocate if the E-1 settlement plan goes forward have been forced to move and had their homes demolished several times already.“The demolition has been devastating and our situation is miserable,” Umm Muhammed, a Bedouin woman whose home was demolished in January 2017, told the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. “We’re homeless. It’s been psychologically tiring for all of us. I personally feel powerless and unwell. Where shall we go? And how shall we live here?” The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Benjamin Netanyahu failed Israel,2023-10-09,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:We can now be sure: His policy of repressing Palestinians doesn’t make Israelis safe.In the past 24 hours, two reports out of Israel have pointed to a striking conclusion: that the failure to prevent Hamas’s murderous assault on southern Israel rests in significant part with the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.First, the Washington Post’s Noga Tarnopolsky and Shira Rubin wrote a lengthy dispatch on the many policy failures that allowed Hamas to break through. They find that, in addition to myriad unforgivable intelligence and military mistakes — especially shocking given Israel’s reputation in both fields — there were serious political problems. Distracted by both the fight to seize control over Israel’s judiciary and their effort to deepen Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Netanyahu and his cabinet allowed military readiness to degrade and left outposts on the Gaza border in the south unmanned.“There was a need for more soldiers, so where did they take them from? From the Gaza border, where they thought it was calm ... not surprising that Hamas and Islamic Jihad noticed the low staffing at the border,” Aharon Zeevi Farkash, the former head of the Israel Defense Forces’ military intelligence, said in comments reported by the Post. Second, a columnist at Israel’s Ha’aretz newspaper unearthed evidence that Netanyahu has intentionally propped up Hamas rule in Gaza — seeing Palestinian extremism as a bulwark against a two-state solution to the conflict. “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,” the prime minister reportedly said at a 2019 meeting of his Likud party. “This is part of our strategy — to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.”These exact comments have not yet been confirmed by other sources. But the Times of Israel’s Tal Schneider wrote on Sunday that Netanyahu’s reported words “are in line with the policy that he implemented,” which did little to challenge and in some ways bolstered Hamas’s control over the Gaza Strip. Moreover, Schneider notes, “the same messaging was repeated by right-wing commentators, who may have received briefings on the matter or talked to Likud higher-ups and understood the message.” Some Netanyahu confidants have said the same thing, as have outside experts.Put together, these two pieces tell a larger story: that the strategic vision of Netanyahu’s far-right government is a failure. The notion that Israel can deliver security for its citizens by dividing and conquering Palestinians, crushing them into submission as a kind of colonial overlord, is both immoral and counterproductive on its own terms. Recognizing this reality will be crucial to formulating not only a humane response to Hamas’s atrocity, but an effective one.In 2017, Israeli far-right parliamentarian Bezalel Smotrich proposed what he termed a “decisive plan” to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Smotrich, who is now serving as finance minister in Netanyahu’s cabinet, argued (correctly) that the root of the conflict was competing claims to the same land from two distinct national groups. But, unlike his centrist peers, Smotrich claimed that these ambitions were incommensurable: that no territorial compromise could ever be reached between Israelis and Palestinians. In such a zero-sum conflict, one side has to win and the other has to lose. The key to Israel winning such a total victory, he wrote, is simple: Break the Palestinians’ spirit. “Terrorism derives from hope — a hope to weaken us,” Smotrich argued. “The statement that the Arab yearning for national expression in the Land of Israel cannot be ‘repressed’ is incorrect.”Doing this, he continued, begins by annexing the West Bank and rapidly expanding Jewish settlements there. Once Israel has declared its intention to never let that land go, and created realities on the ground that make its withdrawal unimaginable, the Palestinians will reconcile themselves to the new reality — accept a second-class form of citizenship, leave voluntarily, or attempt violent resistance and be crushed. Smotrich has used his time in Netanyahu’s cabinet to try to implement this plan — working both to de facto annex the West Bank and to rapidly expand Jewish settlement. The result has been the exact opposite of what Smotrich thought would happen: Atrocities by emboldened settler extremists ignited Palestinian anger. Atrocities committed by Palestinians led to settler retaliation, creating an unstable situation requiring a significant redeployment of Israel Defense Forces resources to the West Bank — whose raids themselves became a source of Palestinian grievance.And that, per the Washington Post, is why those troops weren’t on Gaza’s border. Israel’s forces, who should have been defending against terrorists in Gaza, had been dragged to the West Bank as a consequence, at least in part, of the far right’s ideological project.In fairness to Smotrich, he did admit in his 2017 proposal that his favored policies would likely meet with violent resistance: “In the first stage, it is likely that the Arab terror efforts will only increase.” This, he argued, would represent “a last desperate attempt to actualize their goals.”Yet the current Hamas attack, and the longer history of Israel-Gaza, does not appear to track such a trajectory. Israel has besieged Gaza for about 16 years, and fought multiple wars with Hamas and other Palestinian militants in the strip. They were not under imminent risk of being stamped out by Israel prior to this attack, nor is there any evidence that Hamas leadership believed this was the final window to try to stop Israel from seizing control of the West Bank. Calling Palestinian terrorism a pure product of “hope” is a simple ideological construction at war with a more complex reality.A notable thing about Smotrich’s 2017 document is that it contains exactly zero proposals for dealing with Gaza. In his mind, the conflict will be decided in the West Bank — specifically, by Israel’s successful assertion of full control. Gaza is basically an afterthought, discussed only as offhand evidence that the Palestinians can’t be trusted to govern themselves.This omission was always an obvious problem, one of many in Smotrich’s cruel thinking. But now it points to something more: an indictment of not just Smotrich, but the government he serves in.Israel’s prime minister is not as ideological as Smotrich. Netanyahu’s primary political concerns at present are maintaining power and staying out of jail. He has elevated extremists like Smotrich to the cabinet not purely out of ideological affinity, but because they’re the ones who would back his assault on the independence of the Israeli judiciary.But at the same time, his approach to the Palestinians has long evidenced the same basic assumption as Smotrich’s “decisive plan”: that they can and must be crushed.Netanyahu is Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, with three distinct stints in office: 1996–1999, 2009–2021, and 2022–today. During this time, he has been consistently hostile to Palestinian national aspirations — either outright opposing a two-state solution to the conflict or at most paying insincere lip service to it. It’s not for nothing that Smotrich wrote in his 2017 document that “in democratic terms, there is no daylight between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and the plan before you.” He assessed, as the prime minister’s actions have borne out, that Netanyahu never had any intention of granting Palestinians true self-determination.This is why Netanyahu reportedly saw Hamas rule in Gaza as something of an asset. So long as the Palestinians remain divided among themselves — Hamas in charge of Gaza and the moderate Fatah faction in power in the West Bank — then a peace agreement is likely impossible: You can’t come to a negotiated settlement without a unified negotiating partner. The terrorist threat Hamas poses, on this thinking, can be managed; the endless blockade and periodic military operations, euphemistically called “mowing the grass,” can keep the danger posed by Hamas within acceptable parameters. One of the key differences between Smotrich and Netanyahu is that the former was less subtle. While Smotrich’s plan aimed for a “decisive” defeat of the Palestinians announced through formal West Bank annexation, Netanyahu basically aimed to keep slowly entrenching the status quo of Israeli control forever. He presided over a gradual pressure campaign, one where Israel incrementally expands its presence in the West Bank while Palestinians are prevented from mounting anything but token resistance.Netanyahu’s approach grew out of events on the ground. When the peace process pushed by left-wing parties in power in the 1990s failed, giving rise to the terrorist violence of Second Intifada, many ordinary Jewish Israelis concluded that the Palestinians simply couldn’t be negotiated with and moved to the right. The center of political gravity shifted away from long-term solutions to the conflict and toward an approach of simply learning to manage it as best as possible. This does not mean most Israeli Jews became ideological right-wingers; they are not, polling suggests, fully committed to the project of expanding settlements or West Bank annexation. Mostly, they wanted Netanyahu and the right to keep them safe in a way that the left seemingly couldn’t. The prime minister, in recognition of this reality, campaigned first and foremost on security — earning the moniker, perhaps self-claimed, of “Mr. Security.”Hamas’s attack on Saturday, a mass slaughter of Israeli civilians without precedent in Israeli history, exposed a basic contradiction in this image in the most agonizing way. Simply put, there is no way now to argue that the right-wing ideological project has delivered the security most Israelis crave.The more Israel deepens its control over the West Bank, spreading settlements across its lands, the more Palestinians resent them — and the more Israel has to devote its military resources to repressing Palestinians rather than protecting Israel inside its borders. Nor is there any long-run hope that the Palestinians will simply give up. Hamas’s willingness to engage in brutal violence, sure to be met with an overwhelming response from Israel — one that has reportedly taken the lives of hundreds of people in Gaza so far — indicates that even 16 years of blockade can’t end the incentive for terrorism.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]If the failure of the peace process exposed problems in the left’s vision for the conflict, the Hamas attack has exposed the fundamental emptiness of the right’s. The more you hurt ordinary Palestinians, the more you give succor to the extremist visions of monsters like Hamas. The more you draw Israel into the West Bank, the more you entangle Israelis in a system of domination over Palestinians — one that will ultimately deliver nothing but heartbreak for anyone involved.To be clear: I am not saying Israelis brought these attacks on themselves, that it’s some kind of moral chickens coming home to roost. Nor am I saying that Netanyahu, in place of Hamas, bears moral responsibility for Hamas’s horrifying atrocities against civilians. What I am saying is that Netanyahu’s policy — visiting harm on the Palestinians in the name of protecting Israelis — is a terrible one. It is both morally indefensible and strategically counterproductive. It is no concession to Hamas, nor legitimation of its violence, to recognize this reality.After last weekend’s events, it’s exceedingly obvious that trying to crush the Palestinians through settlement and division is not helping anyone.

Most of Israel’s weapons imports come from the US. Now Biden is rushing even more arms.,2023-11-18,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:What the US sending Israel weapons “at the speed of war” looks like.One area where the Biden administration has set itself apart is in sending weapons to partner countries, and now we’re getting a more complete picture of what the US is sending Israel in the weeks since October 7.Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the US has ramped up its previously minimal military aid to the country to an unparalleled $46.7 billion. Ukraine towers over the other major recipients in bar charts of US security assistance for 2022 and ’23. The US is sending so many munitions there that it has apparently strained American factories and led to a whole-of-government effort to revive military supply chains.The US is also accelerating arms transfers to Israel in response to Hamas’s October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people and resulted in the kidnapping of more than 200. Last month, President Joe Biden announced from the Oval Office that he would seek “an unprecedented support package for Israel’s defense” of $14.3 billion. “We’re surging additional military assistance,” he added.But while Ukraine has never been a traditional recipient of heavy military aid, the US’s most recent support of the Israeli military builds on a long bipartisan American practice. Israel has received about $3 billion annually, adjusted for inflation, for the last 50 years, and is the largest historical recipient of US security aid. The Obama administration in 2016 announced the biggest security assistance package to the country ever, pledging $38 billion for Israel over the next decade. US support has ensured that Israel maintains its qualitative military edge over neighboring Arab countries by having more advanced weapons systems, something Congress wrote into law in 2008.Israel would not be able to conduct this war without the US, which over time has provided Israel with about 80 percent of the country’s weapons imports. Israel is using them as part of its large-scale military operation that has so far killed over 11,000 Palestinians and destroyed hospitals and civilian infrastructure. While it is the Israeli Defense Forces doing the killing, the extent of US aid has raised serious questions about American culpability. “Providing weapons that knowingly and significantly would contribute to unlawful attacks can make those providing them complicit in war crimes,” Human Rights Watch said.Which weapons, exactly, the US is sending to fill Israel’s requests since October 7 has been hitherto kept secret — in contrast to how the US publicizes the weapons it delivers to Ukraine. But Bloomberg this week published a leaked Pentagon document that showed the US has delivered 2,000 Hellfire missiles that can be launched from Apache helicopters, as well as an array of other mortars and ammo, including “36,000 rounds of 30mm cannon ammunition, 1,800 of the requested M141 bunker-buster munitions and at least 3,500 night-vision devices.” This year, military budgets around the world hit all-time highs. Israel in recent years has been growing its arms export business. It also imports significant weapons from the UK, Italy, Canada, and Germany, but 92 percent of what Israel gets comes from the United States. As researcher William Hartung wrote recently in The Nation, “Israel’s arsenal, and its arms industry, are by and large made in, and financed by, the USA.”The Biden administration has a robust understanding of weapons systems and the business behind them. While any mainstream US administration, Republican or Democrat, would likely be rushing weapons orders to Israel, this administration is uniquely qualified to do so, bringing to bear their successes on Ukraine arms transfer and experience advising weapons-makers. In the second year of his presidency, Biden’s arms sales overtook President Donald Trump’s, who himself had already overseen a big increase.The House voted in favor of new military assistance to Israel but cut out the Ukraine aid component, so the Senate will likely not pass it. In the meantime, the Biden administration has been efficient and quiet about transfers, using creative tools to jump-start deliveries to Israel that include direct commercial sales from arms-makers (meaning the US isn’t financing the purchases but does allow American weapons manufacturers to sell to Israel), governmental financing vehicles that don’t require congressional approval, and hurrying up orders that were placed before October. Stockpiles meant for US use are also being diverted to Israel. As a senior Pentagon official put it, “expediting security assistance” to Israel has been task number one.Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is a former board member of Raytheon, the major military contractor that co-produces Iron Dome receptors with the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. RTX, as Raytheon has been renamed, is one of the most significant providers to Israel. Austin and many other senior appointees to the Pentagon bring a depth of experience working for the arms industry. Even if they aren’t directly involved in the day-to-day — Austin has had to recuse himself from the Department of Defense’s dealings with Raytheon — the heft these appointments bring shows the seriousness with which the Biden administration takes the defense industrial base. As Austin told the Senate, “We are flowing security assistance to Israel at the speed of war.”Secretary of State Antony Blinken co-founded WestExec Advisors in 2017, which has worked for military contractors, new military-tech startups, and Israeli companies. Blinken, for his part, advised the defense contractor Boeing, according to his financial disclosure. Last month, Boeing rushed the transfer of 1,000 smart bombs and 1,800 GPS-guidance bomb kits to Israel.Much of the team that worked to get Israel the $38 billion Obama package over 10 years is leading the way. Other key State Department officials include Daniel Shapiro, who also worked for the Israel spyware maker NSO Group when he was out of government. Intelligence leaders, too, bring vast experience. Avril Haines, the director of the Office of National Intelligence, has worked as an adviser to the data-processing powerhouse Palantir, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel and apparently provides advanced tech to the Israeli military.The foundation of relationships between the defense industries in the US, Israel, and its other partners in the region also helps. When the world’s biggest aerospace and defense companies gathered at the Dubai Airshow this week, for example, Israeli defense firms and officials kept a low profile — but the big deals continued. Take the US-Israel-UAE triangle, which benefits each country. Boeing, an American company, signed a $52 billion airliner contract with a UAE carrier. On the sidelines of the fair, business people discussed “the impact of the demand for equipment stemming from the conflicts in Gaza” and “Close U.S.-U.A.E. alignment on the Israel-Gaza conflict,” according to the US-UAE Business Council. At the same time, Elbit Systems’ Emirati subsidiary is selling $53 million of military tech to the UAE.The US has promoted the long lists of weapons it is sending to Ukraine, publishing one-pagers and tallies that go into great detail. But as the Intercept’s Ken Klippenstein noted, the Biden administration has kept the list of weapons it’s sending to Israel secret. The administration has also “sought permission to unilaterally blanket-approve the future sale of military equipment and weapons — like ballistic missiles and artillery ammunition  —  to Israel without notifying Congress,” according to the watchdog group Women for Weapons Trade Transparency. That would remove a key mechanism for oversight from lawmakers — and scrutiny from the public.Many of these weapons are now being used in Gaza, with catastrophic humanitarian results. That has led the United Nations, French President Emmanuel Macron, and a number of international organizations to urge an immediate ceasefire. Human Rights Watch has called for war crimes investigations into the Israeli bombardment of the health care system. “The emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy,” Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said last month. That heavy bombardment and death toll prompted the UN’s high commissioner for human rights to say Thursday that “the killing of so many civilians cannot be dismissed as collateral damage.” Given this, some activists are protesting US military aid to Israel and are calling for a ceasefire. One group called Palestine Action has been staging actions in the US and the United Kingdom at the facilities of Elbit Systems, an Israeli military contractor. About 150 protesters picketed Raytheon Technologies in El Segundo, California, for its arms trade with Israel. Josh Paul, a former senior State Department official overseeing arms sales who resigned in protest last month, has been straightforward in saying that Israel is in violation of international law. “It is my opinion that Israel is committing war crimes in its actions in Gaza right now,” he said. “And it’s not just my opinion. I’ve actually heard from officials across government, including elected officials at a very senior level, who share that opinion but aren’t willing to say it in public.”This may be setting up Israel for a collision with the Biden administration. In February 2022, Biden strengthened the human rights component of US arms transfers. The administration put a new emphasis on human rights in the Conventional Arms Transfer policy that added safeguards for “elevating the importance of protecting civilians.” The policy specifically restricted the transfer of weapons that are “more likely than not” to be used in atrocities, including violations of the Geneva Convention or of international humanitarian law. The Biden administration may be “violating its own conventional arms transfer policy” by sending arms to Israel, as Seth Binder of the Project on Middle East Democracy recently told Jacobin. But senior Biden officials insist the administration is upholding its commitments. “All of our arms transfers, including arms transfers to Israel, are rooted in the basic proposition that they will be used consistent with [the] law of armed conflict,” Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said last month. “There is no exception here and no difference here from any of our other arms transfers.” The administration regularly conveys to Israel the importance of humanitarian laws, that “innocent civilians must be taken [in]to account for any operation,” according to Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh.Some of the concerns relate specifically to the kinds of weapons the US delivers. The document that Bloomberg obtained showed that the US is sending Israel 57,000 of the 155mm shells that are used in artillery guns. A group of humanitarian aid groups and security experts had sent a letter to the secretary of defense earlier in the week urging the Biden administration not to send these shells to Israel, saying they are “inherently indiscriminate” and “have a high error radius, often landing 25 meters away from the intended target,” which would be particularly destructive in a place as densely populated as Gaza.As arms trade accelerates and scrutiny on Israel’s operations heightens, the reason for the strengthening of the arms transfer policy’s human rights component seems more relevant than ever. “It is not in the US national interest to engage in arms transfers where we assess that they are likely to be used in human rights violations,” Christopher Le Mon, a senior State Department official, said in March. “It does not advance our national interests, it does not advance our national security.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"What a ""complete siege"" of Gaza will mean for Palestinians",2023-10-09,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Gaza was already under siege. Now it will get worse. Israel says it will place Gaza, the occupied territory it has long blockaded, under a “complete siege” after the weekend’s attack by Hamas.On Saturday, the Palestinian military group launched intensive attacks from Gaza into Israel. Hamas overwhelmed Israeli military installations, kidnapped civilians and reportedly soldiers, and dispatched rockets on Israeli civilians in attacks that have killed an estimated 1,200 people as of Wednesday. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was caught flat-footed despite Israel having the Middle East’s most advanced military and surveillance state.Now comes the reaction. Israel has called up over 300,000 military reservists, and many analysts expect that Israel will send in ground troops. “I ordered a complete siege on Gaza. We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Monday. “As of now, no electricity, no food, no fuel for Gaza.” But Gaza has been described as living under siege for 15 years, as documented by United Nations experts, journalists, and human rights researchers.Israel and Egypt control the territory’s border crossings, and Israel controls its access to the Mediterranean Sea and its airspace. More than 2 million Palestinian people reside in a narrow strip, only about twice the area of Washington, DC. The humanitarian crisis that Palestinians have endured in Gaza has been severe even before this latest conflict, and now it will get much worse.The Ministry of Health in Gaza reports that so far, at least 830 Palestinians have been killed and 4,250 injured. “Hospitals are overcrowded with injured people, there is a shortage of drugs and consumables, and a shortage of fuel for generators,” Ayman Al-Djaroucha, the Médecins Sans Frontières deputy coordinator in Gaza, told Reliefweb.The scale of violence has already exceeded the most recent severe conflict between Israel and Hamas. Over a two-week period in May 2021, Palestinian militants killed 12 Israeli civilians and one soldier; Israel’s airstrikes killed more than 250 people, at least 129 of them civilians, in Gaza and injured 1,948 people. The Israel-Palestine conflict has always been asymmetrical: Israel, a nuclear power, has received tens of billions of dollars of US military aid. This weekend, Hamas ruptured Israeli society with wanton violence and mass killing, the scale of which is becoming clearer as days pass. But it is the Israeli state that retains the capacity to perpetuate an all-out war on the Gaza Strip. Israel has often responded disproportionately to suicide bombings and rocket attacks from Hamas, partially as a deterrent strategy. The result, however, is an intensity of violence in an occupied territory where residents have nowhere to run, where civilians are regularly killed in Israel’s assaults on Hamas targets.Now, after suffering its most devastating and brutal attack in decades, Israel is starting to respond. Based on Israeli officials’ rhetoric, this will likely also be more devastating for Gaza than anything that has come before.“Over the next several days, as the Israeli military bombardment of Gaza runs up the civilian death toll, it will say it is striking what it knows to be military targets,” Yousef Munayyer, a researcher with the Arab Center in DC, says. But Hamas’s surprise attacks “exposed just how much Israel doesn’t know about what is going on in Gaza.”Hamas, a political and militant faction that the US designates as a terrorist organization for its armed resistance to Israel, took over Gaza in 2007. Since then, Israel has instituted a blockade on the territory that has significantly affected the quality of life: There are extreme rates of poverty, over 60 percent of people need food assistance, and access to health care is extremely limited. UN experts have described it as “collective punishment.” About a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza, and nearly 80 percent of youth, are unemployed.Israel and Egypt have never allowed enough construction materials into the border crossings under their control to enable Gaza’s rebuilding after conflicts. (During the May 2021 conflict, about 58,000 homes were destroyed, and Israel leveled a 12-story high-rise in Gaza that it said contained Hamas assets but also contained the offices of the news agencies Associated Press and Al Jazeera English, and the homes of many families.) The political economy of Gaza features something rare and troubling: de-development, which Harvard scholar Sara Roy defines as “the systematic dismantling of a normal economy and its rational functioning.” She has conducted fieldwork there that shows Israel deliberately impedes the betterment of the occupied territory’s living conditions. “The Gaza Strip is the scene of a humanitarian disaster that has nothing to do with natural causes — it is entirely man-made, a direct result of official Israeli policy,” according to B’tselem, the Israeli human rights group. Hamas retains some popularity in Gaza, but many Palestinians see the group as corrupt and incapable of addressing the needs of residents. A survey of Palestinians from this summer showed that if legislative elections were held for the first time since 2006, about 44 percent of Gazan voters would choose Hamas. But there has been no opportunity for elections, and so Palestinians living in Gaza must endure an unrepresentative government which imposes some Islamic tenets and implements repressive policies against LGBTQ people and abusive policies against detainees. Now, life in Gaza will get worse. The over 2 million people in the territory largely rely on Israel for power, either directly via Israeli power lines, or indirectly via fuel supplied through Israel and Egypt to Gaza’s diesel-reliant power plant. On Wednesday, electricity went out in Gaza; that will soon have knock-on effects, like exacerbating a lack of potable water if there is not enough power for the territory’s desalination plants to operate, and leaving overwhelmed hospitals with only days of generator-fueled power.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]Relief organizations like the World Food Programme and Mercy Corps have called for humanitarian corridors “to facilitate the entry of critical supplies like medicine, food, and water.”The Israeli military has not released additional details about what the “complete siege” will look like, but Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel would turn “all the places that Hamas hides in, operates from ... into ruins.”After barrages of artillery and rocket fire, ground operations to target Hamas fighters may follow.In the process, the already thrashed Gaza may look like some of the most acute humanitarian crises in war zones from recent memory, like Aleppo amid Syria’s civil war or Mariupol after the Russian assault on Ukraine.The US fully backs Israel in response to the weekend’s attacks. “In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere that the United States stands with Israel,” President Joe Biden said on Saturday. He added, “This is also a terrible tragedy on a human level. It’s hurting innocent people.”But many experts are also concerned about how much more suffering could occur, and that goes unmentioned in some of the US’s public statements. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, for example, told CNN, “Our first focus is to make sure that Israel has what it needs to deal with the situation in Gaza.” In an interview with ABC, Blinken warned about the risks of other militant groups and states in the region getting involved, and he told CBS, “And whatever Israel does in Gaza, as always, we look to it to do everything possible to avoid civilian casualities, something, of course, that Hamas doesn’t do.”Hamas has targeted civilians, in a devastating manner. But human rights defenders and experts on the Middle East worry that, without a clearer call for restraint from US officials, such language can serve as a tacit encouragement of the kind of destructive tactics that Israel has subjected Gaza to several times over. The Biden administration has often used the phrase “rules-based order” to describe its goal of maintaining global stability, pointing out that Russia violated that order by invading Ukraine, for example. That terminology is not being deployed on cable news networks now as Blinken’s colleagues brief the press. In this heated moment, even calling for a ceasefire appears to be beyond the pale. Blinken spoke with his Turkish counterpart and shared on social media a brief summary of the call, saying he had “encouraged Turkey’s advocacy for a cease-fire and the release of all hostages by Hamas immediately.” And then he deleted that post, according to Ha’aretz. Instead, Blinken then posted, “Israel has the right to defend itself, rescue any hostages, and protect its citizens.”Hamas’s violence demands condemnation. But calls for a ceasefire or restraint are necessary. The UN, for example, is talking with leaders and encouraging them to “exercise maximum restraint ... to prevent further risks of escalation and loss of life.”  “For a long time, I’ve believed that the only thing standing in the way of Israel wiping out Gaza entirely or pushing Gazans into the Sinai has been the ‘international community,’” Tariq Kenney-Shawa, an analyst with the Palestinian research group Al-Shabaka, told me. But the fact that few world leaders have called on Israel to exercise restraint, and that a superpower like the US is sending an aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean as a show of support for its closest ally, suggests that Israel has the latitude to do what it had not done in previous operations on Gaza: launch an all-out war.Kenney-Shawa fears a catastrophe on the spectrum of the Nakba, the expulsion of Palestinians in 1948 when the state of Israel was established, which resulted in 15,000 Palestinians killed, more than 500 villages destroyed, and about 750,000 Palestinians displaced.   “I think Palestinians are at risk of another Nakba,” he told me.

How the Arab world sees the Israel-Palestine conflict,2023-10-14,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Protests in the Middle East show the centrality of Palestine.Demonstrations of solidarity with Palestinians have broken out across the Arab world this week, as Israel reels from Hamas’s massive attack and Palestinians in Gaza come under bombardment. Moroccans, Jordanians, and Egyptians have rallied in protests large and small, even as the governments of these countries have built and maintained varying degrees of diplomatic ties with Israel. And while those demonstrations may seem jarring given the widespread deaths in Israel this week, the fact that some have cheered on violence against civilians may obscure the broader political dynamics at play — both within the Middle East and within the Arab countries themselves.Hamas’s violence does not reflect the desire of all, or even most, Palestinians who seek rights and freedoms. But the solidarity expressed in these rallies reflects a broader dissatisfaction with how Israel, with Western support, has subjected Palestinians to military occupation since 1967. The protests also represent a rare space for political expression in largely autocratic states where regimes severely limit such speech. In the Arab world, people have been as quick to show support for Palestine as most American politicians have for Israel. On Friday, after prayers at Egypt’s al-Azhar Mosque, protesters filled the streets. As did tens of thousands of Iraqis in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, thousands of Jordanians protesting in the capital and in major cities, and hundreds who gathered outside a central mosque in Qatar, along with protesters in Lebanon, Oman, Tunisia, and Yemen. Demonstrators burned Israeli flags and chanted against Israel’s military campaign.Without understanding the full history of the conflict and the region, some American readers could dismiss everyone participating in these protests as “angry Arabs,” a repugnant trope that has permeated Western media for a century and was heightened after 9/11. It may still be jarring to watch for many, but the forces that drive the protests go deep — and will only deepen as the latest war unfolds.For Palestinians and Arabs, the war did not begin on the morning of October 7 with Hamas’s attacks on Israel. Rather, for them, the war has been ongoing since 1948, when militias expelled Palestinians from their homes and killed tens of thousands in what is called the Nakba, or catastrophe. It continued with the 1967 setback — as the Six-Day War is called in Arabic — in which Israel began occupying the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem, and has carried on through waves of further conflicts and protests. That support is rooted in a history of grassroots support for Palestinians and of Arab strongmen using the cause as a populist rallying point. “It’s the open wound, the festering sore, on the Arab conscience,” Mouin Rabbani, an analyst of Palestinian politics and co-editor of the web journal Jadaliyya, told me. “When you go back to the 1950s and the 1960s, the heyday of Arab nationalism, Palestine was the central Arab cause, so much so that many Arab leaders could use it, instrumentalize it, and exploit it to either help them achieve power or stay in power or improve their popularity at home.”The religious component is also important, with so many holy sites for Muslims within Jerusalem and throughout Israel and the occupied territories. The Arab-Israeli conflict is a political conflict over land, and it has never been primarily a religious war. (For centuries, Jews and Muslims had gotten along throughout the Middle East and beyond.) Yet images of Israeli security forces in mosques of significant historic meaning can indeed galvanize emotional response. And the same goes for churches in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, among other holy sites for Arab Christians. Nonetheless, most Arabs, according to polling conducted over two decades by the Arab Barometer, would be willing to have diplomatic relations with Israel — but only after the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. “They’re not against coexisting with a Jewish-majority Israeli state, which is what exists now, but they will not do that until the Palestinians get their rights,” Rami Khouri, a Palestinian-Jordanian journalist and a policy fellow at the American University of Beirut, told me. “The popular sentiment across the whole region supporting Palestinian rights is very strong and very deep,” Khouri told me. “Most Arab citizens are bludgeoned by their own autocratic systems, and increasingly by severe economic stress,” he explained. “So the Palestine struggle is vicariously seen by many in the region as an anti-colonial struggle.”As long as both Arab rulers and their populations remained united in the idea that there could be no progress with Israel without significant progress in the Palestinian cause, normalization of Israel’s ties with its Middle East neighbors — long a goal of politicians there and in the US — was off the table. But in recent years, that had begun to change. Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979, and neighboring Jordan followed in 1993. Such deals were often far from popular at home — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Islamic militants who were against the peace deal. Other Arab states held out, insisting first on the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state. US policy since President George H.W. Bush has been focused on a peace process that would lead to that outcome, and the goal as set out by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama was two states for two peoples. When President Donald Trump focused on a series of normalization deals between Israel and Arab states in 2020, however, he sidelined the cause of Palestine. Saudi Arabia, which had long emphasized the importance of a Palestinian state, had already been quietly developing extensive business and military relationships with Israel. Suddenly it seemed possible that the Palestinian cause could be sacrificed by the Arab world’s rulers.But all of the countries involved in the normalization negotiations — the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco — are autocracies. And their citizens were not as eager to go along with a new Middle East. In response, the governments of these countries censored criticism of the deals in the press and stifled public protests. “Activists who were involved in pro-Palestine activism — either through local organizations or through the Gulf Coalition Against Normalization — also reported worsening online harassment, forcing many to take a step back from their activities,” Dana El Kurd, a political scientist at the University of Richmond, writes.Surveys show how unpopular those accords were. Recent polls show their Arab support has dropped significantly since 2020, with just 27 percent of Emiratis and 20 percent of Bahrainis in favor of the accords.“If you had democracy in the Arab world, you wouldn’t have any normalization,” historian Rashid Khalidi of Columbia University told me. “Public opinion is overwhelmingly against normalization with Israel. Overwhelmingly, in every poll in every country.” The past few days have seen renewed calls for boycotting of Israeli-linked businesses in Bahrain and Qatar, and a resurgence of anti-normalization activism in Gulf countries, El Kurd told me. Far from being relegated to the backburner, the Palestinian cause is now front and center in the Arab world. And that is something American policymakers can’t afford to ignore.Palestine is so central to the Arab Middle East that even US military leaders historically understood the peril of ignoring the Palestinian cause.When David Petraeus, then the top US military commander in the Middle East, went before the Senate in 2010, he warned that the unresolved Israel-Palestinian conflict was endangering American lives. “The enduring hostilities between Israel and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests,” he testified. “The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of US favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and depth of US partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR [area of responsibility] and weakens the legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world.”But President Biden’s policies have not recognized the centrality of Palestine in the region. Instead, Biden spent last year repairing relations with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and prioritized a diplomatic deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that now appears dead on arrival.Biden told the United Nations last month that his team is working “tirelessly to support a just and lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians — two states for two people.” But in reality, the administration’s empty commitment to the two-state solution has precluded the development of actual policies that would lead to peace.Where does that leave a US policy focused on normalization in a region that largely cares more about Palestinians? The governments of Bahrain, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates are balancing their relations with Israel and their people’s solidarity with Palestine. The Bahraini foreign ministry “stressed the need to immediately stop the ongoing fighting between the Palestinian Hamas movement and the Israeli forces.” Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita, in remarks to a session of the Arab League, acknowledged the “bloody and horrifying events that erupted on Saturday, October 7, 2023” and an Arab League resolution urged restraint, warning of “catastrophic repercussions, both human and security, of the continuation and expansion of the escalation.” The Emirati Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it “deeply mourns the loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives” and “stressed that attacks by Hamas against Israeli towns and villages near the Gaza Strip, including the firing of thousands of rockets at population centers, are a serious and grave escalation.”It would seem unlikely that those countries would break off or downgrade their diplomatic relations with Israel. What seems certain is that more Arab countries are not likely to normalize with Israel. The ongoing bombardment of Gaza, and a ground assault if one goes ahead, will undermine those prospects further.“In the short term, the normalization deal with Saudi Arabia is going to be delayed or face some level of obstacle,” El Kurd told me. “Because the whole point of them engaging on this topic is to say, ‘Oh, we’re going to meaningfully change Palestinian living conditions.’ I don’t think that’s within their ability to change, even marginally, at this point.”Now, one hopes that Biden’s advisers are watching protests in Arab capitals with a new understanding of the significance of Palestine to any Middle East policy. An approach to the region that does not take into account the mass, popular support for Palestinian rights — as has been on display since Biden took office — is not suited to reckon with realities on the ground. By focusing on solidifying Israel’s ties to Arab leaders, Biden has neglected to listen to Arab people.

"Hamas, the militant group that attacked Israel, explained",2023-10-10,Vox,['Nicole Narea'],"Filed under:What is Hamas and what does it want out of this new resurgence of violent conflict?An unprecedented surprise attack in southern Israel by Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, has led to an increasingly deadly conflict with no resolution in sight. Hamas launched its coordinated attack on southern Israel on October 7, firing rockets, invading Israeli towns and army bases, killing hundreds of people, many of them civilians, and taking Israelis hostage. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes in Gaza that have also killed hundreds of people, including civilians, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared war on Hamas, gearing up for a potential ground invasion. More than 1,500 people have died on both sides as of October 9. Hamas, designated by many nations as a terrorist organization, has been leading armed resistance against Israel for decades and also controls one of the two major political parties in Palestine. Though popular with some segments of Palestinian society, it remains highly divisive in Palestine and has often been at odds with more mainstream Palestinian politicians. While it has somewhat moderated its militancy since it assumed the responsibility of governing Gaza, it’s not clear what the future holds now that it has shown that it is still willing to risk provoking a major Israeli military operation to achieve its aim of Palestinian self-determination. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has vowed “mighty vengeance” on Hamas, seemingly with the objective of reducing its ranks to a point of impotence.Israel’s counterattack is intended to show “that it will be punitive partly for the sake of being punitive, and it will be aimed in part at destroying Hamas as an organization,” said Nathan Brown, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University. “It will definitely have an effect on Hamas as an organization, but it’s unclear … how successful it will be.”Here’s what you need to know about Hamas and its role in the latest eruption of fighting in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hamas was formed in 1987 as an outgrowth of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political group founded in Egypt in the late 1920s. Hamas, an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya (in English, Islamic Resistance Movement), was designed to provide an “Islamic alternative to the nationalist and leftist groups that then dominated the Palestinian scene in resistance to Israel,” Brown said.It rose to prominence during the first intifada, a Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. That uprising formally ended in 1993 with the signing of the Oslo Accords, an agreement between Israel and Palestine to lay the groundwork for the formation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, though that was never realized. In 1997, the US labeled Hamas a terrorist organization following its attacks, including suicide bombings, on Israeli targets. Other countries followed suit, though some, like New Zealand, have created a distinction between Hamas’s political wing and the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, its military division, viewing the former as legal and the latter as a terrorist group. Because the US views the whole group as terrorists, it cannot have direct diplomatic relations with Hamas, meaning any negotiations, including any peace negotiations, the US might want to hold have to be conducted through a third party. The group won a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006 over the secular Fatah movement, which has generally had better relationships with Western actors. Established by the Oslo Accords, the Legislative Council was meant to have authority over all of the occupied Palestinian territory — Gaza, where the current conflict is taking place, as well as the West Bank and East Jerusalem — but the 2006 election led to its demise.The international community refused to recognize the Hamas-led government, and Fatah refused to cede power to Hamas entirely. After the two parties failed to reach a lasting power-sharing agreement, a brief civil war broke out. Hamas defeated Fatah’s forces, and though the group’s democratically elected lawmakers were expelled from the legislative council, it took control of the Gaza Strip while Fatah kept control of the West Bank. In Gaza, Hamas continues to support social services and govern 2.3 million people who have been subject to highly restrictive blockades by Israel and Egypt that made the availability of basic goods and services very limited even before Israel’s recent counterattack. The need to manage millions of people changed Hamas, to some degree: “That responsibility made it contain ‘resistance’ and slow with any Islamic agenda, but it always made clear that this was a temporary outcome,” Brown said. For instance, while Hamas scaled back its aims of destroying Israel in a 2017 proclamation that tempered its rhetoric, it has continued to make clear that it wants to end what it calls a “racist, anti-human and colonial Zionist project” and take back much of the land that currently makes up the Israeli state.Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel seems to be a gamble that it can one day do so. Brown said that he thinks the strike, which saw somewhere between a few hundred and a couple thousand Hamas militants breach Israeli’s defenses, may have been an attempt by some in Hamas to “break the modus vivendi with Israel that had emerged over the years.” That status quo saw Israel violently contain Palestinian resistance in Gaza for years at comparatively little cost to its own people. Hamas’s assault may have also been a response to the perceived opportunity in Palestinian politics, with rising alienation and radicalization among youth, he said. Hamas remains a polarizing force in Palestinian society. While available data is limited, some research suggests that if a vote were to be held like the one in 2006, Palestinians would prefer Hamas’s leader to the deeply unpopular leader of the Fatah faction. At the same time, less than a third of Palestinians think the group deserves to represent them. There has not been an opportunity, however, for elections. As Vox’s Jonathan Guyer explained, “Palestinians living in Gaza must endure an unrepresentative government which imposes some Islamic tenets and implements repressive policies against LGBTQ people and abusive policies against detainees.”“Palestinians are deeply divided,” Brown said. “Some are members and strong supporters; some are sympathetic; some view it as problematic; some detest it. But most view it as part of the national fabric.”Hamas’s current political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and other Hamas leaders currently operate out of Qatar because Egypt restricts their movements in and out of Gaza. Hamas counts Iran as an ally, sharing an opposition to Israel and the United States’ role in the region. As Vox’s Ellen Ioanes reported, Iran has supported the development of Hamas’s rocket, missile, and mortar programs. It has also joined Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shia militant group based in southern Lebanon, in providing funding, training, and intelligence to Hamas fighters.But while Hamas has said that Iran supported its October 7 attack on Israel, “Hamas is not Iran’s proxy,” and its leadership and political agenda are distinct, Brown said.More generally, the question of where Hamas gets its funding is a bit complicated. Some of its money comes from taxes collected on goods smuggled through the Egyptian-Israeli blockade; other income streams include private international donors sympathetic to the group’s cause, and foreign aid, which helps it provide basic governmental services. Beyond Iran, Turkey and Qatar have been suspected of providing financial backing as well.At its core, Hamas wants an independent Palestinian state, one that, according to its 2017 manifesto, would at the very least include the land Palestinians held in 1967, a position Israeli governments have long said is out of the question. It also wants greater political power, both in Palestine and internationally. “Its ultimate goal is the liberation of all of historic Palestine, but Hamas has declared its willingness to reach a long-term cease-fire with Israel in exchange for full withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza and the creation of a Palestinian state,” Syracuse University Middle Eastern history professor Osamah Khalil told Vox.Hamas has a long track record of using armed resistance in order to achieve its aims, including conducting violent cross-border raids via tunnels and shooting rockets across the Gaza border. And as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp has explained, there’s a series of factors that may have contributed to Hamas’s decision to strike now — essentially, things the group wants to see stopped in the short term. Those include what the group described as Israeli settlers’ desecration of the al-Aqsa Mosque, a Muslim holy site near sites also holy to Christians and Jews; Israeli settlers’ growing attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank; and a potential security agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which would harm Palestine’s bid for independence. More broadly, some experts have argued this attack was intended to fundamentally shift how the world approaches Israeli-Palestinian relations — a show of force and strength by Hamas as it seeks to keep the fight for Palestinian independence at the forefront of international discussion. “Palestinian factions undertake operations like this one to keep the Palestine issue alive and to prevent any outside power from chipping away at the quest for Palestinian sovereignty,” said UCLA Middle Eastern history expert James Gelvin. “This is what Saudi-Israeli normalization threatens to do.” Experts have pointed to the potential Saudi deal, in particular, as a move that would have undercut Palestinians’ fight for statehood by further legitimizing Israel. Ultimately, Hamas is eager to maintain its own power and to keep the fight for a Palestinian state a chief priority for its allies abroad, including Arab countries like Qatar and Turkey. If Israel is launching brutal military attacks on Gaza and civilians, like those that killed dozens at markets, schools, and hospitals on Monday, it makes it much harder for other Arab countries to normalize their relationship with the country (though it also harms the people Hamas is meant to govern).As a Hamas spokesperson told Al Jazeera, these attacks were a decisive “message” to other Arab countries that they should not normalize ties with Israel.One other thing Hamas wants is for its vision for Palestine to win out over that of its chief rival, Fatah. Fatah, a reverse acronym for Harakat al-Tahrir al-Filistiniya (in English, Palestinian National Liberation Movement), is a secular party started in the 1950s that is also dedicated to establishing an independent Palestinian state.It’s currently the dominant party of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a group of 11 (mostly now defunct) organizations that was created in the 1960s in part to give Palestinians a voice on the world stage. The PLO currently runs the Palestine National Authority (PA), which is a government of semi-autonomous areas in parts of the West Bank. Fatah’s standing in Palestinian politics has been greatly weakened since its 2006 election loss to Hamas and subsequent infighting in the party. The PA is also presently led by President Mahmoud Abbas — the head of Fatah — and has faced significant scrutiny for failing to hold democratic legislative or presidential elections since 2006. Abbas has taken actions to consolidate his power in the absence of other elected lawmakers, further including reducing checks in the government’s three branches and cracking down on free speech.Hamas and Fatah differ most notably in their approach to recognizing Israeli statehood and in their approach to advocating for a Palestinian state. Fatah recognizes an Israeli state while Hamas does not. Fatah also supports diplomacy in its quest for an independent Palestinian state, while Hamas supports armed resistance in pursuit of this goal. Previously, Hamas was strongly against the Oslo Peace Accords the PLO struck unilaterally in the 1990s which put a stop to PLO violence alongside an agreement for a two-state solution. That deal also set up the PA, which has attempted and failed to reach multiple peace agreements with Israel.“Hamas sees the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank as a corrupt representative of the Palestinian cause and are considered political rivals, which has included fighting between armed elements of both sides in the past,” said Javed Ali, a University of Michigan national security expert.Support for the PA among Palestinians has dipped in recent years as it has offered limited condemnation and response to Israeli violence, especially ongoing settler violence that has seen Israelis take land by force. The PA has also suffered from weaker, aging leadership — one of Fatah’s founders, Yasser Arafat, led the PA until his death in 2004; Abbas, now 87, has been in charge since 2005. That has led many Palestinians, especially among the younger generation, to feel that Fatah is out of touch, and it has allowed Hamas to grow its backing among some who support its more aggressive focus on an independent state.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
18 provocative documentaries to look for this year,2020-03-14,Vox,['Alissa Wilkinson'],"Filed under:These thoughtful nonfiction films that played at the True/False Film Festival challenge our notions of reality, truth, and fiction.If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Every year, a handful of nonfiction films are selected to play at the annual True/False Film Festival in Columbia, Missouri, which is one of the most respected all-documentary festivals in the world. In three days, the festival pulls together some of the most exciting filmmaking in the country and packs out theaters to celebrate and explore what nonfiction film can do. For the most part, the festival skips the talking-head, issue-driven docs that dominate other festivals; instead, it’s a showcase for movies that challenge the audience in both form and content.The 2020 edition of the festival — its 17th — featured films from the US and abroad, with political, cultural, and social aims. Filmmakers discussed their work with festival attendees, the majority of whom hailed from mid-Missouri. The event, as always, was a confounding and delightful experience.Every movie that plays at True/False is worth seeing. But here are 18 of the most interesting films from the 2020 festival, and how you’ll be able to watch them in the months ahead.In the extraordinary Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets, documentarians and brothers Bill and Turner Ross chronicle the last night of service at a Las Vegas dive bar called Roaring ’20s — as regulars come and go, fight and kiss, and try to face the fact that the place that felt most like it was theirs will no longer exist. For them, it’s the end of the world.But there’s a catch: The Ross brothers used a real bar in New Orleans as a set and asked people to play characters much like themselves. Is the movie fiction? Yes, technically. Is it nonfiction? Not exactly. Is it “real”? Absolutely.Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets reminds us that we’re constantly reinventing and performing ourselves, even in our most comfortable, cherished settings — and cinema does, too.Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets is currently awaiting distribution.

  Boys State was one of the biggest success stories at Sundance, where it won the festival’s top documentary prize and broke the record for the highest acquisition price paid for a documentary, with A24 and Apple buying the film for $12 million. And no wonder: Not only is Boys State timely, but it’s also extremely entertaining. Documentarians Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine (The Overnighters) travel to Texas to follow the state’s 2018 summer session of a program called Boys State. Administered by the American Legion, Boys State is a gathering of more than 1,000 17-year-old boys who form a representative government, complete with party platforms and campaigns, to learn about how the American system of government works.In a sea of documentaries seeking to make sense of the divided and confusing political present, Boys State succeeds partly by setting itself one step removed from the “real world.” The teens come to Boys State with formed political ideas, but through debate, discussion, and defense of their stances, they learn a lot about what it takes to form consensus and win. And their experiences are both a microcosmic look into the political process and a hint of the way future politics might unfold, in dismal and strangely hopeful ways.Boys State will be released theatrically by A24 and on AppleTV+’s streaming service.Catskin opens with images of rotting fruit on a forest floor, shot with a texture and color that makes them look a bit like Renaissance still-life paintings. They’re both beautiful and repulsive, familiar and eerie, which matches the rest of the film. In Catskin, director Ina Luchsperger crafts a portrait of a Germany haunted by its past and its future by way of three generations, and it’s at once pastoral and frightening.To make the film, Luchsperger lived with a family in Bavaria for two years: a 13-year-old boy named Ludwig, his father Gunter, and his grandmother, who is also Luchsperger’s father’s first wife. (Luchsperger met the woman at her father’s funeral.) The film unfolds as a series of vignettes and conversations that slowly reveal a larger point. The grandmother, who lived through the war, loves her cats and worries for her son and grandson, who seem to be more and more enamored of the white nationalist ideology that’s growing in popularity in Bavaria. Meanwhile, Ludwig and Gunter both talk about their views, which are revealing about the ways that Germany’s reckoning with its Nazi past have, and haven’t, influenced its future. It’s a chilling, creepy, and often stunningly gorgeous film — a haunting look at the rot at the core of countries far beyond Germany.Catskin is currently awaiting distribution.Steve James knows Chicago; in several of his films, from the Oscar-nominated 1994 documentary Hoop Dreams to 2011’s The Interrupters to the 2018 docuseries America to Me, he’s explored the third-largest city in the US through the stories of its residents, often illuminating the complexities of bigger national issues by showing how ideas actually play out in individual lives. For City So Real, James focused on the groundbreaking 2019 Chicago mayoral election. The race featured a crowded field of candidates seeking to distinguish themselves and gain constituents’ trust against the backdrop of protests over the impending Lincoln Yards development project and the trial of police officer Jason Van Dyke, who shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times. It’s an engrossing portrait of a city — and a country — at an inflection point, and a love letter to Chicago, too.City So Real is currently awaiting distribution.In 2015, a fire in a Bucharest nightclub killed 27 people — and 37 more in the weeks that followed, due to shockingly inadequate hospital conditions that led to infections in the survivors. Collective — named in part for the nightclub, Colectiv, and in part for the film’s theme of systemic failure — is an observational documentary that traces the conditions and exposes huge deficiencies in the Romanian health care system as a whole.Documentarian Alexander Nanau captures the lies told by government officials during the fallout from the fire; eventually, their actions led to the government’s (short-lived) downfall. Collective plays out like a chilling, slow-moving train wreck, a study in how a government gaslights its citizens into accepting conditions that would be avoidable but for greed and corruption.Collective will be released by Magnolia Pictures and Participant Media on May 15. In a world where everything feels a little apocalyptic, Crestone comes off like a rhapsody for the end, a lullaby for a fading world. Director Marnie Ellen Hertzler sets out to visit a group of her old high school friends, stoners who moved to remote Crestone, Colorado, to grow weed and become Soundcloud rappers. They’re a band of merry dropouts, with dreams of a commune in the desert where everyone can live in peace and happiness.But they’re not off the grid — in fact, their constant construction of internet personas, mostly via Instagram, shapes their IRL personas, blurring what’s performance and what’s authentic. But is there even a difference? As fiction and nonfiction start to slip together, Hertzler captures the dreamy, mushy state of reality in their world, and in the world at large. In so doing, she suggests that this might be the end of reality as we know it, with life in their hazy world going on as the world outside Crestone burns.Crestone is currently awaiting distribution.Crip Camp starts out as a movie about a place. But then it becomes a chronicle of a movement, one sparked by the young people whose lives were changed by their experience in that place. The place is Camp Jened, a “summer camp for the handicapped run by hippies,” as former Jened camper James Lebrecht (and the film’s co-director, with Nicole Newnham) explains early in the film. Located in the Catskills a few hours north of New York City, Camp Jened was a place for teens with all kinds of disabilities (including those caused by polio and cerebral palsy) to spend time together and experience what it might be like to live in a world that was welcoming to them. Crip Camp focuses on a specific group of teens who attended the camp in the early 1970s (it closed due to financial difficulties in 1977) and later joined the radical disability rights movement. Many of them ended up in Berkeley as young adults, advocating for legislation that would require public places to be accessible to everyone, and that would prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities. The film shows how the vision the young people experienced at camp, of a world that was open to everyone, led them to become activists and community organizers. Crip Camp is buoyant and inspiring, a tale of people working together through difficulty and opposition to change the world.Crip Camp will stream on Netflix on March 25.

  In Dick Johnson Is Dead, documentarian Kirsten Johnson (Cameraperson) zooms in on her aging father and her relationship with him as they both begin to come to terms with his inevitable passing. The result is as playful as it is painful; in some sequences, Johnson stages her father’s arrival in heaven. In others, we’re not sure if we’re looking at something that really happened or something imagined.Some scenes are shot in cinema vérité style, as Dick plays with his grandchildren, packs up his office after retiring, and talks about his late wife, Kirsten’s mother, who had Alzheimer’s and died several years ago. The film — which won a prize for innovative filmmaking at Sundance — is an exercise in imagination and an inquiry into whether imagining the death of a loved one and their hopes for the hereafter might magnify or blunt the blow of death when it finally comes.Dick Johnson Is Dead will stream on Netflix later this year.

  In 2014, Akai Gurley, an unarmed 28-year-old black man, was shot in a Brooklyn housing project by Chinese American NYPD officer Peter Liang. Two years later, Liang became the first NYPD officer to be convicted in an officer-involved shooting since 2005; his conviction was eventually downgraded by a judge from manslaughter to criminally negligent homicide.Gurley’s death and Liang’s conviction became a flashpoint of conflict in New York, bringing to the fore a range of issues, from historic discrimination against Asian American communities to the ongoing history of black men shot by police to the way police interact with communities of color in the city. In Down a Dark Stairwell, director Ursula Liang (no relation) chronicles the case as it’s happening, exploring community discussions and protests, mobilization efforts, anger and cries for justice, and the results, which satisfied no one. It’s a vital picture of a tumultuous time and a gripping reminder that anyone promising to solve systemic racial issues probably needs a reality check.Down a Dark Stairwell is currently awaiting distribution.Director Khalik Allah’s first film, Field Ni**as, a vision of Harlem’s streets, sent shock waves through the documentary community when he dropped it on YouTube without warning in 2015, and it announced the arrival of a profound new filmmaking talent; his 2019 film Black Mother was among the year’s most-lauded documentaries. Allah has also worked as a photographer and a cinematographer (including on Beyoncé’s 2016 “visual album” for Lemonade, one of the best films of the 2010s).All of that has in some ways built to IWOW: I Walk on Water. The film is an expansive portrait of Harlem, mostly the people who populate the corners at night and, in particular, a man everyone calls Frenchy. It’s a sprawling, messy, and at times painfully personal work — it runs nearly three and a half hours — that weaves in Allah’s relationships with Frenchy, Allah’s mother, his girlfriend Camilla, and the people he encounters. Thanks to the director’s arresting, entrancing visual sense, watching IWOW is like entering a dreamscape inside Allah’s head, and being taken entirely out of yourself. It’s not for everyone, but it’s undeniably bold and fascinating.IWOW: I Walk on Water is currently awaiting distribution.In Germany, along the rural highways that lead to manufacturing plants, small RVs dot the roadside, sporting strings of colored lights in the windows and a woman in the front seat, waiting for customers. They’re the mobile vehicles that sex workers rent by the day, trying to earn a living by fulfilling the desires of the men who work nearby. Lovemobil, from director Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss, is an intimate look at two of the women who work in the vehicles — and a nuanced exploration of both how they began the work and why they’ve stayed in it. It’s unusually complex; the two women, one from Bulgaria and one from Nigeria, both have agency in choosing to do the work. But they want to get out of it, partly because of the abuse they encounter from some of their customers. Lehrenkrauss spent over a year with them, chronicling their conversations and recording their thoughts, and creating a vital, careful film that paints them as neither helpless victims nor empowered victors, but simply as women.Lovemobil is currently awaiting distribution.The city of Ramallah — Palestine’s de facto capital — sits near Jerusalem, surrounded by Israeli settlements and dependent on Israeli approval for public projects like constructing a cemetery. Mayor is a gripping portrait of Ramallah’s beloved mayor, Musa Hadid, whose job consists of the mundane tasks of running a local government mixed with the extraordinary circumstances of navigating the repercussions of a geopolitical conflict.That conflict came to the fore during the 2017 holiday season. Director David Osit was filming a fly-on-the-wall look at Hadid’s life when the Trump administration announced that it would be moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, thereby essentially declaring Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel. The controversial move sparked protests and violence across the country and in Ramallah, and Osit stayed with Hadid as he did his job. There are whiffs of Veep-like humor throughout Mayor (particularly with regard to a fountain outside the government building), but it’s also a sincere tale of a public servant who’s seeking to lead in a world that’s stacked against him.Mayor is currently awaiting distribution.You could call The Mole Agent a spy movie, but it’s an unusual one — and unusually poignant, too. Documentarian Maite Alberdi lets us in on a bit of subterfuge as Sergio, an elderly Chilean man, is “cast” as a new nursing home resident by Detective Romulo, who’s been hired to investigate the facility. Sergio’s job is to infiltrate the home on behalf of Romulo’s client and look into whether the client’s mother is being abused; meanwhile, the documentarians both follow Sergio and observe the home’s residents, who don’t know the whole truth about why Sergio is there. And what Sergio discovers is much bigger than one patient’s story and more insightful about love, loneliness, and growing old.The Mole Agent is currently awaiting distribution.So Late So Soon sneaks up on you. At first it’s a loving if quirky story about an aging couple: Jackie Seiden, an eccentric artist with a penchant for collecting detritus and discarded items, and Don Seiden, her husband, who makes giant sculptures from wire and foil. They clearly irritate one another and love one another, and their interactions make for a very funny film.But So Late So Soon (directed by Jackie’s former student Daniel Hymanson) evolves into something more heartbreaking, as the effects of aging on the couple’s health and relationship come into view. Jackie mourns that she, a “whirling dervish” obsessed with making art from decaying things, is herself decaying; Don struggles with newfound health problems that make living in their beloved home increasingly difficult. The result is moving and quietly devastating; it’s one of the best documentaries that played at this year’s True/False.So Late So Soon is currently awaiting distribution.In several previous films (including 2016’s critically acclaimed Starless Dreams), Iranian director Mehrdad Oskouei has explored the world inside Iran’s prisons for teenage girls convicted of serious crimes, including murder. He returns to that world for Sunless Shadows, in which he spends time with the girls as they live together, occupy themselves in the courtyard, laugh, eat, and try to live some kind of life behind thick walls.But the real subject of Sunless Shadows is the collection of circumstances that drove these teenagers — and often their mothers and older sisters, some of whom are living on death row, with sons pursuing their execution — to kill. Most often, they tell stories of years of serious physical and mental abuse at the hands of fathers, brothers, and brothers-in-law, experiences that finally drove them to the brink. Yet murder clearly wasn’t an act of “empowerment” for them; we bear witness as they beg for forgiveness and argue over whether they deserve any leniency. Humanist and sobering and enraging, Sunless Shadows is a vital portrait of young women in a society that has no room for them as people.Sunless Shadows is currently awaiting distribution.Heartbreaking and passionate, Time is the chronicle of a love deferred and the life that hope can provide. Garrett Bradley won the directing prize at Sundance for her documentary, which follows Fox Rich, a woman who has spent 21 years doggedly petitioning for the release of her husband Rob from prison. Rob is serving a 60-year sentence for a crime he committed as a young man, in which they were both involved.Meanwhile, she’s been raising their six children and becoming a powerful advocate for change in her community. And all along, Fox has filmed videos at home, which together feel like a diary of her pain and endurance. Time details her struggle, demonstrating how mass incarceration persistently separates black families in America as well as how bureaucracy and centuries of narratives about crime and justice conceal the truth and pain of those separations.Time will be released by Amazon.Israeli director Ra’anan Alexandrowicz has focused his films (like 2011’s The Law in These Parts) on questions about Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, but to explore the topic for The Viewing Booth, he focused his camera on the act of viewing itself. Alexandrowicz set up a lab-like room in which he invited American students interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to view videos uploaded by activists and verbalize their thoughts.He ended up centering the film on the reactions of one young woman, Maia Levy, an American of Israeli descent, whose views of videos originating in the West Bank city of Hebron stand in opposition to Alexandrowicz’s. Through their conversations, the ways our preconceived ideas shape and dictate the way we view the same images are explored and exposed, largely through Maia’s self-awareness of where her beliefs come from and why they won’t change. Even more extraordinarily, The Viewing Booth forces the audience into confrontation with their viewing biases. At one point we are watching Alexandrowicz watch Maia as she watches a video of herself watching another video; those levels of remove suddenly make us wonder how our own biases and beliefs shape what we’re looking at, too. The Viewing Booth is an outstanding probe into not just how people think about a conflict in the Middle East, but the limits of nonfiction films regarding their ability to persuade and explore reality as it is — and whether such a thing is even possible.The Waiting Booth is currently awaiting distribution.People who identify as LGBTQ+ experience opposition and difficulty all over the world.

Jared Kushner is giving disastrous Israel-Palestine peace plan interviews,2020-01-28,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:Kushner’s main talking point on the peace deal highlights the whole problem with it.Senior White House adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner spent three years working on the Trump administration’s newly released Israel-Palestine peace plan. Yet the main talking point he’s using to sell the proposal reveals the fundamental problem at the heart of the plan itself: the administration’s tacit endorsement of Israel’s continued illegal settlements in Palestinian territory.In multiple interviews right after the administration released its proposal on Tuesday, Kushner said Israel’s rapid growth — in other words, the settlements — are precisely why Palestinian leaders should make a deal now.“If we don’t do this today, at the rate at which Israel is growing, I think that it will never be able to be done,” Kushner told Al Jazeera. “So we see this as the last chance for the Palestinians to have a state.” He didn’t misspeak, which we know because he repeated this same talking point over an hour later. “This is something that we inherited, the situation where Israel continues to grow and grow,” he told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.Let’s be clear about what this means: The White House’s lead staffer for finding a peaceful solution to the Israel-Palestine stalemate says Israel’s growth is basically unstoppable. For that reason, he claims, Palestine has no choice but to strike a deal.It’s an astounding thing for Kushner to say. Israel restrains itself from extending its settlements into the West Bank unless it feels it has tacit American approval. Kushner’s plan and his statements will likely serve as a green light to Israeli leadership to expand those settlements. They may explain why Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu wants a vote on Sunday to annex 30 percent of the West Bank.That could make a fraught issue so much worse. About 500,000 Israelis live in the settlements, of which there are about 130 scattered around the West Bank. Roughly 75 percent of settlers live on or near the West Bank border with Israel. Some of the settlements are vast communities that house tens of thousands of people and look like suburban developments. Some look like hand-built shanty outposts.Settlements create what Israelis and Palestinians call “new facts on the ground.” Palestinian communities are split apart and their connection to the land weakened, while Jewish communities put down roots in territory meant for Palestinians. In effect, it shrinks the area of land left available for any future Palestinian state to exist on and chops it up into pieces, destroying its potential viability as a real, contiguous state. For some settlers, this is the point: They want the West Bank fully incorporated as Israeli territory and are trying to make that happen.A “conceptual map” of Palestine released as part of Kushner’s proposal shows he wants some of those settlements to remain where they are (they’re the flecks of beige interspersed among the blueish green parts). Instead of coming up with a plan that would see those settlers relocated or finding some other solution, Kushner’s plan just takes the huge chunk of land where most of the settlements are located and gives it to Israel. In return, Palestinians get some pockets of land far away in the desert on the border with Egypt and not much else.Which means one of two things: either Kushner doesn’t know how sensitive this issue is, or he doesn’t care and is using it as a cudgel against Palestinians. It’s hard to know which one is worse.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Biden came and went to Israel. What comes next?,2023-10-18,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Biden has avoided Middle East peacemaking. Now, it’s the only path forward.President Joe Biden’s quick visit on Wednesday to wartime Israel was designed as a show of support for the close US ally, one that inspired confidence in Israel as it pursues its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza. His presence, it was thought, would calm things down.  But that only addresses one side of the conflict. If Biden fails to do everything he can to curtail the violence now, say analysts and insiders, his visit may ultimately damage the United States’ standing in the Middle East and its ability to lead in the world. That’s because the short-, medium-, and long-term implications of Israel’s operation against Gaza, should it continue unabated, will be much worse than the political risks Biden would need to take to secure a ceasefire and invest in a sustainable political resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As Biden boarded the plane to Israel on Tuesday, an explosion at Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City killed at least 471 people. The cause remains unclear and hotly disputed; the Gaza Health Ministry blamed an Israeli strike, while Israel pointed the finger at the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The White House National Security Council released a rare statement on its intelligence-gathering, largely siding with Israel: “our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday.” In any case, that preliminary conclusion, which has yet to be independently verified, will do nothing to contain the massive demonstrations in the Arab world sparked by the fatal explosion, as well as the ongoing bombing of Gaza. Even as Biden was en route to Israel, anger over the deaths also led Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestine Liberation Organization to cancel a planned summit in Amman that would have been the second leg of his trip. That Egypt and Jordan — close security partners of the US  — would snub Biden was a major embarrassment for the president. In Israel, though, Biden spoke more forwardly about Palestinian rights than he had previously, stating clearly that “we mourn the loss of innocent Palestinian lives.” He pledged $100 million of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza. But even that shift contrasted with the US’s efforts at the United Nations, where US diplomats vetoed a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause in the fighting. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said it would undermine the US’s diplomatic initiatives in the conflict.“It’s clear that they don’t have a full appreciation for the humanitarian disaster unfolding before us in Gaza,” Khaled Elgindy of the Middle East Institute told me. Palestinians “have been completely stripped of their humanity, and that’s been normalized.”Elgindy’s recommendations for the Biden administration are straightforward. “Call for a ceasefire,” he explained. “Tell Israel to turn the lights back on. Electricity, water, food — all of that should be unlimited. Don’t push people out of Gaza. Don’t let Israel go in on the ground. Put some guardrails and clear red lines about protecting civilians.” Elgindy calls these policies “obvious, minimal stuff” that might have been possible under previous administrations. But the sheer scale of Hamas’s attacks on October 7 and the ongoing hostage crisis, as well as significant fractures within the domestic politics of Israel, Palestine, and the United States, can make even minimal policies seem impossible.But if the unprecedented scale of human suffering among Palestinians doesn’t get the attention of Washington policymakers, then perhaps the potential for massive blowback across the Arab world will make the difference. Former US officials who were involved in the Iraq War are already proposing ideas for Gaza’s postwar planning, including reviving the Palestinian Authority’s administration of Gaza. But the focus on the day after misses what is happening to Palestinians right now. “Nobody knows what the day after is because nobody knows what the day of is,” Elgindy told me. Israel itself has not articulated its goals beyond getting rid of Hamas, which seems to contradict the vast human toll Palestinians in Gaza are experiencing. The experts I called are particularly concerned that the lack of a strong US perspective on that question is effectively enabling a military campaign based on revenge, not a bigger strategy. “If Israel’s going to ask the world to support it as it does what it feels it needs to do to root out Hamas, that support should be contingent on understanding what its plan is at the back end,” Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the liberal Israel advocacy group J Street, told me. Without such clarity, the risks of the war spilling into other countries only grows. And it is dire. Arab citizens came out to protest en masse in the middle of the night in capitals across the Middle East, and Arab governments appear frustrated with Biden’s tepid response to the situation in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon poses a particularly acute danger should it get involved. And Lebanese citizens are already holding America responsible. Protesters outside the US Embassy in Beirut — an intensely fortified compound — threw rocks and lit fires. “We’re officially off the rails at this point,” Zaha Hassan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told me.Adjusting the administration’s language to humanize Palestinians is an important first step, said Hassan. And the Biden administration is slowly and cautiously tweaking its rhetoric. “Civilian lives must be protected and assistance must urgently reach those in need,” the White House said in a statement announcing the $100 million of aid.But nothing can move forward without a ceasefire, Hassan says, and without urgent humanitarian relief reaching Palestinians in Gaza, where there have been 3,478 fatalities, 12,500 injuries, and 1 million internally displaced people as of October 18, according to the UN.Only a bigger strategic rethink that focuses on a resolution to the core conflict between Israelis and Palestinians will bring security to the people there. “The festering nature of the Palestinian issue is what brought us to this moment,” Hassan told me. Beyond appointing an envoy to address the humanitarian situation, “the administration needs to start thinking about rolling up its sleeves, and starting to think about how it’s going to build an international or a multilateral coalition of folks to work on a political solution.”President Biden came into office with a team of advisers who were adamant that the US could focus on countering China and Russia in the world, and finally pivot away from the Middle East.Ten days of unprecedented war have shown how farcical that was. Biden has said before that when it comes to domestic policy, he’s all about going big. Foreign policy is trickier — there’s not a strong domestic constituency for radically changing US statecraft, and the inertia of carrying on with outdated policies is difficult to escape.But the Israel-Hamas war exposes a basic truth: Ignoring Palestine, as both the US and Israel have been guilty of doing, will make the Middle East more combustible. “There’s no way for this spiraling cycle of never-ending violence to ever end if there isn’t a state of Palestine,” Ben-Ami of J Street told me. Ben-Ami said that Biden could recalibrate his message. “I think there’s a space here for the president, and perhaps it’s in concert with other world leaders, to articulate where they think things have to go when the fighting stops,” he told me. “And I think that may be important to put out there, even as the fighting is ongoing.” (J Street, for its part, hasn’t called for a ceasefire, and 100 former members of the advocacy group have urged it to do so.)What Palestinians need is not more economic peace, the main focus of the remarkably unambitious policy of outgoing US ambassador to Israel Tom Nides. And it’s not empty talk of a two-state solution that seems further than ever from reality. “Out of this rubble and out of this disaster, the world has to be committed to actually building a real state” for Palestinians, Ben-Ami said. “That may be a 20-year Marshall Plan–style investment, and it means not only rebuilding the physical infrastructure and building out an economy, but building a viable political structure.”As Biden himself put it in Tel Aviv, “We must keep pursuing a path so that Israel and the Palestinian people can both live safely, in security, in dignity, and in peace.”Waiting at the trailhead of that path, however, will only make the situation worse. “Neglect isn’t going to make these things go away, and it’s a very explosive situation,” Hassan said. Though Biden has largely stayed out of the Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking game, he can no longer avoid it.

The Israel-Hamas war reveals how colleges lost their way on free speech,2023-11-05,Vox,['Fabiola Cineas'],"Filed under:A First Amendment lawyer argues the university’s role in a crisis should be shutting up.The Israel-Hamas war has brought the long-simmering debates over free speech on college campuses to a boiling point.If school leaders released statements, they were criticized — for not denouncing Hamas and antisemitism or for ignoring the Palestinian plight. On campus, both Jewish and Palestinian students say they aren’t getting support from administrators and staff. Campus protests have put pressure on school leaders to choose a side or curb student speech and behavior. Emotions and fears are running high: Jewish students and student groups say they are fearful of antisemitism on campus. Palestinian students say they are facing Islamophobia and racism. Students who signed petitions that critics say supported Hamas in the wake of its October 7 attack are losing career opportunities or have been publicly named and investigated. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]The leading group advocating for free speech on campus argues that the problem is not that universities are doing too little to stifle hateful speech; it’s that they have already done too much. Amid the major social and political catastrophes of the past decade, higher education institutions have strayed away from their mission: to foster dialogue and the flow of different ideas, said Alex Morey, the director of the campus rights advocacy program at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE). Sometimes the free flow of dialogue can be uncomfortable, and FIRE often defends statements and individuals who are unpopular. Even as people on and off campus fear that heated rhetoric will lead to an increase in Islamophobic or antisemitic violence, Morey argues colleges should not stop their students from making statements that many find deeply upsetting or even dangerous. Instead, she said, colleges should focus on creating a safe environment where even jarring, hurtful, or racist notions can be discussed and debated.It’s a lot to grapple with, and I talked to Morey about it all: school statements, student protests, faculty speech, whether words are violence, and why certain students are under more scrutiny than others. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. What’s your broad assessment of how the conflict in the Middle East is playing out on college campuses?The zoom-out assessment is that it’s a really divisive topic. It’s a big controversy, whether you are looking at it on the ground in the Middle East, or if you are on a college campus. Wherever people are talking about what’s going on with Israelis and Palestinians, this is a hot-button issue. Lots of people want to express their opinions about it, so it’s no surprise that on college campuses, we are seeing the same level of passion from students and faculty as we’re seeing from anybody who is confronting this long-running and really intractable conflict. [Related: The boycott movement against Israel, explained]That said, FIRE is always urging colleges and universities and members of those communities, whether you’re a student or the president or a faculty member, to recognize the university’s very special role when it comes to confronting these problems. [Universities] are not corporations. [School leaders] are not politicians.We have found in recent years that universities are acting a lot more like corporations when it comes to making statements about big political and social issues. They’re worrying about, “Well, how does this look for the brand?” or “If there’s controversy on campus, is that going to make legislators mad at us and take away our funding?” The focus has been removed from what we think is the core mission of the university, which is to foster debate and discussion. It is to welcome not just a diversity of students and faculty and help them thrive, but to also embrace a diversity of views. The college campus is the place to have people’s different authentic views come together, where we can have discussions in a scholarly and civil way. That isn’t a top priority for many universities, it seems, and that is a big mistake. The Israel-Hamas conversation has seemed to wake administrators up, at least a bit, to the realization that if they continue their practice of taking firm sides on political and social issues, they will, repeatedly, arrive at places like this, where there are conflicts on which there is no “right” side. You’re saying universities should not have come out to comment on Hamas’s attack on Israel or on Israel’s continued bombardment of Gaza. But we are now past that point at many schools, as you acknowledged. Now some students and faculty members are facing consequences as part of this environment you describe in which universities are trying to be arbiters of right and wrong when it comes to speech and actions. In light of this, what are the foundational speech protections that students, faculty, and school leaders have on campus for speaking out on this issue?It depends on whether or not you’re on a public or private campus. Public campuses have to follow the First Amendment, which means students and faculty have broad First Amendment rights. Students can express their views on anything on campus. They can protest. They can hand out leaflets, or, in line with the university’s posting policies, hang up posters. They have broad First Amendment rights that would apply to anyone in society when they’re speaking off campus in their free time and in many of the areas on campus. There are exceptions for in the classroom. They can’t get up in the middle of class and be screaming or something because faculty also have First Amendment rights, including the right to academic freedom, which entails, among other things, the right for them to control their classroom. Faculty also have strong academic freedom rights, which is like a corollary of the First Amendment, to make extramural commentary. That means that on their own time they can talk about things that are related to issues of public concern. So something as politically dicey as what’s happening in the Middle East is an incredibly important issue of public concern. Administrators actually have fewer rights. Of course they have their rights as citizens when they’re off the clock, but because they are effectively employees of the university, their speech can be restricted in ways that we don’t see for faculty and students, who have much broader rights.Private campuses that make free speech and academic freedom promises in their mission statements, which is most of them, have to keep those promises. These promises all basically say our students and faculty have free speech rights commensurate with the First Amendment. And how does counterspeech fit into that framework of protections?Counterspeech is super important. The vision of the First Amendment is not just that people are allowed to say anything without the government suppressing it. It’s this idea that if we all talk together, we will have better outcomes for society. When somebody raises an idea that might be unpopular or wrongheaded or offensive, the idea is that other people will then lend their voices through counterspeech and say, “I disagree with that idea and here’s why. Here’s why my idea is better.” That gets complicated in practice. There are some nuances that are really important, that illustrate how universities could be doing a better job of explaining this to students and faculty and deans who are in charge of making sure different speaking events and protests go off without a hitch. One is that when students are speaking in open outdoor areas of campus, areas that function like a public square, if a heated back-and-forth occurs between students, that’s protected speech. We’ve been seeing this a lot in recent weeks, where there might be a pro-Israel protest on the quad and a pro-Palestinian student comes up and says, “You all are a bunch of jerks!” This is all protected as long as there is no physical altercation or true threat, which has a specific legal definition. Then another situation we often see these issues raised is when it comes to invited speakers or situations where a student group has reserved a space for a speaker or their members to speak. There’s been a lot of confusion about, “Well, can’t a protest group come marching through this speech and shout it down? Isn’t that our free speech?” The Supreme Court has firmly said no, that’s called a heckler’s veto. It means if there is a particular forum that has been reserved for a particular type of speech, those students who are putting on that speaker or who are speaking, have the right to control that forum until they’re done speaking. What those protesters can do instead of censoring the speech is have space nearby outside the venue where they can protest contemporaneously. Universities should support that kind of exchange and teach students it’s not actually free speech to shout down the speaker. They should facilitate that exchange of ideas. Relatedly, actions like ripping down posters also typically are not protected expression. Blocking access to or egress from buildings, trespassing, incitement — where you’re actively, intentionally encouraging someone to go commit a crime imminently and it’s likely that they will do it — those things are not protected. Most of what we see on campus is just students and some of the faculty having really heated debates and expressing opinions that a lot of people find hateful and offensive and that, without more, is all protected.But I feel like since 2020, a facet of our society now — and this especially plays out on college campuses — is that students look to administrators’ and leaders’ messages to feel safe. There’s the example of how after 9/11, hate crimes against Muslims decreased after President Bush said that America will not tolerate Islamophobia. I spoke to the folks at Hillel International who told me Jewish students on campus don’t feel safe because they don’t believe they have the support of school leadership. A lawyer at Palestine Legal told me Muslim students don’t feel supported right now. And when they say support, it’s not necessarily like, are there more officers on campus to protect our safety, but it’s like, what is the administration communicating in its statement that can help us feel safe?This is probably the most important change that we need to see on campuses if we are going to have the kind of speech and debate climate that’s ideal in these university spaces.There’s been a lot of research about how this generation of students is dealing with more mental health issues than in other generations. One reason is these students have had very intensive parenting that didn’t expose them to views or ideas that could upset them. Now when they get to campus, they have similar expectations, that they can go to someone to say, “Fix this for me, I’m upset.” But universities really need to help teach them that words and ideas are incredibly powerful, but so are they. They can confront a lot of these ideas with confidence.They need the skills to understand, “Why is it important to listen to people that I might not agree with? What are the contours of listening to an idea that I disagree with? I am actually strong enough to be able to handle that, and, in fact, it’s so much better than when these ideas have to be pushed underground and they fester, that they turn into actual violence.” There are benefits of genuinely confronting these ideas. We need to help students learn that while words and ideas are incredibly powerful, not only are they not “violence,” but, in fact, they’re the opposite of violence. And they are the best way that we, as humans, have ever devised to work out our problems without killing each other or without jailing each other.Is all speech being treated the same right now? Are students who are speaking out in support of Israel being treated the same as students who speak out for Palestinian rights?It depends on who you ask. That’s the heart of all of the discussion of “hate speech” right now. Like, if you say, “Free Palestine,” then you must mean that you’re pro-Hamas. Or if you say, “release the hostages,” then that must mean you are cool with genocide in Gaza. Of course, it’s much more nuanced than that. A lot of people are justifying not wanting to talk to each other because they think these are just war criminals on both sides.From a First Amendment perspective, there should be no value judgment on speech other than is it protected or not. And when we’re asking that question, we’re asking, should the government or the institution that promises First Amendment commitments, should we put them in charge of deciding which is the appropriate view to have on Israel-Palestine? We think the key to navigating these incredibly divisive and polarized times that are now in front of us, unlike any time in the past, is to have universities not take a stance on these issues for exactly the reason you raise. At the University of Arizona recently, the president came out saying, “We condemn Hamas.” He also basically said, “I’m really nervous about the [Students for Justice in Palestine] chapter on our campus speaking up about Palestine and liberation, they’re going to do a rally on our campus and they have the right to do that, but I don’t really like it. It doesn’t align with our values.” Then SJP immediately canceled the rally and said they didn’t feel safe doing it on campus. That was a grave situation in which nobody’s First Amendment rights were violated since everybody who was speaking and counterspeaking had the right to do that. But when that speech is coming from the institution itself, an institution that is supposed to embrace all views, the effect is that some views can be marginalized. We’re seeing many situations of students being investigated, like Ryna Workman, who lost her big law job for saying Israel bears responsibility for the loss of life in Israel. NYU said they are investigating her. We are definitely seeing the pro-Palestinian type of speech being less popular writ large on many campuses. One thing universities can do to signal that they are not elevating some protected speech over other protected speech is for the institution itself to not start from a place of bias.You mention that students who are articulating pro-Palestinian views are being disproportionately challenged on their speech. Why do you think that is?It’s probably because the pro-Palestinian students do feel more like the minority on most campuses, and because often they are. And so they feel less empowered and less supported by the university. If universities had come out and said, “We stand with the people of Gaza. End genocide now,” it might be a totally different situation where Palestinian students were feeling like their speech is the one that is important on campus. And then in broader society, we’re not seeing employers take people’s jobs because they condemned Hamas. The people that stand with Gaza, they’re the ones losing their jobs. The US government is fully behind Israel. Beyond campus, there’s this sense that most people are generally pro-Israel at this moment. So students who are pro-Palestine probably feel like their speech is unpopular and we’re seeing that play out on campuses. I don’t think we’ve yet had a situation where a pro-Israel student or professor is facing some kind of censorship attempt from the university. I could be mistaken but there’s lots coming from the other direction.What’s your assessment of how campus protests have played out? They appear to have gotten heated, with clashes between dueling protests. Jewish students are fearful that some pro-Palestine rallies have been antisemitic. There have been images of students with signs that say “keep the world clean” accompanied by an image of the Israeli flag in the trash. Palestinian students and advocates report being shut down. It’s all protected, as long as that’s all there is. As long as there is no true threat. What is a true threat in this context? A true threat is a serious expression of an intent to commit unlawful violence that’s targeted toward a person or a specific group of people, like “Those people over there, we’re going to do something bad to them.” It’s a very high bar, so even stuff that people find very offensive or wrongheaded, like the Star of David in the trash can, is all protected unless there is some kind of substantial step that moves it toward meeting that true threat threshold. And how are incitement and discriminatory harassment different?Incitement is a statement in which the speaker is asking people to commit an unlawful act of violence. Again, it has to be targeted in the way that a true threat would need to be targeted, and it also has to be likely to occur. A lot of this generalized, very heated rhetoric around Israel and Palestine is not going to meet that high bar. It’s the same with discriminatory harassment. In higher ed, discriminatory harassment is only those unwelcome statements that are so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive. It is typically repetitive, targeted conduct or speech that is so serious that it deprives the victim of their ability to get an education at the university. So just walking around campus seeing a poster [with hateful language], that’s going to be upsetting. That’s going to make you want to speak out and counter that, but you can just walk away and still go to class.Of course, universities can speak to campus communities and say, “Look, to the extent that our Jewish or Palestinian students are feeling unsupported or are worried that some of this speech might devolve into violence, here are the steps we’re taking.” And those steps can include ramping up security, providing the contact information for campus safety, and providing mental health resources, other health resources. Universities can do what they can to make sure that they are creating a campus that’s not a tinderbox for violence. But beyond that, it is very important under the First Amendment that colleges and universities not try to sanitize or civilize a lot of this speech that is heated and passionate for a reason. I am still trying to understand how really antisemitic or racist or Islamophobic/anti-Palestinian statements are akin to saying “Fuck the draft,” particularly in this climate.It’s a tough one. But I’ve got the answer for you. A lot of people are saying “hate speech isn’t protected speech.” But hate speech is protected speech because there is no legal definition of hate speech.Israel thinks the Palestinians are engaging in hate speech and the Palestinians think Israel is engaging in hate speech. And who’s right? We can’t know. That’s sort of the idea that’s embraced by the First Amendment, that one man’s vulgarity is another man’s lyric. Another example is stomping on the American flag. Some people think that we can all agree that stomping on the American flag is unpatriotic and hateful. But you could argue that the person stomping on the American flag loves America too, but maybe they don’t love how it’s being run right now and it’s their First Amendment right to raise those concerns. The key Supreme Court case that talks about hate speech and why it has to be protected is Snyder v. Phelps, which is the Westboro Baptist Church case in which the church was outside military funerals with signs and shirts that said, “Thank God for dead soldiers” and “Fag troops.” The parents of some of these soldiers sued the church since they believed that the speech was so disgusting. The families believed that that kind of hate speech wasn’t protected. But the Supreme Court unanimously said the church’s speech is protected. It’s because speech is so powerful. It can make people very upset. It can prompt people to do things and make change and raise their own voices in protest. In the US, we have a unique commitment to leaving debate as wide open as possible so that we don’t stifle debate.Are there international comparisons that help us illustrate why America is so committed to protecting speech, even if it’s hate speech? There have been attempts in other countries, [in] Europe, France and Germany, in particular, to pass antisemitism laws that make it illegal to say stuff like “I hate the Jews.” But there are a couple of interesting things about those antisemitism laws, about how they don’t work. One, we have seen uneven implementation of those laws. For example, when the Charlie Hebdo newsroom was shot up because they were making fun of the Prophet Muhammad, a lot of Muslims were saying they’ve been talking about issues that are important in the Muslim community but were being targeted under the antisemitism law. There have been Muslims put in jail for violating the antisemitism law when they were making statements like, “Maybe I can see why some of these Muslims are acting in violent ways.” Muslims have been jailed in France for that, but the Charlie Hebdo staff were making fun of Muslims and it was no big deal. Separately, Germany has some of the strictest antisemitism laws, where you can’t make certain statements about Jews. And they’ve also got the biggest underground growing ultra-right Nazi crisis — that German authorities can’t keep track of — in the world because we don’t know where these Nazis are. They can’t say this stuff, but they still hold those views. There’s the sense right now that this kind of hate speech is widespread, that students all across America are engaging in some kind of charged speech that is disrupting the ability of campuses to function right now. And the war in the Middle East is only intensifying. Is it the case that speech is getting worse on campuses because it is going unchecked?I think, broadly, those kinds of very extreme statements are not rampant on college campuses. I know we have seen an uptick in this really heated rhetoric in the last few weeks. But a lot of the pushback that I get during this free speech work is like, well, if we allow speech to be that free, then KKK groups are going to be popping up on campuses everywhere. That is not happening. Most people are decent people who want to have these conversations, so universities should be fostering them rather than taking action to silence students.Can you talk about why you believe it feels so charged to call someone antisemitic right now, or to call someone a Zionist? Students are saying they’re afraid of being called one or the other, or are being called terrorists or terrorist sympathizers. Are these terms being weaponized in some way and why? The zeitgeist for many people is to take a single view that someone might have and extrapolate that to an extreme, and say, “Well, if you believe this one thing then you must believe all these other things.” People are seeing that happening, and they’re very worried about being misunderstood. I don’t think there’s a lot of recognition in the world right now that people are more than just one particular view. We’re nuanced, complicated creatures. We’re afraid of what’s happening in our world right now and we want to be in our little boxes and look for any signal from other groups that they might be a danger to us.

The world’s largest child displacement crisis is in Sudan,2023-11-08,Vox,['Bryan Walsh'],"Filed under:While attention is rightly focused on the catastrophe in Gaza, millions elsewhere are suffering — and the world doesn’t seem to care.
    Finding the best ways to do good. 
  Back in May, Al Jazeera published a story about a Palestinian man named Adel Atallah. In 2007, Atallah left his native Gaza to escape the Israeli blockade, joining relatives who were living in Sudan, which has long had diplomatic relations with Palestine. He found a job in construction in the capital city of Khartoum, got married, and had five children. Atallah built, as he told Al Jazeera, “a stable life.”But after a civil war broke out in Sudan this past April, Atallah decided that he and his family had to leave. “The situation exploded suddenly, and then things escalated until it became crazy,” he told Al Jazeera. “The sound of bullets and gunfire did not stop around us. Even corpses were on the streets.” So for the second time in his life, Atallah fled violence and chaos. His destination? Gaza.I wonder what’s become of Atallah and his family, and the hundreds of other Palestinians who left Sudan in the spring to come to what was, at the time, the comparative safety of Gaza. They had no way of knowing that their refuge would become what the UN is now calling an “unfolding catastrophe” in the midst of an unprecedented war with Israel, where as many as 10,000 people have been killed so far. Even before the war, Gaza faced the risk of military action from neighboring Israel and was often described as an “open-air prison,” which gives you a sense of just how bad things were in Sudan when Palestinians began leaving. But unlike the one in Gaza, Sudan’s humanitarian crisis has largely escaped the world’s attention.The civil war in Sudan, which pits forces loyal to the country’s de facto ruler, army Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, against the paramilitary leader Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, began when fighting broke out on April 15 in the country’s capital of Khartoum. Since then, at least 9,000 civilians have been reported killed and more than 12,000 injured, though the true number is likely far higher. Each week, we explore unique solutions to some of the world's biggest problems.Check your inbox for a welcome email.Fighting in Khartoum and in the western region of Darfur — which had already been subject to genocidal violence, leading to the deaths of as many as 300,000 people over the past two decades — has led to a horrific humanitarian crisis. Some 4.8 million people — more than a 10th of Sudan’s population — have been displaced internally, while more than a million Sudanese have fled to neighboring countries like Chad and Egypt.Children, as always, are bearing the brunt of the suffering. Just this week, even as Israel’s bombs continued to fall upon Gaza, UNICEF issued a report calling Sudan the “largest child displacement crisis in the world,” with more than 3 million children forced to flee their homes and 14 million children in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance. With classrooms closed since the war began, an estimated 19 million children are out of school — a devastating situation in a country where the median age is just 18 years old. More than 70 percent of the country’s healthcare facilities have been forced to close, contributing to deaths from cholera, malaria, dengue, and childbirth in a nation that already had some of the world’s highest rates of maternal mortality even before the war. Refugees are at risk of sexual violence and even slavery; children have been forcibly recruited into the armed forces. It is a state, as UNICEF put it, of “perpetual fear.”“We cannot allow the death and suffering of millions of children in Sudan to become another forgotten humanitarian catastrophe,” UNICEF said in its report on Monday. And yet that is precisely what is happening. It is a mistake to attempt to weigh one atrocity against another. The death of a child, the loss of a mother, is a tragedy no matter where it occurs. The suffering in Sudan should in no way subtract from the pain in Gaza, or, for that matter, the deaths of some 1,400 people in Israel slaughtered by Hamas on October 7. One of the truths that we hold here is that all lives, and all deaths, should have equal value.Yet the attention the world pays to these crises has been far from equal and has little connection to the scale of the tragedies. With 46 million people, Sudan’s population is more than three times that of the combined number of people living in Israel and the Palestinian territories. When a crisis like this civil war comes to a country of this size, one where an estimated 35 percent of people are living on less than $2.15 a day, the humanitarian consequences are proportionately terrible.Nor is Sudan the only massive humanitarian crisis involving mass numbers of refugees occurring largely outside the world’s attention. In Pakistan, up to 1.7 million Afghan refugees — many of whom were born or have lived in Pakistan for decades as they sought shelter from years of war and upheaval in their native country — are facing expulsion after a government order to remove undocumented people. Those who return to Afghanistan will find themselves in an impoverished country once again run by the ultra-fundamentalist Taliban, where one of the worst earthquakes in memory killed thousands of people last month. Afghanistan, of course, is a country that was once at the center of global attention, thanks to the long American military involvement after 9/11. Sudan, too, had its moment in the spotlight in the aughts, when fears of genocide in Darfur turned the country into a cause celebre. And then those moments passed.At this moment, it might seem impossible that the same could happen to Gaza. In nearly a quarter-century as a working journalist, including multiple years running foreign news coverage, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a story seize the world’s attention, nor divide it so sharply, as the war in Gaza, accelerated in part by the growth of social media platforms that weren’t as widespread in previous iterations of the crisis. We aren’t helpless in the face of such catastrophes. Money, as always, matters, and we’re falling short there — the UN has said it had only received 33 percent of the $2.6 billion it requires to deliver needed humanitarian aid to Sudan. And global attention, even if it isn’t flawless — the record of the Save Darfur campaign had its share of failures — can be a powerful motivator to force positive action, as the wildly successful movement to push the US to supply HIV drugs to Africa demonstrates. Yet as the examples of Sudan or Afghanistan — or, for that matter, Ukraine, now struggling for attention as its war drags into a third year — all demonstrate, global attention and outrage can be fleeting. But the suffering endures.A version of this newsletter originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

Democratic voters are divided on whether Biden should crack down on Israel,2021-06-08,Vox,['Jerusalem Demsas'],"Filed under:Biden’s position toward Israel hasn’t changed, but the Democratic Party has.The split in the Democratic Party on US policy toward Israel and Palestine isn’t just among politicians — it’s among their voters as well.In a new poll with Vox and Data for Progress, Democratic voters are divided on whether President Joe Biden’s administration should be harsher toward the Israeli government. The poll, which had a 3 percent margin of error, was conducted from May 19 to 21 among 1,319 likely voters. In it, after being given a short summary of how Biden responded to the crisis last month, 32 percent of Democrats say they believe “the administration should condemn Israel’s actions.” Meanwhile, 39 percent agreed “the administration has the right approach to Israel.” Only 11 percent of Democrats believe that the administration should be more supportive of Israel.  By the time the poll was being fielded, the New York Times reported that more than 200 people had died in the latest round of fighting, “the vast majority of them Palestinians killed by Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip.” The conflict heightened after Israel worked to evict Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem. The Biden administration quietly advocated for a ceasefire, but not forcefully enough, some critics said; the White House condemned violence by Hamas but said it did not find Israel’s attacks disproportionate.Republican responses to some of the questions are more uniform. For instance, more than 60 percent believe that “Biden is not supportive enough of Israel,” and 60 percent agree that the administration should condemn Hamas further. As Vox’s Alex Ward has explained, there is a growing divide on US policy toward Israel within the Democratic Party that became more visible in the last month. That’s partly because former President Donald Trump’s posture toward Israel was remarkably conciliatory, which can help explain why a once bipartisan approach has become more complicated among Democrats:As president, Trump gave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nearly everything he wanted, including recognition of Israeli sovereignty over disputed territory like the Golan Heights, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, and a “peace plan” that fulfilled nearly all of the premier’s wish list. Meanwhile, Trump closed a Palestinian political office in Washington, DC, stopped aid to the West Bank and Gaza, and effectively cut ties with top Palestinian officials.Some of the party’s younger, more diverse, and more progressive lawmakers have also elevated questions about support for Israel and pointed to the plight of the Palestinian people.Biden, however, seems not to have moved along with his party. Just last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, “We have a long and abiding relationship — strategic relationship — with Israel, and that will continue to be the case no matter who is leading the country,” reported the Washington Post. A plurality of Democratic voters, though, want that relationship to shift: The poll found 45 percent want the US to decrease the $3.8 billion in military aid it sends to Israel.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The argument that Israel practices apartheid, explained",2023-10-20,Vox,['Li Zhou'],"Filed under:Some human rights groups have reached this conclusion based on how the crime is defined in international law. In recent years, human rights organizations and legal experts have increasingly described Israel’s policies toward Palestinians as apartheid, adding to a longstanding debate about whether this is an accurate way to categorize the country’s practices. Apartheid, a term originating from the South African government’s systematic oppression of Black residents, is a crime against humanity under international law. At its core, it refers to policies intended to elevate one racial group over another, with the goal of maintaining the dominant group’s hegemony. In 1998, the International Criminal Court (to which Israel is not a party) defined it as “inhumane acts ... committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group ... and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.”Human rights groups have argued that the Israeli government’s policies on land access, restrictions on movement, and limitations on the right to vote meet the ICC’s standard and that it has institutionalized racism against Palestinians in order to ensure Israeli Jews remain the dominant group across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories (OPT), which includes the West Bank and Gaza. Israel and its allies, including the US and the European Commission, have rejected this assessment. International organizations’ use of this term has grown in the last five years. In 2021, Human Rights Watch (HRW) put out a report noting that the Israeli government engaged in “systematic oppression of Palestinians and inhumane acts,” which ultimately “amount to the crime of apartheid.” In 2022, Amnesty International reached a similar conclusion, saying that the Israeli state “imposes a system of oppression and domination against Palestinians” that “amounts to apartheid as prohibited in international law.” That same year, Michael Lynk, then the UN special rapporteur focused on human rights in occupied Palestinian territories, stated that the Israeli government used a “deeply discriminatory dual legal and political system,” which privileges Israeli Jewish settlers while disadvantaging Palestinian residents in these areas. (Lynk’s position was based on his review of Israeli government policies and does not reflect the position of the UN as an institution, which has a commission currently investigating this charge.)Some Israel scholars and former Israeli officials have also started using this designation. In 2022, Michael Ben-Yair, a former attorney general of Israel, said that “it is with great sadness  ... I must also conclude that my country has sunk to such political and moral depths that it is now an apartheid regime.” Earlier this year, Tamir Pardo, a former head of Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, emphasized, too, that “there is an apartheid state here” featuring “two people [who] are judged under two legal systems.” In protests and critiques of the Israeli government’s military actions this month, political leaders and activists around the world have often referenced the term while condemning the country’s policies. The Israeli government, meanwhile, has argued that any claims that it practices apartheid are “preposterous and false,” antisemitic, and dedicated to singling out the country. (Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have also condemned and examined apartheid elsewhere, including in Myanmar, where the Rohingya minority group has faced a great deal of violence.) Israel isn’t alone in its criticism of the term, which has been the source of international debate. Those who oppose its use, including the pro-Israel civil rights group Anti-Defamation League, argue that some of Israel’s restrictive policies toward Palestinians in the occupied territories are driven by security concerns and that they don’t view these policies as motivated by racism. Some critics also claim that the term apartheid cannot be used because only Palestinian noncitizens outside of Israel’s internationally recognized borders suffer from confinement and other potentially “inhumane acts,” while Palestinian citizens of Israel purportedly have the same rights as all other Israeli citizens, such as the ability to vote and run for office. The US and other Western allies of Israel have pushed back on this label as well. In 2023, the US House passed a resolution stating that Israel is not a “racist or apartheid state,” and in recent years, the Biden administration has said it disagreed with human rights analyses that argue that Israel practices apartheid. In January 2023, the European Commission also said that it is “not appropriate” to associate the term apartheid with the Israeli state.Human rights experts have countered these claims, noting that Israel’s policies in both Israel and the occupied territories are discriminatory against non-Jewish residents and that actions in the West Bank and Gaza far surpass any response possibly justified by security concerns. To better understand human rights groups arguments’ regarding the term apartheid, as well as the debate around it, Vox spoke with eight human rights, policy, and legal experts, including some who supported the designation and others who did not. This reporting focused on human rights organizations because those groups have been the key drivers of conversations about Israel’s policies, and in recent years have drawn new conclusions about what they constitute. “It’s an accurate legal designation of a situation of institutionalized discrimination and racial superiority. It is a harsh term, but this is a harsh situation,” Lynk, the former UN special rapporteur, told Vox. The term apartheid, which translates to “apartness” in Afrikaans, is most closely associated with policies and a legal system that segregated white and Black South Africans. In apartheid South Africa, laws deprived Black people of access to land, the right to vote, and the ability to move freely across the country. In the last 50 years, international bodies have put forth multiple definitions of apartheid, including the UN’s 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, which was established with South Africa in mind, and the ICC’s 1998 definition, which is broader and more commonly known as the Rome Statute.  Some of the human rights analyses, like Lynk’s, have specifically focused on the Israeli government’s policies in the occupied Palestinian territories. Others, however, like Amnesty International’s, apply the term to policies in both the occupied territories and within Israel’s borders. Broadly, they argue that apartheid is upheld in the OPT by the fact that Palestinians have limited ability to move freely, have no right to vote in Israeli elections, and are tried under a completely different legal system. Many experts also point to the passage of an Israeli law in 2018 establishing Israel as the “nation state of the Jewish people,” which was seen as effectively deeming non-Jewish residents second-class citizens.There’s a broader consensus among human rights experts that the Israeli government’s actions in the occupied territories constitute apartheid, though there isn’t as widespread consensus as to whether apartheid exists within Israel’s borders.In the past five years, human rights experts — building on decades of research into Israel’s policies by Palestinian and Israeli groups including Al-Haq and B’Tselem — have relied on the two international legal definitions when weighing whether to designate Israel as a country that practices apartheid. To conduct their review, human rights groups and experts have used a three-part test, based on both the 1973 Convention and the Rome Statute. Their reports state that apartheid exists if: Ultimately, Lynk at the UN — who examined the occupied territories — and HRW and Amnesty International, which looked at both the occupied territories and Israel, found that the Israeli government met all three criteria. Below were some of their findings, based on an examination of dozens of policies in the region:  1. Established an institutionalized regime of systematic racial oppression and discriminationIn the occupied territories, Israeli settlers have a completely different set of legal rights than Palestinians, says Lynk. While Israeli settlers in the territories can vote in Israeli elections, Palestinians cannot. Israeli settlers are also able to travel freely across the occupied territories and into Israel, while Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank cannot: They must apply for permits, which are difficult to obtain. Most Palestinians in Gaza are unable to leave the area at all, and those in the West Bank face onerous military checkpoints to travel through and out of the area. Furthermore, Israeli settlers are tried in Israeli civilian courts if accused of a crime, while Palestinians are tried in Israeli military court — which has an extremely high conviction rate and limited due process rights. And while Israeli settlers have the freedom of political speech and protest, Palestinians are governed by military orders that restrict these rights. This binary also exists when it comes to land access and confiscation in the occupied territories, where Palestinians have seen their land seized and used for Israeli settlements and infrastructure. Additionally, Palestinian enclaves in the West Bank are walled off and isolated from one another, and certain roads are segregated for Palestinian and Israeli traffic.   Omer Bartov, an Israeli-born Holocaust historian at Brown University, said of the policies in the West Bank: “Anyone who observes the reality on the ground can have no doubt about the nature of this regime, whereby 3 million Palestinians live under one set of laws and half a million Jewish settlers live under another set of laws.”“The rights they have are entirely determined on their nationality and their ethnicity ... and then we have, of course, the situation in Gaza, where they’re entirely fenced off from the rest of the world through an elaborate blockade since 2007,” says Lynk. Palestinian citizens of Israel have a wider set of rights than Palestinians in the occupied territories. They have the ability to vote in Israeli elections and serve in the Knesset, but they face limited opportunities to own land and build homes, along with evictions, differences in immigration policy, and implicit restrictions on social service access. Palestinian citizens face major challenges to get residential home permits approved due to zoning restrictions that limit expansion, and often risk demolition by building without them. Additionally, they’ve been the subject of evictions that human rights groups say are aimed at clearing the way for more Jewish-majority neighborhoods. The 1950 Law of Return also enables any Jewish person to move to Israel and become a citizen, while Palestinians do not have this right even if their families were previously displaced from land now within Israel’s borders. Furthermore, Israel ties some social benefits — including financial aid for education and discounted building permits — to military service. While Jewish Israelis must serve in the military (barring exceptions for certain religious groups, like ultra-Orthodox Jewish Israelis who may apply for exemptions), Palestinian Israelis aren’t required to do so, and many don’t. Because of that, most Palestinian citizens are left with reduced access to important benefits; ultra-Orthodox Jews who are exempted from military service also have to navigate this policy, but they have access to education subsidies that Palestinian citizens are not eligible for, per HRW. Overall, Palestinian Israelis have a more precarious political status than their Jewish counterparts because, as Amnesty International notes, Palestinian and Jewish citizens have different legal statuses: “Whilst they are granted citizenship, Palestinian citizens of Israel are denied a nationality, establishing a legal differentiation from Jewish Israelis.” This distinction matters because policies related to issues such as immigration are tied to nationality rather than citizenship. “When it comes to poverty, housing, getting permits to build houses, to equal rights when it comes to school education, everything, we are being treated as worse than second-class citizens,” Tamar Nafar, a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship, previously told ABC News. 2. Establishing the intent to maintain the domination of one racial group over anotherThose arguing that Israel practices apartheid point to the passage of a 2018 law known as the “nation-state law” as well as multiple statements that Israeli leaders have made emphasizing that they seek to prioritize the rights of Israeli Jewish residents in the region over those of other groups. That law — which was widely criticized by Palestinians and liberal Israeli Jews as undemocratic — explicitly stated that the right to “national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” That line underscored the reality that there was no political appetite for a one-state solution in which Palestinians and Israelis were treated equally, and its critics argued it made plain that Palestinians are second-class citizens. Additionally, the law said that “the state views Jewish settlement as a national value and will labor to encourage and promote its establishment and development,” while downgrading Arabic from its designation as an official language. These tenets were also interpreted as legally treating Palestinian citizens different from their Jewish counterparts.  Coupled with statements by Israeli government officials, groups say the intention to maintain the dominance of one group over others is evident. Israel is “the national state, not of all its citizens, but only of the Jewish people,” Israel’s current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2019. Outside of Israel’s borders, the Israeli government has supported what UN leaders describe as illegal settlements in the occupied territories, which have pushed Palestinians out of their communitie. According to a 2023 UN report, 700,000 Israeli settlers are living illegally in 279 settlements in the West Bank. Their influx has been linked to violence against Palestinians who live in the area and has led to the displacement of more than 1,100 Palestinians in the region in 2023 alone. “Israeli political leaders, past and present, have repeatedly stated that they intend to retain control over all of the occupied territory in order to enlarge the blocs of land for present and future Jewish settlement while confining the Palestinians to barricaded population reserves,” Lynk writes in the UN report. 	3. A series of inhumane acts that were committed as an integral part of this regime The UN has a list of what constitutes an inhuman act, which ranges from “denial to a member or members of a racial group or groups of the right to life and liberty” to “persecution of organizations and persons ... because they oppose apartheid.”Many items on the list apply to Israel, the reports argue. Among other things, they point to the blockade of Gaza as an example of what the UN calls measures “designed to divide the population along racial lines by the creation of separate reserves and ghettos for the members of a racial group or groups.” They also note that ”the disproportionate killings and woundings of civilians by the Israeli military” is a case of the UN’s “infliction upon the members of a racial group or groups of serious bodily or mental harm,” and the limitations Palestinians face in freedom of expression and protest as an example of Israel’s “persecution of organizations and persons, by depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms.”Throughout the reports, Israel stands accused of repeatedly engaging in nearly every inhuman act the UN convention describes.“The most stark thing I could say to try to illustrate this is that the poorest Israeli Jewish settlement in the West Bank enjoys more political, more economic, and more legal rights than the best and most well-off of Palestinian communities living right beside them,” says Lynk. “And that is probably the starkest and most visible example of how this huge differentiation of rights favors Israeli Jews and disadvantages Palestinian Arabs.”Lynk’s UN report, and other recent decisions to label Israel an apartheid practitioner, follow  decades of advocacy by Palestinian groups for the adoption of the term. More recently, Israeli human rights organizations including B’tselem have begun describing Israel as such. This past August, leading historians and Israel scholars, including Bartov, penned a letter criticizing the “regime of apartheid” by the Israeli government in the occupied territories. A large part of what’s fueling the current shift in rhetoric is the belief that the Israeli government’s occupation of Palestinian territories is a long-term arrangement. “I think the realization that a one-state reality is effectively here to stay and that there is no horizon for peace based on partition made people realize that [the] one-state reality is apartheid,” says Arab Center fellow Yousef Munayyer. Groups note, too, that by clearly demarcating these policies as apartheid and a crime against humanity, they can more accurately describe the reality of what’s taking place on the ground and urge international leaders to take sufficient action such as conditioning aid to Israel on changing its Palestine policy. Organizations have been careful to note that they have made this conclusion using the international legal framework and are not drawing a direct comparison with the apartheid system in South Africa, which included unique policies that aren’t all present in the Israel-Palestine context, such as “petty apartheid,” referring to laws that, for example, segregated benches and water fountains. South African leaders have been outspoken, though, in the similarities between the two systems, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who noted, for instance, that Israel had created an “apartheid reality” and that “parallels to my own beloved South Africa are painfully stark indeed.”Although more and more human rights groups are now describing Israel’s policies as apartheid, there’s also been pushback from some international law experts and groups like ADL. The Biden administration, the US House of Representatives, and the European Commission have also disagreed with the use of this term. Some of these groups point to the ICC definition to bolster their claims. Rather than focusing on “inhumane acts,” these groups stress the part of the definition that states a central feature of apartheid is “systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group.” These groups argue that racism, and race itself, is not at the center of the Israeli government’s policies — security is — and therefore apartheid cannot exist. Additionally, they suggest that the rights Palestinian citizens have in Israel negate the idea that such policies are driven by a discriminatory rationale. The term apartheid “often doesn’t leave space to consider the need for security considerations in policy design and implementation,” Yuval Shany, chair in public international law at Hebrew University, told Vox, arguing that travel restrictions between Israel and the West Bank criticized by many human rights groups were established due to concerns about suicide bombers. Generally, human rights experts take issue with the idea that many of the policies Israel has imposed in the West Bank and elsewhere have a security justification. “[M]any abuses, including categorical denials of building permits, mass residency revocations or restrictions, and large-scale land confiscations, have no legitimate security justifications,” Human Rights Watch states. Additionally, they note, the need for national security can be leveraged to legitimize human rights abuses. Others who take issue with the term apartheid note that Palestinian citizens of Israel have key rights, including the ability to serve in the Knesset, and use that fact to argue institutionalized racism doesn’t drive the country’s policies. “Israel does not have a racial segregation implemented by law,” Haaretz opinion editor Anat Kaam wrote in the Daily Beast in October 2022. “There are Arab citizens—citizens with full, equal rights—in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, as well as in the Israeli court system, including the Supreme Court. There are Arab doctors, professors, policemen, teachers, and countless other professions, working side by side with Jews.” This argument was expanded upon at length by the American Center for Law and Justice’s Jay Sekulow, a Trump attorney, and Robert Ash, in a 2023 paper. They argue that the fact that Arab citizens of Israel have an opportunity of success in Israel — structural factors complicating that reality aside — undercuts the claim that the government uses race in its policies. Instead, they too claim that Israel’s policies in the occupied territories are driven by the ongoing conflict between Palestinians in these areas with the Israeli government. Such assessments, however, fail to acknowledge the ways that Israel discriminates against Palestinian citizens inside its borders, human rights groups say. Again, Palestinians in Israel face restrictions on the land they can buy and barriers to certain social services as well as family reunification. Inside Israel, despite Palestinians comprising around 20 percent of the population, Palestinian municipalities make up just 3 percent of its land, Human Rights Watch says. And while Palestinian citizens of Israel may have more rights than Palestinians in the occupied territories, experts emphasize that the disparities they experience are undergirded by the same institutionalized racism at their core. “If there are 7 million Israeli Jews and 7 million Palestinian Arabs under the rule of Israel, and Israel is meant to be a Jewish state, then there is no other explanation than race and ethnicity to explain the treatment of the 5.2 million Palestinians under occupation without rights and the 1.8 million Palestinian citizens of Israel with second-class rights,” says Lynk. “None of this is acceptable under any modern understanding of democracy.” The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The high-stakes debate over how the US defines ""antisemitism""",2023-05-25,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:The White House’s new strategy for fighting antisemitism has global implications.Swastikas painted on walls. A hostage crisis at a synagogue in Texas. The rapper Ye tweeting, “I’m going death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE.” “The rise in antisemitism is astonishing, never before seen in this country,” Liz Sherwood-Randall, the White House’s homeland security adviser, told the Council on Foreign Relations on Wednesday. “We’re not only seeing the kind of antisemitism that led to my mother being chased home from school in Omaha when she was a little girl. But that there’s actually increasing violence against our Jewish communities, threats of violence, acts of violence in synagogues.”The number of incidents has risen to a new high. Because of that, President Joe Biden launched the White House’s first national strategy to address antisemitism, which was released this morning. “In the past several years, hate has been given too much oxygen, fueling a record rise in antisemitism,” Biden said Thursday while announcing the report. “It’s on all of us to stop it.” But that report, with 100 actions federal agencies will take within the next year to counter antisemitism, was first held up by the question of how to define “antisemitism.”

  The State Department and other federal agencies use a definition promoted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). The first part of the IHRA working definition is pretty straightforward: “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”  But then it goes on to chart out 11 examples of its use in practice, seven of which relate to Israel. Governments’ and nonprofits’ embrace of that definition can effectively set the bounds of criticizing Israel, whether those are criticism of Israel’s policies or comments expressing opposition to Zionism, the ideology underpinning the establishment of the State of Israel. Ye expressing vitriol against the Jewish people is a clear-cut case. But when academics in Europe who are involved in Palestine activism have expressed criticism of the State of Israel or of Zionism, the IHRA definition has been deployed to label them as antisemitic. A 2019 lawsuit against the University of Massachusetts Amherst cited IHRA in an attempt to cancel a pro-Palestine event. The White House strategy did not exclusively endorse or embrace the IHRA definition — even after intensive lobbying from establishment Jewish American organizations, like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the American Jewish Committee. That may be because the definition has been politicized, with a robust and far-from-settled debate among the American Jewish community about its shortcomings. There are also other definitions, like the Nexus document, which the White House report mentions alongside the IHRA one. Major progressive Jewish American organizations see this as a victory because the IHRA definition, however widely adopted, has been used to limit speech around Israel and Palestine. It conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel and with anti-Zionism. “This definition is being used as a tool to suppress dissent against Israeli government policy,” says Yousef Munayyer, a researcher at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank. “It’s largely been seen as this sort of inter-Jewish American debate over the technicalities. But in reality, this is an issue with international dimensions.”The White House’s acknowledgment of several definitions of antisemitism, as technical as that might sound, holds significance — especially as Israel’s extreme-right government pushed the US to adopt the IHRA definition.

  It goes to a bigger question about how much of the antisemitism conversation should be about Israel, and to what extent the discourse should be policed. Antisemitism in America is rising, but hate crimes are notoriously difficult to track. The exact numbers are not established in part because data depends on reporting from law enforcement that offers “incomplete and inaccurate” information, as Mari Cohen has reported in Jewish Currents. Defining antisemitism introduces another complication into the tracking.The most prominent nonprofit to monitor civil rights issues as they relate to Jews in America is the Anti-Defamation League, and their data is similarly enmeshed in this controversy. “ADL has frequently included incidents of anti-Zionist political expression in its antisemitism tally,” writes Cohen. (The ADL notes that “forms of anti-Israel political protest and expressions of opposition to Israeli policies are not included in the Audit,” but, “It is antisemitic to direct anti-Israel messaging at Jewish institutions or schools.”)The contours have long presented a problem, and it’s part of the origin story of the IHRA definition.In the early 2000s, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and others developed a working definition of antisemitism that was later adapted by the political organization associated with the European Union called the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. It also sought to navigate through the complicated questions that might follow from those broad principles. That’s where the definition gets controversial. Groups that take more progressive stances on Israel, like J Street, Americans for Peace Now, and the New Israel Fund, have come out against the definition. The National Council of Jewish Women calls the definition a good “education tool” but cautions, “We do not recommend this be codified into law or used to prohibit freedom of speech in any way.” Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, American civil liberties organizations, and the American Bar Association have also rejected it.

  The 11 examples of antisemitism cited by the IHRA definition include “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.” But for many critics of the State of Israel, the establishment of a state with a religious character that excludes certain citizens from self-determination is indeed racist. Palestinians living under Israeli occupation lack the rights and freedoms associated with Israeli citizenship, and have no path to get it. But calling out the Israeli state’s policies as racist could be construed as antisemitic under this definition.Another example cited by IHRA is “Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.” The celebrated Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea recently compared the Israeli settler rampage on a Palestinian village to Kristallnacht, the night in 1938 when Germans destroyed Jewish shops and homes in a coordinated wave of deadly hate. Is that antisemitic? Then there is the saying that it’s antisemitic to hold “Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.” If a group protests Israeli policies in front of a synagogue, is that considered antisemitic? To be sure, Israel is sometimes used as a blunt instrument to express bigoted perspectives about Jews. But IHRA doesn’t have clear answers to any of these concerns, which is why several experts, organizers, and practitioners I interviewed described the IHRA definition as a tool, but one that exists among many definitions that are helpful in describing complex political and social events.Still, the IHRA definition has gained currency in the US and worldwide. The State Department adopted it in 2010, the European Parliament in 2021, and six countries have formally implemented it. Representatives of the Israeli government have been forthright that the intentions of codifying the definition have broader implications. “We work with the Foreign Ministry to bring nations around the world to adopt the wider definition of antisemitism outlined by IHRA,” says Israel’s minister of diaspora affairs Amichai Chikli in an interview with Ynetnews. “The IHRA definition is currently one of the most essential and strategic tools for the fight against antisemitism, with an emphasis on ‘new antisemitism’ that strives to deny the legitimacy of the State of Israel to exist.”Yousef Munayyer notes that the Israeli government’s and US Jewish community’s emphasis on the IHRA definition is a recent shift. For the last few years, the Israeli government worked with advocacy groups to push forward anti-boycott laws in states across the US to protect the State of Israel from economic protests. Now that those efforts have clashed with the First Amendment in court and led to grassroots advocacy against it, they have shifted more energy to IHRA as a tool. “It is a major policy priority of the Israeli government to get the United States and other governments to adopt this definition,” Munayyer explained.Establishment Jewish groups like the ADL, the American Jewish Committee, and the World Jewish Congress have made adopting the IHRA definition a pillar of their policy. “The entire IHRA definition is broad enough to address and engage on modern antisemitism, as we find it, and that is what’s needed in order to more effectively combat this evil,” Max Sevillia, an ADL vice president, told me. “I don’t think it overemphasizes anti-Israel anything. It’s one of the many examples of how antisemitism is manifested.”But Hadar Susskind, president of Americans for Peace Now, a progressive nonprofit linked to Israel’s peace movement, told me, “The IHRA definition is about policing discourse about Israel. Period.” In the last few months, Israeli Knesset members of the right-wing parties started calling human rights groups antisemitic under IHRA. Countering antisemitism is an issue that’s so important to President Joe Biden that he got fired up about it at the White House’s first-ever Jewish American Heritage Month reception on May 16. He reminded the audience that he ran for the presidency in response to the white supremacist march in Charlottesville in 2017.“I will not remain silent, nor will any of you,” he said alongside first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff. Now, the White House has taken a strategic position in the IHRA debate by deciding not to adopt it exclusively but mentioning it alongside other definitions.This was not a given. The State Department’s special envoy for countering antisemitism, the scholar Deborah Lipstadt, endorses the definition. Her boss, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, has “enthusiastically” backed IHRA, and the State Department has encouraged other governments to sign off on it. Five sources familiar with the task force’s deliberations said this inter-community debate has held up the release of the report.What’s important is that Biden’s White House appears to understand that antisemitism is connected to other forms of hatred. In December, Biden launched the new task force to “better coordinate U.S. Government efforts to counter antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination within the United States.”The White House has engaged a diversity of stakeholders on this — a thousand different stakeholders played a role, as Biden said recently. Activists told me about listening sessions with progressive Jewish groups, academics, students, and Muslim groups. It hasn’t just relied on the establishment Jewish American organizations, who have long held a monopoly on this discourse and rhetoric.But the White House strategy seems to acknowledge that the IHRA definition has been politicized. “As we confront antisemitism, we do so with profound respect for our democratic traditions, including free expression and speech protected by the First Amendment,” it reads.In navigating pressure from establishment groups and progressive organizations, Biden’s team took a more inclusive approach. “The White House knew that they would anger the majority of American Jews who are progressive, and other communities, namely Muslim and Arab, who would be directly targeted by the administration adopting a speech code like this,” says Simone Zimmerman, the communications director of the Diaspora Alliance. This view meshes with Kenneth Stern, an author of the IHRA definition, who wrote in the Guardian that it shouldn’t be enshrined into law or used to regulate speech. “The reason why I think it’s so contentious is that there’s a debate inside the Jewish community of what it means to our identity in terms of our relationship with Israel,” Stern said on a podcast in 2021. “I don’t know how that gets settled, but we’re fighting this out as a proxy battle about demanding that people have Israel as part of their identity.” By not prioritizing any one definition in this debate, the White House is instead putting the focus on the pillars of the strategy: increasing awareness, improving security of Jewish communities, pushing back against antisemitism, and building new coalitions against hate. “It matters. It’s the most ambitious, comprehensive effort in our history to combat antisemitism in America,” Biden said earlier this month.A recent Elon Musk tweet highlighted one of the key issues the task force should confront: right-wing antisemitism.On May 15, the Twitter owner posted that “Soros reminds me of Magneto.” George Soros — who is Jewish and a billionaire financier known for backing progressive organizations and political campaigns — has long been a boogeyman of far-right conspiracy theorists. Musk compared him to the X-Man supervillain Magneto, who is Jewish, and Musk followed up by saying, “Soros hates humanity.” It was perhaps the world’s loudest dog whistle. Antisemitism is a unique form of hatred, but it’s also connected to the spike in white nationalist views in this country. Former President Donald Trump has dined with a prominent white supremacist and has long used antisemitic stereotypes. “I think that the amount of hate he unleashed,” says former State Department envoy for countering antisemitism Hannah Rosenthal, “set the tone for this country.”When Rosenthal was Obama’s envoy to combat antisemitism in the State Department, she would hold trainings for foreign service officers on what antisemitism is. She recalled being asked: If someone says the Palestinians have a right to a country, is that antisemitic? If people are having a protest about Israeli policy in front of a synagogue, is that antisemitism? “I’d say, I’m not gonna give you glib answers. Let’s talk about that. Sometimes, it’s nuanced. Sometimes, it’s very clear,” she told me. “What happened in Pittsburgh was antisemitic.”  In 2018, a gunman killed 11 people worshiping at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where three congregations were praying. When Trump came to visit after the fact, the synagogue’s Rabbi Jeffrey Myers offered strong words. “I said to him, ‘Mr. President, hate speech leads to hateful actions. Hate speech leads to what happened in my sanctuary, where seven of my congregants were slaughtered. I witnessed it with my eyes,’” he later told CNN. Many experts see the uptick in antisemitic attacks as largely stemming from the normalization of bigotry, which Trump and his supporters have enabled. Yet right-wing influential voices have downplayed this dynamic. The author Bari Weiss, for example, in her 2019 book How to Fight Anti-Semitism, underplayed Trump’s bigoted rants. She devoted much of the book, however, to what she views as left-wing antisemitism, which is often just criticism of Israel.  Some advocates and organizers told me that the retrenched antisemitism is rooted in white nationalism. So it doesn’t make sense to cordon off this form of bigotry from others. In this sense, it’s noteworthy that this was all launched as a task force on “related forms of bias and discrimination,” but started with a process on antisemitism. From Rosenthal’s perspective, coalition-building is important, but this also requires a stand-alone effort. “Unless someone is tasked with looking at antisemitism, it won’t be looked at,” she told me.Clarification, May 26, 1 pm ET: Updated to clarify that the Pittsburgh gunman killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue, including four people from other congregations who were worshiping in the building.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."

"The Israel-Hamas hostage deal, explained",2023-11-21,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Here’s what the reported hostage deal does — and doesn’t — mean for war in Gaza. Late Tuesday, the Israeli government and Hamas reached a deal that will bring the first pause in hostilities in over six weeks — and bring at least some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners home. Qatar, which brokered the deal over the last month, confirmed it on Tuesday night, after its rough outline had been reported throughout the day. Now, Hamas and Israel are working out the final details. Hamas would exchange 50 hostages — women and children who are Israeli and dual-national — with Israel for about 150 Palestinian prisoners currently held in custody, mostly women. The swap will happen in four phases, and the corridor and exact procedure are still being negotiated, including the lists of those who would be exchanged. If all goes to plan, Israel would commence a four-day ceasefire in Gaza and would also stop drone overflights for six hours a day. After those days, the ceasefire could be extended a day with each additional 10 hostages Hamas releases. During this period, Israel would not allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, but would allow some 300 trucks of aid in daily, including fuel.This is a deal that has essentially been on the table for about a month, and according to the Guardian, negotiations were already happening before Israel launched its ground attacks on Gaza. Israel had defined its twin objectives as eliminating Hamas and bringing the hostages back, but experts noted that the former had been the priority until political dynamics led to an increased willingness among Israeli leadership to accept a truce to bring some hostages home. “Public pressure led Netanyahu to agree to a deal that he refused until now,” journalist Yossi Verter wrote in Haaretz’s Hebrew edition.The deal itself would be neither a resolution to the war nor to the roots of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It’s a significant development that’s better than nothing, but it’s not a long-term solution. In a statement, President Joe Biden thanked Qatari, Egyptian, and Israeli leaders and described the deal — “a testament to the tireless diplomacy and determination” — as a hostage release. The focus, as the White House put it, is bringing home more American hostages, rather than a bigger truce. When Hamas conducted its October 7 attack and took about 240 Israeli, dual-national, and international people hostage, Israel’s security outlook changed. Its drive to pursue a destructive military campaign in Gaza is based in a desire to “destroy Hamas.” But, as US and Arab officials acknowledged at an international summit over the weekend, there is no plan for Gaza the day after, or even now. Israel’s lack of strategy or goals in its response to the Hamas attack has led to a situation where Israel’s ongoing military operations risk becoming a forever war just like America’s over the last two decades.At the same time, Palestinians in Gaza are suffering most. Al Jazeera has reported that there are no functioning hospitals in the northern part of the occupied territory, in large part due to Israeli military incursions and a lack of fuel, and that the remaining 21 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals are “completely out of service.” In the lead-up to the announcement of a ceasefire, Israel’s attacks on Gaza continued. The deal is a diplomatic achievement, to be sure, but it’s only the beginning of a set of complex negotiations that will be needed to address the ongoing war, the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians in Gaza, and the potential for the war to extend to the broader Middle East. For weeks, Qatar, with US buy-in, has been helping facilitate negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a deal somewhat along the lines of today’s. But the experts I’ve spoken to in recent weeks had reservations. The skepticism was not around the need for the talks or their import, but more about their fragility; these deals are only real once they’re announced, and even then they are tenuous. (At least once over the last week, media reports indicated a deal was imminent, only for those assertions to be walked back.)But on Tuesday evening, Netanyahu endorsed the deal and pushed his government’s ministers to accept it during a meeting that lasted over five hours before they finally voted to approve the deal. “Tonight we stand before a difficult decision, but it is the right decision. All security organizations support it fully,” he told Israeli television. In recent days, the White House has maintained that the deal was “close” but President Joe Biden wouldn’t go into further detail.A combination of Qatar’s orchestration of the deal, Israeli internal political pressure on Netanyahu, and Hamas’s commitment to getting the release of Palestinian prisoners has contributed to this truce and exchange.Some secrecy is required for such a deal to work, but that can also work to its detriment. Analysts speculate, for example, that Hamas would treat the exchange of Israeli civilians differently than it would Israeli soldiers. In the past, Israel has been willing to exchange many Palestinians for its soldiers: Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, was released from an Israeli prison as part of the 2011 deal for an Israeli soldier that released 1,000 Palestinians, for example. “We will not forget our prisoners who we left behind,” Sinwar said upon his release. The terms are not likely to be made public in full, and there aren’t really any enforcement mechanisms. “It’s hard to tell when an agreement was violated, who violated it, and then how we can kind of get back to some sort of ceasefire agreement,” Yousef Munayyer, a researcher at the Arab Center in Washington, DC, told me. “This is something that’s played out between Israel and Hamas a lot, going back to 2008. So one of my concerns is like, what are the exact terms of this agreement? And are both sides publicly committing to the same terms?”Israelis will have 24 hours to appeal any deal to the Supreme Court, and the Almagor Terror Victims Association has said it will. This is one of several potential hiccups as Israel and Hamas work to implement the deal over the coming days; Israeli attacks on Gaza continued Wednesday before the likely cessation of hostilities at 10 am Thursday local time.One reason Israel has agreed to the deal now is the growing advocacy from the families of hostages. “The government is in complete disarray,” Mairav Zonszein, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told me. “In the first few weeks of this, the hostages were like an afterthought, they were not the priority. That’s a huge shift that happened in the last few weeks, where the families after the initial shock started to organize themselves and they basically put it on the agenda.”As the families became more organized and more agitated, they became more convinced that the Israeli government was avoiding doing the deal. Their slogan became “Deal Now!” These demands didn’t just exert pressure on Netanyahu’s government, but on him individually — calling into question his longtime framing of himself as Mr. Security, at a moment when he’s extremely politically vulnerable. Israel has perhaps also made a strategic calculation that its military campaign of 46 days had shown it was serious about its objective of eliminating Hamas. However impossible experts say that it might be to decimate a militant group that’s part of a broader social and political organization, Israel didn’t want to look as though they were compromising from a position of weakness. “For the Israelis, politically, I don’t think they were going to be prepared to accept any sort of exchange on October 8,” Munayyer explained. “They first wanted to do some damage. They first wanted to make it feel like they were imposing a price on Hamas before they made any sort of agreement, even though it was likely that an agreement was inevitable at some point.”Though Israel still sees negotiations as a defeat or a concession, it’s really the only path to future peace and security for the region.Whatever the shape of the deal, the question looms of what happens next to Gaza. In the short term, more suffering seems clear. Netanyahu has pledged to continue military operations in Gaza after the five-day pause. “The war has its stages, and the release of the hostages has its stages as well. But we won’t rest until we achieve total victory, and until we bring everyone back,” he said in the televised remarks.There also is no ceasefire or pause negotiated on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah and Israel have been trading strikes.And longer-term, what came out of last week’s summit of Middle East leaders in Manama, Bahrain, is that there is no plan, no commitment, no interest. “After two days of talking to officials about the plan for post-war Gaza, the inescapable conclusion is that there is no plan. The shattered enclave will need external help to provide security, reconstruction and basic services,” the Economist reported. “But no one—not Israel, not America, not Arab states or Palestinian leaders—wants to take responsibility for it.”And it’s easy for Biden’s people to talk about a two-state solution, as we’ve seen in their talking points in recent days. The Israeli military operation will only go so far in achieving its goals. There will need to be a bigger political agreement to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Its core concerns won’t be solved militarily, as the hostage exchange deal makes clear. “You need a political path,” Ezzedine Choukri Fishere, a former Egyptian diplomat now at Dartmouth College, told me recently. “If this is only talk as it has been over the last few decades, then the outcome will be the same”: a frozen peace process that has gone nowhere.Like this exchange, such an over-the-horizon conversation about what happens to Gaza and the future of Palestinians is going to require engaging indirectly with Hamas. “The stated goal of destroying Hamas is not achievable,” Khaled Elgindy, a researcher with the Middle East Institute, told me last month. “So how do you even know when you’ve gotten to the day after?” That’s not exactly popular to hear. One thing to watch is whether more Western countries and organizations call for a ceasefire. Though the French president, the United Nations, and leading humanitarian groups have urged one, other countries have rejected these calls. This pause may lead others to join the group. And that may ultimately put pressure on the Biden administration and other leaders. “The idea is that you need to stop the killing in order to figure out how you can build on that, how you can try to figure out alternatives to the fighting,” Zonszein told me.Right now, Gaza needs aid. The 300 trucks that US humanitarian envoy David Satterfield briefed journalists about this week won’t be enough, and Israel has restricted movement within Gaza. The UN notes that there still isn’t electricity in Gaza, hospitals face severe shortages, and Israel has not allowed food shipments to enter northern Gaza. According to the latest data from the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 14,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, over half of whom are women and children, and 1.7 million people have been internally displaced. The situation in Gaza is beyond dire, with 53 journalists reportedly killed in Israeli strikes and more than 100 United Nations officials killed. The World Health Organization described al-Shifa Hospital as a “death zone.”At the same time, militant groups with links to Iran are attacking US military installations in Iraq, Syria, and off the coast of Yemen. The risks of this war expanding and drawing the US into a more direct role endure.

Why Palestinians protest every May 15,2023-05-15,Vox,['Ranjani Chakraborty'],"Filed under:The Palestinian catastrophe, explained.Around the time that Israelis celebrate Independence Day, Palestinians commemorate the Nakba, or “the Catastrophe.” The Nakba was a series of events, centered around 1948, that expelled hundreds of thousands Palestinians from their homeland and killed thousands. The Nakba isn’t the beginning of the story, but it’s a key part of Palestinian history — and the root of Israel’s creation. Prior to the Nakba, Palestine had a thriving population — largely made up of Arabs — who had lived and worked the land for centuries. But with the founding of Zionism, years of British meddling, and a British pledge to help create a Jewish state in Palestine, things began to change drastically. By 1947, with increasing tensions between Jewish settlers and Palestinian Arabs, the British left Palestine, and the UN stepped in with a plan to partition the land into two states. What followed was known as Plan Dalet: operations by Israeli paramilitary groups that violently uprooted Palestinians. An estimated 15,000 Palestinians were killed, more than 500 villages were decimated, and roughly 750,000 Palestinians displaced. Most who were expelled from their homes couldn’t return to historic Palestine. And today, millions of their descendants live in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, and surrounding countries. The history of the Nakba has been deliberately concealed and often ignored in Western narratives around the creation of Israel. In this episode of Missing Chapter, we break down how the Nakba happened — and how it defined the future of Palestine.

Why are the US and Israel so friendly?,2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Why the US and Israel have had such a close relationship for so long.That’s a hugely controversial question. Though American support for Israel really is massive, including billions of dollars in aid and reliable diplomatic backing, experts disagree sharply on why. Some possibilities include deep support for Israel among the American public, the influence of the pro-Israel lobby, and American ideological affinity with the Middle East’s most stable democracy.The countries were not nearly so close in Israel’s first decades. President Eisenhower was particularly hostile to Israel during the 1956 Suez War, which Israel, the UK, and France fought against Egypt.As the Cold War dragged on, the US came to view Israel as a key buffer against Soviet influence in the Middle East and supported it accordingly. The American-Israeli alliance didn’t really cement until around 1973, when American aid helped save Israel from a surprise Arab invasion.Since the Cold War, the foundation of the still-strong (and arguably stronger) relationship between the countries has obviously shifted. Some suggest that a common interest in fighting jihadism ties America to Israel, while others point to American leaders’ ideological attachment to an embattled democracy. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that the American public has, for a long time, sympathized far more with Israel than with Palestine:One very controversial theory, advanced by Professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, credits the relationship to the power of the pro-Israel lobby, particularly the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Critics of this theory argue that AIPAC isn’t as strong as Walt and Mearsheimer think. AIPAC’s failure to torpedo the Iran nuclear deal during the Obama administration underscored the critics’ point.Regardless of the reasons for the “special relationship,” American support for Israel really is quite extensive. The US has given Israel $118 billion in aid over the years (about $3 billion per year nowadays). Half of all American UN Security Council vetoes blocked resolutions critical of Israel.Despite this fundamentally close relationship, there are occasionally tensions between Israeli and American officials. This was particularly true under US President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; the two leaders clashed regularly over issues like settlements and Iran. The relationship reached a particularly nasty point when Netanyahu planned, with congressional Republicans, a March 2015 speech to a joint session of Congress that was highly critical of Obama’s approach to Iran. The Obama administration was furious over what it saw as Netanyahu conspiring with Obama’s domestic political opposition to undermine his policies.The Trump administration has led to renewed warmth in the Israeli-American relationship, culminating in Trump’s December decision to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The stark difference between Obama and Trump approaches to Netanyahu reflects a growing partisan gap inside the United States, with Republicans taking an increasingly hard-line “pro-Israel” position. If Democrats end up concomitantly becoming more willing to criticize the Israeli government, Israel may well end up a partisan issue in America — which actually would threaten the foundations of the US-Israel alliance.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The overlooked message behind Republicans’ response to the Ohio train derailment,2023-02-23,Vox,['Ben Jacobs'],"Filed under:The response to the toxic Ohio spill by Trump and key Republicans is about more than just Joe Biden. Ideological realignments don’t happen overnight. Former President Donald Trump’s visit to East Palestine, Ohio, on Wednesday was not notable for its rhetoric or its optics. Instead, Trump’s visit to a community that features the type of Rust Belt diners where, since 2016, journalists by the dozen have been dispatched to do cultural anthropology served as another waypoint on the Republican Party’s ongoing shift to become a party centered on non-college-educated voters.The disaster in East Palestine has received national attention, particularly in conservative media, after a freight train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed just outside the east Ohio town located near the border with Pennsylvania. It wasn’t so much the derailment that captured national attention, but the controlled burn of vinyl chloride released from freight cars in the aftermath of the accident. The apocalyptic images of clouds of black smoke reaching into the sky provided compelling visuals to go along with the health concerns of residents and evidence of fish die-offs in local streams as chemicals spilled into the ground from the wreck.The derailment also sparked a furious reaction from the right, as it presents a potpourri of issues for Republicans to grapple with — corporate power, the growing skepticism toward public health authorities post-pandemic, and, of course, simple partisan critiques of a Democratic president. But it wasn’t just partisan critiques. As Jon Schweppe, the director of policy and government affairs at the American Principles Project, a conservative think tank, told Vox, “What’s nice about it from my perspective — it’s not uniquely, ‘This is all Biden’s fault.’ It’s not just politics. There’s an understanding that there are other forces at play that led to this happening.”  While Republicans can freely blame President Joe Biden and his administration for its response — with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg facing particular scrutiny — the East Palestine disaster also presents an opportunity for the GOP’s populist wing to further break from party orthodoxy and target corporate America. In this case, the easy target is Norfolk Southern, the railroad conglomerate that owned the derailed freight train. Saurabh Sharma, the president of American Moment, a public policy organization that aims to influence the next generation of professional conservatives to become more populist, said, “I think that this tragedy that happened in East Palestine is an opportunity for Republicans that have been looking for opportunities to distinguish themselves from the neoliberal set in the party to do so.”The question is whether they will take the opportunity. In his brief remarks Wednesday at the local fire station, Trump gestured broadly at the railroad industry. “Norfolk Southern needs to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations,” he said in rambling remarks that also criticized US funding for Ukraine and dwelled on when Ohio State University decided to resume its football season during the Covid pandemic in 2020. Trump is one of many Republicans who have criticized Biden for going to Kyiv this weekend to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in advance of a long-planned trip to Poland rather than visiting East Palestine. These range from other presidential hopefuls to Fox News commentators and even East Palestine’s mayor, Trent Conaway, who said Biden’s trip to Eastern Europe was “a slap in the face.”Ohio Republican Sen. J.D. Vance also appeared at the event. Vance has been active in the response to East Palestine in recent days, vocally criticizing both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its lack of guidance and Norfolk Southern for its failures to clean up chemicals in the area.Trump has also faced criticism from the Biden administration over the accident, which has tried to connect the derailment to a deregulatory effort around train braking systems undertaken by the Trump White House.  Liam Donovan, a lobbyist and longtime Republican operative, saw the East Palestine event as simply Trump seizing a PR opportunity rather than emblematic of a broader trend within the Republican Party. “We’re in a situation where the former president is one of three people in the race and he’s having trouble getting attention,” said Donovan. For Donovan, the significance of the visit was about “what’s in the news today and what’s on Tucker [Carlson] last night and going in search of it, more than the populism and anti-corporatism.”Yet it also did capture a certain bit of the conservative zeitgeist within what Schweppe called “elite populist circles.” As he put it, “There is a growing sense that all of these corporations are against us — not only are they trying to screw us over on the woke stuff, but generally, they just don’t care about ordinary people.”Sharma noted that this happened only months after some Republicans joined with progressives in December to oppose a Biden-backed effort to settle a railway strike that was opposed by some unions. The strike, Sharma said, presents an opportunity for the right to draw attention to “a case of corporate malfeasance that doesn’t have an easy culture war angle.”The question is whether the East Palestine accident drives Republicans to embrace those populist issues. As one Republican familiar with the response told Vox, there are “cross-cutting cleavages.” The Republican said while “corporate graft and greed” can be blamed, there are other easy villains, including “bureaucratic incompetence” and the indifference of “cultural elites,” that fit easily within existing conservative messaging.  Even Sharma didn’t see the GOP response to the accident as being part of a revolution, but of a long slow evolution in Republican thinking on these sorts of issues. For him, the measure of the impact of the conservative response would not be in “grand, sweeping policy proposals.” Instead, it would be whether the accident “now enters the lexicon of how a certain kind of Capitol Hill staffer or conservative public policy analyst thinks about a given legislative proposal.”He said the next time the railroad industry pushes Congress for further deregulation, this will be on the minds of the relevant GOP actors in a serious way. After all, Trump’s first White House may have taken deregulatory steps around freight railroads, but would his second do so as well?The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Trump’s Israel-Palestine peace plan, explained",2020-01-28,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:“The real threat to peace is if the plan succeeds,” an expert told Vox.President Donald Trump claims his peace plan for Israel and Palestine will prove to be a triumph that will last for the next 80 years. But it’s unclear whether it will be viable for even 80 minutes.That’s because most analysts believe the deal — the political portion of which was finally released on Tuesday — is dead on arrival.“It’s a total shitshow,” a former senior White House official familiar with the peace plan process told me the day before its release. In roughly 50 pages, the administration’s political strategy — masterminded by Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner — aims to solve the intractable problems that have stymied both Democratic and Republican administrations for decades. It defines the future of Israeli settlements, how Palestinians might conditionally form a state, and America’s view of Israel’s myriad security concerns. What it doesn’t do is provide a “right of return” for displaced Palestinians to their ancestral homes in Israel, allow for a sovereign state of Palestine to form a military that it could use to threaten Israel (or to defend itself against Israel), or give Palestinians any meaningful part of Jerusalem as its capital.In fact, it essentially ignores all of the Palestinians’ key desires, as the plan was drafted with no input from Palestinian leaders.The rollout’s optics, which featured Trump alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but with no Palestinian leadership present, won’t quell those concerns. Some even argue the plan’s release is more meant to help Netanyahu win a tough election in March. “The so-called ‘deal of the century’ isn’t a peace plan at all. It is a plan to reelect Benjamin Netanyahu,” Guy Ziv, an Israel expert at American University, told me. “If this plan was truly aimed at breaking the diplomatic stalemate, the Palestinians would have been consulted in the plan’s formulation.” He noted that their negotiators cut off ties when Trump’s team decided to move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. “It’s not a serious plan,” Ziv continued. “It satisfies neither the national aspirations of the Palestinian people nor Israel’s security needs.”But to hear Trump tell it, he has brokered the most important diplomatic breakthroughs not just of his presidency but of modern history. “It’s been a long and very arduous process to arrive at this moment,” Trump said in a speech at the White House Tuesday, standing next to a smiling Netanyahu. “All prior administrations from President Lyndon Johnson have tried and bitterly failed, but I was not elected to do small things or shy away from big problems.”Netanyahu, for his part, was thrilled with the outcome.“I believe that down the decades, and perhaps down the centuries, we will also remember January 28, 2020, because on this day, you became the first world leader to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over areas that are vital to our security and central to our heritage,” the prime minister said to Trump.What happens next is key. It’s unclear if America’s allies in the Middle East and Europe will stand behind the strategy, and Palestinian leaders have already rejected it. Netanyahu aims to push for a vote Sunday to annex 30 percent of the West Bank and parts of the Jordan Valley — clearly emboldened by the plan’s release.Which means it already looks like the Trump administration has deepened the crisis it promised to solve. “The real threat to peace is if the plan succeeds,” Khaled Elgindy, an adviser to Palestinian leadership from 2004 to 2009 and now at the Middle East Institute in Washington, told me.There’s a lot to this document, but there are four major elements of the new political proposal in particular you need to know about: 1) Israel keeps the vast majority of Jerusalem as its sovereign capital; 2) Palestinians get no right of return; 3) it redraws borders mainly between Israel and the West Bank; and 4) doesn’t allow for Palestine to create a fighting force to defend itself. First, Israel gets the entirety of an undivided Jerusalem as its capital. A future state of Palestine would get a few neighborhoods in far eastern Jerusalem. That’s a major decision. For the first 20 years of Israel’s existence, Jerusalem was divided. Israel controlled the parts of Jerusalem and its suburbs inside the red dotted line on this map, while Jordan controlled everything outside of it (blue dotted lines separate Jerusalem proper from suburbs):Jordan controlled the Temple Mount, a hill in the map’s brown splotch. The hill hosts the Western Wall, a retaining wall of an ancient Jewish temple and one of Judaism’s holiest sites, and two of Islam’s most important landmarks, the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Israeli Jews weren’t allowed to pray in the area while Jordan controlled it. During the 1967 war, Israel took control of East Jerusalem.Israel calls Jerusalem its undivided capital today, but few countries recognize it as such. UN Security Council Resolution 478 condemns Israel’s decision to annex East Jerusalem as a violation of international law and calls for a compromise solution.So for the Trump administration to basically say, “Sorry, all of Jerusalem belongs to Israel,” is a gutsy move that will make Israel’s leaders happy but doom any chance of bringing the Palestinians on board.The plan explicitly states that there shall be no “right to return” for the millions of Palestinians forced out of their ancestral homes during the formation of the Israeli state.The 1948 war uprooted 700,000 Palestinians from their homes, creating a refugee crisis that is still not resolved. Palestinians call this mass eviction the Nakba — Arabic for “catastrophe” — and its legacy remains one of the most intractable issues in ongoing peace negotiations.Today, there are more than 7 million Palestinian refugees, defined as people displaced in 1948 and their descendants. A core Palestinian demand in peace negotiations is some kind of justice for these refugees, most commonly in the form of the “right of return” to the homes their families abandoned at the time.Israel can’t accept the right of return without abandoning either its Jewish or democratic identity. Adding 7 million Arabs to Israel’s population would make Jews a minority; Israel’s total population is about 8 million, a number that includes the 1.5 million Arabs already there. So Israelis refuse to even consider including the right to return in any final status deal — and now, it seems, the Americans agree with that view.The plan lays out three options for these refugees:1. Absorption into the State of Palestine (subject to the limitations provided below);2. Local integration in current host countries (subject to those countries consent); or3. The acceptance of 5,000 refugees each year, for up to ten years (50,000 total refugees), in individual Organization of Islamic Cooperation member countries who agree to participate in Palestinian refugee resettlement (subject to those individual countries’ agreement).The proposal redraws borders to effectively give Israel more land in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank, in exchange for “land swaps” that include two areas in the Negev Desert. Here’s the “conceptual map” included in the proposal:As you can see, the map gives Israel a large chunk of the West Bank where there are currently a number of Israeli settlements. These settlements in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory are currently illegal under international law and are not considered part of Israel proper. This plan would change that by granting Israel the big section of land they’re built on.The map also shows that Israel would take control of the Jordan River Valley. That’s a promise Netanyahu made to his people last September, and it’s highly controversial.The Jordan Valley runs along the east edge of the West Bank, the heavily Palestinian-populated area taken by Israel in the 1967 war, marking its boundary with neighboring Jordan. It contains both Palestinian population centers, like the city of Jericho, and a number of Israeli settlements.The most credible argument for Israel formally seizing control of this land is essentially strategic. Israel has faced invasions from Jordan before, and an IDF military presence in the Jordan Valley is arguably vital to protecting Israel from a hypothetical future invasion.However, there is no imminent risk of such an invasion to justify an immediate land grab. And there are lots of arrangements by which Israel could protect legitimate security interests in the Jordan Valley without outright seizing the land. It could station some troops there with permission from a Palestinian state, for example.Which means the plan looks simply like a big land grab that would also ruin any hope of a future Palestinian state.Finally, the plan calls for a future state of Palestine to basically never be able to secure itself.“The State of Palestine will not have the right to forge military, intelligence or security agreements with any state or organization that adversely affect the State of Israel’s security, as determined by the State of Israel,” the document reads. “The State of Palestine will not be able to develop military or paramilitary capabilities inside or outside of the State of Palestine.”In other words, a future Palestinian state would not be able to create armed forces to protect itself or fight others. This might seem prudent for Israel’s security, but it would basically leave the state of Palestine at the mercy of Israel’s strong military, giving Israel a greater ability to bully its future neighbor.This is all supposed to add to the economic portion of the peace plan the administration released last June.Dubbed “Peace to Prosperity,” the economic plan was billed as “a vision to empower the Palestinian people to build a prosperous and vibrant Palestinian society.” The administration claimed it had “the potential to facilitate more than $50 billion in new investment over ten years.”But critics slammed the proposal, likening it to a “real estate brochure” — complete with glossy promotional photos from Palestinian aid programs that the Trump administration has cut funding for. Crucially, the plan lacked any details about a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That was by design: Kushner decided to put out the economic half before releasing the political half, saying that releasing the economic bit was “less controversial.” But without that second political half, the economic proposal was essentially meaningless.It’s hard to imagine anyone investing billions of dollars in big infrastructure and transportation projects for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza while the Israeli government continues to annex more and more territory in the former and regularly bombs the latter. The question now is if the political portion satisfies any of those concerns, but experts almost unanimously say that it won’t.No plan was ever going to be perfect. Past administrations, Republican and Democrat, failed to realize a peace deal. Trump’s plan was thus always likely to join theirs on the trash heap of diplomatic history.But this administration’s attempt differed in the way it bluntly sidelined Palestinian interests and leaders while prioritizing Israeli interests. It was less of a negotiation, then, and more of a strong-arming.A hallmark of Trump’s approach to the Middle East is his close personal relationship with Netanyahu and his support for the right-wing government he leads. Their friendship, and Trump’s extremely pro-Israel advisers — from Vice President Mike Pence to US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman to Kushner himself — have led his administration to back many of Netanyahu’s priorities in the region, in some cases overturning decades of US foreign policy and destroying the chance of bringing Palestinians into the process.For example, Trump moved the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May 2018, following through on his promise from months earlier. In March 2019, the US recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel, another massive change in US foreign policy. The Golan Heights, as Neri Zilber wrote for Vox in 2018, is a “strategic area of elevated land situated along Israel’s northern border with Syria. For decades it was part of Syria ... [but] Israel conquered the region during the 1967 war and later annexed it in a move not recognized by the international community.”And last November, Pompeo announced he was reversing a longstanding State Department legal opinion labeling Israel’s settlements in the West Bank as illegal under international law. The new position sharply contradicted mainstream interpretations of the law, the historical US approach to the conflict, and the broader international community’s view of the situation.The announcement sent a clear message to Israeli settlers and its government: Go ahead and keep moving into land that the Palestinians want as a home for their future state. All of that, mixed in with Trump’s order to close a Palestinian mission in Washington and stopping aid for Palestinian refugees, showed just how much Trump favored Netanyahu’s vision for Israel and why Palestinian leaders gave up on the process. But Trump also had a domestic political reason to do all this: Republicans want the US president to show pro-Israel bona fides. There’s been a remarkable surge in pro-Israel sentiment among Republicans over the past several decades. Gallup polling shows that in 1988, 47 percent of Republicans and 42 percent of Democrats took Israel’s side in the conflict with the Palestinians. As of March 2019, that figure is roughly similar for Democrats (43 percent) but dramatically higher for Republicans (76 percent).It is therefore in Trump’s political interest to keep siding with Netanyahu.“Rather than build on previous efforts, the Trump White House has taken measures, such as recognizing Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, and created a plan that serves the interests of Netanyahu, Israeli settlers, and the agenda of the conservative evangelical community in the US — the latter a key part of Trump’s base,” American University’s Ziv said.And that brings us to why Trump wanted to release the peace plan now.Netanyahu is battling corruption and bribery charges while simultaneously campaigning for reelection in March 2020. A November 2019 indictment against Netanyahu covers three different cases, with his alleged offenses including the receipt of inappropriate gifts from a billionaire and corrupt arrangements with media magnates aimed at improving his press coverage. The technical charges are bribery, fraud, and breach of public trust — bribery being the most serious under Israeli law. Jail time is not out of the question: Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert got wrapped up in a bribery scandal during his time in office in the late 2000s and eventually served more than a year in prison.The indictment came at a critical time in Israeli politics: the aftermath of an inconclusive election. Neither Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party nor its chief rival, the centrist Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz, has been able to form a governing coalition. The parties had been in talks to ally and form a national unity coalition, but one of the key sticking points has been Netanyahu himself. He wants to keep the top job in some capacity, while Blue and White leaders have adamantly refused to allow him to do so while an indictment is still on the table.That’s why Israel will have its third election in a year to form a government, with Netanyahu’s and Gantz’s parties still the leaders. This political and legal crisis has left Netanyahu clawing for power. Enter Trump, who with this right-wing-friendly strategy could give his Israeli friend a boost.“The timing of this plan’s release was clearly orchestrated by Netanyahu and his supporters in Washington. It provides an embattled prime minister, who seems to be on his way out, with a major pre-election gift — possibly a life raft,” says Ziv. “It shifts the focus of the Israeli election campaign from an indicted prime minister who may face prison time to a plan that is portrayed as highly favorable to Israel.” “It’s therefore the most blatant interference in domestic Israeli affairs we’ve seen to date,” he concluded.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Will an Israel-Hamas ceasefire happen? The reasons and roadblocks, explained.",2023-11-04,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:What history can — and can’t — tell us about the hope for a Gaza ceasefire.The last time that Israel and Hamas engaged in hostilities that had the potential to ignite a larger war was in May 2021. At the time, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan flew to Cairo and worked with Egyptian officials to negotiate a ceasefire. He drew from his own experience: In November 2012, as an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he and his Egyptian counterparts had locked in a ceasefire after a different outburst of conflict. So I found it revealing about where this war currently stands, and how different it is from the past, when Clinton dismissed any possibility of a ceasefire while speaking last week at Rice University’s Baker Institute. “People who are calling for a ceasefire now do not understand Hamas. That is not possible,” she said. “It would be such a gift to Hamas, because they would spend whatever time there was a ceasefire in effect rebuilding their armaments, creating stronger positions to be able to fend off an eventual assault by the Israelis.” Historically, these ceasefires have worked for both Israel and Hamas, until they haven’t.But the previous logic of Israel-Hamas wars no longer holds after the October 7 attacks on Israel, in which 1,400 people were killed and 242 people were taken hostage. That has fundamentally altered Israel’s security thinking: It now wants to eliminate Hamas entirely. Israel’s existential catastrophe has changed its approach to security, as we’re seeing through its intensive bombardment of Gaza and its ongoing ground incursion, with more than 9,000 Palestinians killed, including 3,000 children. “The technique before was to convince the Israelis that Hamas can be under control,” Nabeel Khoury, a career US diplomat focused on the Middle East who retired as a minister-counselor, told me. “Israelis are way beyond that. They want something much more radical than what happened in the past.” The fact that nearly everyone powerful in the US is also rejecting a ceasefire now doesn’t mean one is impossible. What it shows is that Israel just doesn’t want one, period, and the US has largely followed Israel’s lead. The old paradigm of ceasefires between Israel and Hamas appears to have been broken, but that doesn’t mean that the many examples of the two parties engaging in talks and upholding agreements are not relevant. Even with Israel locked in what it sees as an existential battle with Hamas, the door isn’t, and can’t be, totally closed to diplomacy.There are lessons about who can exert pressure; who has the expertise to work with Hamas; how these talks happen behind closed doors; and, crucially, how the US can play a key role in Israel’s decision-making. With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting Friday that Israel will continue its military operations in Gaza “with full force,” it seems that a ceasefire will only come from a US initiative. Biden hinted as much and discussed the need for a humanitarian “pause” and the release of hostages when interrupted by a protester at a Minnesota event on Wednesday, and the next day Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to the Middle East. As the death toll among Palestinians has grown, the Biden administration has continually readjusted its language with a recognition of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and the need for a political process that would culminate in a Palestinian state. But perhaps the most important lesson to take from those ceasefires past is that they were, in a certain sense, failures: They couldn’t hold in the long-term because they were not tied to a bigger political framework that could lead to a Palestinian state alongside Israel. They ultimately proved unsatisfactory both for the situation of Palestinians in Gaza, and throughout the occupied territories, and for Israel’s own sense of security. That they were ceasefires alone meant they wouldn’t lead to anything that could secure the future for Israelis and Palestinians.However this immediate violence ends — Israel declaring victory, a ceasefire, or something else — ultimately the war will only be resolved by difficult diplomacy and US leadership toward a Palestinian state. Since 2007, Hamas and the state of Israel have existed in a “violent equilibrium,” as Tareq Baconi of the Palestinian research network Al-Shabaka describes it. That year, Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections; Israel then imposed a crippling blockade on the territory. That led to extreme rates of poverty in Gaza; over 60 percent of people need food assistance, and access to health care is extremely limited. About a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza, and nearly 80 percent of youth, are unemployed.“What we see is every few years, or really every few months, a situation occurs where Hamas fires rockets at Israel, when the restrictions of the blockade become too stifling, and essentially force an escalation where a ceasefire is eventually negotiated, and Israel is forced to ease restrictions into the blockade,” Baconi said recently on The Dig podcast. A review of the recent Israel-Hamas wars shows that after each conflict stopped, that violent equilibrium was restored. At times there were peace talks, but they were not really tied to a bigger political process that could lead to a larger settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Israel’s Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009 lasted 22 days. In the conflict, 1,400 Palestinians, among them at least 759 civilians, were killed, as well as 10 Israeli soldiers and three civilians. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice worked to secure a ceasefire. “We need urgently to conclude a ceasefire that can endure and that can bring real security,” she told the UN on January 6, 2009. “This would begin a period of true calm that includes an end to rocket, mortar, and other attacks on Israelis, and allows for the cessation of Israel’s military offensive.” This all came on the eve of President Barack Obama coming into the White House. He initially prioritized talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and put limited pressure on Israel to halt the construction of new settlements in the occupied West Bank. Despite that, little progress was made.That ceasefire held until November 2012, with an eight-day conflict between Israel and Hamas; 167 Palestinians and six Israelis died. Clinton was secretary of state, and Sullivan played a key role in negotiating a ceasefire.That truce broke in the summer of 2014, when a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas left 2,251 Palestinians dead, among them 1,462 civilians, and 67 Israeli soldiers and six civilians. Talks between Israelis and Palestinians had collapsed the spring before and have not relaunched since. Each time, the US and Egypt have played important roles in cementing these ceasefires, even as Egypt and Israel restricted movement in and out of the occupied territory of Gaza. Since the US designates Hamas a terrorist group, it depends on third parties for talks with the militant group. “Negotiating between Israel and Hamas has been one of the niche kind of activities that Egypt specialized in,” Ezzedine Choukri Fishere, a former Egyptian diplomat, told me. “For the last 16 years, the Egyptian policy on Gaza has been a stopgap — de-escalate.” In more recent years, Turkey and Qatar have also held indirect talks with Hamas. When the Biden White House faced another Israel-Hamas conflict in May 2021, US officials followed the playbook from the two wars that happened under Obama — prevent UN Security Council resolutions and work the backchannel with Hamas. The war lasted 11 days in May 2021, killing 230 Palestinians and 12 Israelis. The lesson Biden took from the Obama years was that all clashes with Israel must happen in private if at all, that there should be no daylight between the countries, and that conflict between allies is detrimental to the point of being unbearable.So Biden’s method to ending the May 2021 conflict was quiet diplomacy with Prime Minister Netanyahu. The US blocked United Nations resolutions and stood by Israel, to a point. Biden “held his tongue” when he learned that Netanyahu’s military operation had “no defined objective,” as journalist Franklin Foer recounts in his book The Last Politician. After four phone calls between the two leaders, Biden was blunt to Netanyahu: “Hey man, we’re out of runway here … It’s over.” And then it was.This Middle East war could last longer than any recent previous conflict between Israel and Hamas. The scope of Hamas’s attack, the ensuing Israeli bombardment and ground incursion, and the level of the death toll is already much more drastic than previous rounds of violence. The understandable focus on the destruction of Gaza and the tremendous loss of human life there perhaps obscures what has really happened from an Israeli point of view. “I don’t think there’s enough appreciation of the impact of October 7,” Fishere, who is now a visiting professor at Dartmouth College, told me. “For Israel, this is a new moment. This is not a repetition.”Netanyahu says Israel’s goals are the elimination of Hamas and the return of hostages. But it’s not at all clear how Hamas could be removed with force alone — and should it be, what party would govern Gaza. US and Israeli officials have floated trial balloons in unattributed quotes to the press that include a new Palestinian Authority, Egypt stepping in, or a multinational force, and Biden has urged Israel not to take over the territory. None of those would be good options. Any day-after plan for Gaza would require some buy-in from Hamas leadership — an agreement that its military wing and affiliated forces like Islamic Jihad would drop their weapons. This is the paradox: The ferocity of October 7 has convinced Israeli leadership that it must utterly destroy Hamas, yet there is little evidence it can achieve that goal. In the past, Israel was satisfied with damaging the militant group before settling into a ceasefire state. But this time, Israel is not seeking the kind of cessation of hostilities that defined the end to four previous rounds of conflict. “The only possible ceasefire would be a ceasefire that disarmed Hamas,” Fishere says. “And I don’t think anybody can offer that.”But there is another difference to this war: Hamas is holding 242 hostages, a number that dwarfs previous instances of hostage-taking. That gives Hamas leverage, and pretty much precludes Israel from agreeing to unilaterally stop its assault on Gaza.In public, there seems to be no path forward: Hamas has said that it won’t negotiate over the hostages until there is a ceasefire, and Israel seems to say it would only go for a ceasefire with unconditional release of hostages. What has been floated is a temporary ceasefire — a situation where Hamas’s hostages are exchanged, in essence, for a respite from the fighting and, likely, the release of Palestinian prisoners.The exact mechanics of such exchanges are closely held secrets. The Israeli peace activist Gershon Baskin worked directly with a Hamas interlocutor to secure the release of Gilad Shalit, who in 2011 was exchanged for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners and Hamas members. “Negotiating for the release of hostages may also be less popular this time around,” Baskin wrote in an opinion column for the New York Times earlier this month. The price for the hostages would be just as high as before.Netanyahu says the Israeli military incursion will press Hamas to release the hostages. But for now, Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Gaza has seemingly not encouraged Hamas to release hostages. “My analysis is that this Israeli government has in the most cynical way simultaneously written off the lives of the hostages, while using them as political capital in convincing the world that no one can tell them what they can or can’t do in Gaza,” Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, told me. “The hostages will be released despite the government of Israel, not because of it.”The Financial Times was the first international editorial page to call for a ceasefire. UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the World Food Program, the United Nations secretary general, and the Pope now have, too.Israel categorically rejects these calls. Yet the composite picture is of dwindling international support for Israel’s military campaign, which appears to be putting some pressure on Biden. You can see it in the very gradual shift in action and tone from the administration. Vice President Kamala Harris called for “the urgent need to increase humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.” Blinken arrived in the Middle East and pushed Netanyahu to temporarily pause its military campaign to allow in humanitarian aid. There is no easy way to secure a ceasefire. One is only likely to happen if the US and Israel together felt like enough Hamas leaders have been taken out and their military capabilities sufficiently immobilized, and that there is a chance to negotiate some kind of hostage exchange. While the previously negotiated ceasefires have limited applicability, they do offer faint lessons. One: Third parties like Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey will be integral to the process.Khoury, the former American diplomat who is now at the Arab Center Washington DC, says Qatar may have more power to influence Hamas than Egypt. Earlier this week, the head of the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence services, traveled to Doha. “If Israel and the US would give the Qataris a carte blanche, they can come up with something,” Khoury told me. “But the US and Israel will have to be ready to accept a continued role for Hamas in some capacity. They could say disarm Hamas. But if they wish to obliterate Hamas, Qatar cannot help with that.” Two: The US has to play a major role behind the scenes. At some point, Biden’s team is going to spell out more clearly to the Israelis that the US is not going to countenance this anymore.And, perhaps most importantly, three: There must be a clearer picture of what happens after any ceasefire.“If there’s no political path to deal with the question of occupation, then whatever Israel will do now, regardless of how long it’s gonna take and how many people gonna kill, is not gonna resolve the issue,” Fishere told me. “It will come back and hit us again, at some point in the future, probably not too far.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Israeli troops are in Gaza: 7 big questions about the war, answered",2023-10-10,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:What will “full” war between Israel and Hamas mean? And 6 other questions about the conflict.Israel has launched what appears to be a growing ground invasion of Gaza, after the worst outbreak of violence between it and Hamas in decades. The weeks-old conflict has already claimed over 9,000 lives  as of Sunday, and likely will claim many more. “The second stage of the war” has begun, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced in a press conference Saturday. “[Its] objectives are clear: to destroy the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and bring the hostages home.”[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]Over the previous 24 hours, Israel had expanded its air, sea, and ground assault on Gaza, amid a near-total internet and phone blackout in the territory. Israel has not yet explicitly called this an invasion, and the effort, while growing overnight into Sunday, appears more limited than the full-scale one some experts expected. But Israel repeatedly signaled this weekend that this is a significant ground operation, and troops are actively fighting in northern Gaza. Netanyahu told Israelis to prepare for a “long and difficult” war.The first night of the ground assault, according to one Palestinian who was able to post online, was “the worst night in the history of Gaza.”This flare-up of the conflict began on October 7, when the armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas launched a massive, complex, and well-coordinated attack on Israel early on October 7 from the territory it controls in Gaza. Militants killed more than 1,400 people, including at least 31 US citizens; wounded 4,500; kidnapped over 220 people, including US citizens and many civilians; and fired rockets on Israeli civilians. It was the most devastating and brutal assault Israel had suffered in decades; Israeli officials described it as their country’s 9/11. The horror of the attack only became clearer in the days after, as reports of some — if not all — of the worst atrocities were confirmed. In recent days, the Israeli military shared videos and information with a select group of journalists about the extent of Hamas’s violence. It included grueling stories and imagery about families and children being targeted. In response to the October 7 attack, Israel officially declared war against Hamas one day later. In the weeks since, the country has launched over 8,000 missiles on Gaza, declared a “full siege” of the territory it has blockaded for 16 years, and told Palestinians in the north of Gaza — where approximately 1.1 million people live — that they should relocate to the south. Only after US and international pressure did Israel allow a trickle of trucks with humanitarian aid to enter the country. Thus far, over 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed and over more than twice as many have been injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Though it’s not clear how many of those killed are combatants, at least 3,342 are children. An estimated 1.4 million people are displaced, with about half of them sheltering in United Nations-run facilities. Protests around the world calling for a ceasefire intensified Friday night, and world leaders like UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the EU’s top diplomat made similar calls on Saturday.“Without a fundamental change, the people of Gaza will face an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering,” Guterres’s office said in online statement Friday. Several countries, including Egypt and Jordan, have volunteered to try to defuse the situation diplomatically, and Qatar has been helping lead negotiations to secure the release of Hamas-held hostages and potentially deliver a temporary ceasefire. The Biden administration stood immediately behind Israel after Hamas’s terrorist attack, promising additional military support, sending several US warships and aircraft squadrons into the Eastern Mediterranean, speaking vociferously on Israel’s behalf, and repeatedly visiting the country. The US has also reportedly pushed Israel in private to consider avoiding a full-scale ground invasion that would lead to high casualties and could draw in other regional actors.While telecommunications in Gaza were beginning to be restored Sunday, the lingering effects of the blackout — and the Israeli military’s circumspection about its operations — makes it hard to know the full extent of what’s currently happening in Gaza.Tell us by filling out this form. We’ll try to answer your questions in an upcoming story.We do know there were factors that likely contributed more immediately to this outbreak of violence — months of simmering conflict in Jerusalem and the West Bank over increased Israeli settlements, a far-right Israeli government that has been conducting a de facto annexation of the West Bank, and Arab states normalizing relations with Israel (including a new potential deal with Saudi Arabia) — but also that it is a war decades in the making.Most Gazans are either refugees from the 1948 Nakba, when mass numbers of Palestinians were displaced during the Arab-Israeli War, or descendants of those refugees, said Zaha Hassan, a human rights lawyer and fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. They’ve lived under a strict blockade by Israel and Egypt since Hamas assumed control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, relying on foreign aid to access basic necessities. About one-third of Gazans live in extreme poverty, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. The international community has largely abandoned efforts to find a political solution to this crisis. Now there is likely to be a long, bloody battle causing significant deaths on both sides, with Palestinians set to bear the brunt of the casualties and destruction going forward. Here’s what else you need to know.After a couple of days of fighting to secure its borders after the Hamas attack, and then weeks of heavy bombardment of Gaza, Israel recently ramped up its military operations against Hamas. First, it conducted small, hours-long raids into Gaza with tanks, and then on Friday night began its largest ground assault since October 7.Troops and tanks entered Gaza alongside heavy sea and air attacks. Palestinian journalist Hind Khoudary told Tahrir Podcast that bombardment was continuous throughout the first night.Israel has continued to expand its ground operations. Per analysis from the New York Times, troops have entered Gaza in at least three areas as part of this seeming invasion — two in the north of Gaza and one spot from the east, just north of the evacuation line Israel had set.“We are progressing through the stages of the war according to plan,” Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters Sunday. “We are gradually expanding the ground activity and the scope of our forces in the Gaza Strip.”These operations have turned Gaza into a “ball of fire,” Ashraf al-Qudra, a Gaza health ministry spokesperson, told reporters Saturday. Over 300 people have been killed in designated safe zones, he added, and destruction is widespread. Already, Gaza was suffering a humanitarian crisis because of the siege; hospitals were on the brink of collapse and people were drinking saline groundwater, according to a UN update. Around the same time Israel launched its assault, landline, cellular, and internet communications out of Gaza went largely dark. While a few people with Israeli or international SIM cards, or those with satellite connections, were able to communicate or post online, most were not. That caused not just extreme anxiety for Palestinians inside Gaza weathering the bombardment and those outside trying unsuccessfully to confirm the safety of their family members, but also undermined emergency and humanitarian efforts. Groups like the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Health Organization said they had lost contact with teams on the ground. The WHO said on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, that lack of telecommunications was “making it impossible for ambulances to reach the injured.” Communications were partially restored Sunday. As more information and images started to reach global audiences, the humanitarian toll of the ramped-up assault became clearer.Israel has not explicitly framed this as a full-scale ground invasion, nor is it clear whether the IDF is attempting to seize and control territory or not. Such an operation would be highly fraught for the Israel Defense Forces, which will have to contend with chaotic fighting on Gaza’s dense streets. (So far, the IDF has announced two soldiers have been injured. Netanyahu has been reluctant to put boots on the ground in Gaza since Israel formally withdrew troops in 2005 after 38 years of occupation. But there are indications — like Netanyahu’s press conference, where he framed the war as an existential one, and a video Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi posted Saturday afternoon to X  — that the weekend’s assault might not be the extent of things. “This is a war with multiple stages; today we move on to the next one,” Halevi said in the video. To those ends, Saturday, the IDF posted a video on X urging “all residents of northern Gaza and Gaza City to relocate south immediately” to avoid “intense hostilities” — a message in English to an Arabic-speaking population it seemed unlikely they’d be able to even receive, given the extremely limited telecommunications at the time.It’s unclear what this means for the fate of the over 200 Israeli civilian and military hostages that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants are holding. There had been hope earlier Friday that the Qatari-led negotiations were progressing well, and some analysts argue that Israel’s current operation could be designed to put pressure on Hamas to make concessions in those negotiations. But much remains in flux.—Ellen IoanesPalestinians living in Gaza and Israelis have always been deeply connected. With Israel’s victory in the 1967 War, it conquered Gaza and became an occupying power overseeing the Palestinians living there. (Egypt had controlled the territory from 1948 to 1967.) Israel had not always so severely fenced off Gaza from the rest of the world or blockaded flows in and out of it. For several decades, Palestinians from Gaza worked in the Israeli economy. Starting in 1970, Israel established settlements in the territory and military installations. Israel restricted most Palestinians’ movement in and out of Gaza from the onset of the Second Intifada, or uprising, in 2000.Israel withdrew its security forces and settlements from Gaza in 2005, but the territory nevertheless has remained effectively under Israeli occupation. Hamas won legislative elections in 2006, and amid a violent split with the Fatah-run Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, the Islamist movement assumed control of the territory the next year. Israel has blockaded the territory since. The more than 2 million people in Gaza live in what human rights groups have called an “open-air prison.” The territory’s airspace, borders, and sea are under Israeli control, and neighboring Egypt to the south has also imposed severe restrictions on movement. The United Nations describes the occupied territory as a “chronic humanitarian crisis.” “This pressure being put on Palestinians — it just assumes that they’re insignificant and they will tolerate any degree of humiliation, and that’s just not true,” said Rashid Khalidi, the Columbia University historian.Israel has launched intense military operations on the densely populated territory many times over the past decade and a half in response to rocket attacks from Palestinian militants. The Israeli military has called it “mowing the grass”: a tactic of conducting semi-regular attacks on alleged terrorist cells to take out leaders and new militant groups, which also kill noncombatants and destroy civilian infrastructure in the process. But mowing the lawn almost by definition does not address the root causes of terrorism but only reduces the level of Hamas’s violence temporarily and perpetuates an escalating cycle of violence. Experts say that there is no military solution to the political problem posed by Hamas. Hamas’s wanton violence does not by any means represent the views of all Palestinians. A survey of Palestinians from this summer showed that if legislative elections were held for the first time since 2006, about 44 percent of Gazan voters would choose Hamas. But there has been no opportunity for elections, and so in addition to Israeli military action, Palestinians living in Gaza must endure an unrepresentative government that imposes some Islamic tenets, implements repressive policies against LGBTQ people, and uses abusive policies against detainees.Even as the situation for Palestinians living in Gaza has gotten worse in the past 15 years, less and less attention from world leaders and US administrations has been paid to it. Yet the cause of Palestine — to secure an independent, sovereign, and viable state — continues to galvanize grassroots support in the Arab Middle East and the Muslim world.—Jonathan GuyerAccording to Hamas itself, the attack was provoked by recent events surrounding the Temple Mount, a site in Jerusalem holy to Jews and Muslims alike. Earlier this month, Israeli settlers had been entering the al-Aqsa Mosque atop the mount and praying, which Hamas termed “desecration” in a statement on their offensive (which they’ve named Operation Al-Aqsa Storm).It’s implausible, to put it mildly, that Hamas was simply outraged by these events and is acting accordingly. This kind of complex operation had to be months in the making; Hamas sources have confirmed as much to Reuters.But at the same time, Hamas’s choice of casus belli does tell us something important.Palestinian politics is defined, in large part, by how its leadership responds to Israel’s continued occupation — both its physical presence in the West Bank and its economically devastating blockade of the Gaza Strip. Hamas’s strategy to outcompete its rivals, including the Fatah faction currently in charge of the West Bank, is to channel Palestinian rage at their suffering: to be the authentic voice of resistance to Israel and the occupation. And the past few months have seen plenty of outrages, ones even more significant than events in Jerusalem. Israel’s current hard-right government, dominated by factions that oppose a peace agreement with the Palestinians, has been conducting a de facto annexation of the West Bank. It has ignored settler violence against West Bank civilians, including a February rampage in the town of Huwara.Israel’s focus on the West Bank may also have created an operational opportunity for Hamas. According to Uzi Ben Yitzhak, a retired Israeli general, the Israeli government had deployed most of the regular IDF forces to the West Bank to manage the situation there — leaving only a skeleton force at the Gaza border and creating conditions where a Hamas surprise attack could succeed.There are also geopolitical concerns at work, with some experts arguing this was intended to fundamentally shift how the world approaches Israeli-Palestinian relations. Israel is currently in the midst of a US-brokered negotiation to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, a major follow-up to the Abraham Accord agreements struck with several Arab countries during the Trump administration. Normalization is widely seen among Palestinians as the Arab world giving up on them, agreeing to treat Israel like a normal country even as the occupation deepens. Hamas could well be trying to torpedo the Saudi deal and even trying to undo the existing Abraham Accords. Indeed, a Hamas spokesperson said that the attack was “a message” to Arab countries, calling on them to cut ties with Israel. (It’s worth noting that planning for an attack this complex very likely began well before the Saudi negotiations heated up.)Together, these are all conditions in which it makes more strategic sense for Hamas to take such a huge risk.To be clear: Saying it makes strategic sense for Hamas to engage in atrocities is not to justify their killing of civilians. There is a difference between explanation and justification: The reasoning behind Hamas’s attack may be explicable even as it is morally indefensible.We’ll find out more in the coming weeks and months about which, if any, of these conditions proved decisive in Hamas’s calculus. But they’re the necessary background context to even try to begin making sense of this week’s horrific events.—Zack BeauchampHamas’s attack was well-coordinated, massive in scale, included an unprecedented incursion into Israeli territory, and managed to evade the Israeli security apparatus, which is why it was so surprising — and able to inflict so much carnage.“The Israelis pride themselves on having world-class intelligence, with the Mossad, with Shin Bet, with Israeli military intelligence,” Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, a global intelligence and security consultancy, told Vox. “They do — from the most exquisite human sources to the most capable technical intelligence gathering capabilities [including] cyber and signals intelligence.”As explained above, there are both longstanding and immediate reasons a conflict of some sort was likely. “The message has been clear to Palestinians,” Hassan said. “They can’t wait on some Arab savior and they can’t wait on the US government to act as peace broker — that they’re going to have to take matters into their own hands, whatever that looks like.”But the sheer brutality and devastation has been a shock to Israeli society. Rhetoric from Netanyahu and the IDF has reflected the “vengeance,” as Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, characterized it, that Israeli society is feeling in the wake of the devastating attack. “In a way, this is our 9/11,” IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said in a video statement posted to the social network X on October 8. Videos have circulated showing dead Israelis, as well as Israeli civilians being captured by Hamas militants, presumably to be held in Gaza. Israel’s briefing to journalists earlier this week included videos that showed what the Atlantic’s Graeme Wood described as “an eagerness to kill nearly matched by eagerness to disfigure the bodies of the victims.” Though Israeli towns near the Gaza border are now under IDF control, the full understanding of the horror of the Hamas attack continues to grow, with all but a few of the hostages remaining in captivity and some presumed dead. Hamas had previously threatened to execute captive Israelis if IDF operations strike civilian targets in Gaza without warning, the Associated Press reported. Netanyahu formally declared war on Hamas one day after the attack. That war effort will be governed by a small “war management cabinet” composed of Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition National Unity party who joined Netanyahu in an emergency unity government Wednesday. Gadi Eizenkot, another former army chief, will join the broader security cabinet, potentially an attempt to instill more trust in a government that has widely been seen to have failed at its most important task: to keep Israelis safe.That trust, one poll found, is at a 20-year low. And Israelis’ frustration with Netanyahu seems unlikely to cool: In a post on X Sunday that he’s since deleted, the prime minister blamed the October 7 attack on the security and intelligence services.—EINo one knows how this war will play out. But given Israel’s highly advanced military, its response to Hamas’s attack will be massive and devastating in turn. That’s what Israel has been indicating since the beginning: On October 9, Netanyahu vowed to attack Hamas with a force “like never before” and has vowed to kill every member of the group. The same day, Israel said it would place Gaza under a “complete siege,” and announced it called up 300,000 military reservists, a number that’s now grown by 60,000.“I ordered a complete siege on Gaza. We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly,” Gallant said. “As of now, no electricity, no food, no fuel for Gaza.”Israel on Sunday said it would allow the flow of aid trucks into the territory to “increase significantly” in the coming week; just 94 trucks had arrived since the siege was announced, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. But it’s also important to understand that Gaza has been described as effectively living under siege since 2007, as documented by United Nations experts, journalists, and human rights researchers.What will change is the scale of violence: It has already exceeded the most recent severe conflict between Israel and Hamas in 2021, and is likely to get much worse. Already, Israel has launched what it describes as one of its largest aerial bombardments ever on Gaza. Now, we are beginning to see ground operations, which will likely lead to many more deaths, including fighters on each side. Hamas has an extensive tunnel network that will complicate any Israeli ground effort. The largest number of casualties, though, will likely be Palestinian civilians. Thousands more could die, according to a warning from the UN human rights chief.In 2014, after Hamas conducted a major rocket offensive into Israel, the country responded with a 19-day ground invasion before a ceasefire was reached. During that time, 2,251 Palestinians — including 1,462 civilians — and 73 Israelis were killed in the fighting, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Relations between Israel and Palestinians have always been asymmetrical: Israel, an undeclared nuclear power, has received tens of billions of dollars of US military aid. On October 7, Hamas ruptured Israeli society with wanton violence and mass killing. But it is the Israeli state that retains the capacity to perpetuate an all-out war on the Gaza Strip. Israel has often responded disproportionately to suicide bombings and rocket attacks from Hamas, partially as a deterrent strategy. The result, however, is an intensity of violence in an occupied territory where residents have nowhere to run, and where civilians are regularly killed in Israel’s assaults on Hamas targets.—JGBiden and Netanyahu’s relationship had grown strained over the Israeli leader’s rightward drift and recent judicial overhaul — but after the attack, the US is standing firmly behind its closest ally in the Middle East.“In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere that the United States stands with Israel,” Biden said the day of the attack. Several days later, after his third phone call with Netanyahu, he again denounced the “pure, unadulterated evil” of Hamas’s attack on civilians; he and several high-ranking officials also visited Israel and promised America’s support.The US pledged to send additional military materiel, “including munitions,” according to a news release from the Department of Defense, with the first tranche of security assistance already landed in Israel. In addition to the materiel support, two carrier strike groups, each consisting of an aircraft carrier and multiple guided missile destroyers, along with numerous fighter aircraft squadrons have been deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean to deter other actors like Iran or Hezbollah. However, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said in a briefing on October 10, “There’s no intention to put US boots on the ground.”Some human rights and Middle East experts have criticized US officials for not also prioritizing de-escalation in their public statements, or for not emphasizing the need to avoid further civilian casualties, particularly given the massive civilian casualties Palestinians have endured during previous rounds of violence.In recent weeks, the US’s comments on this have started to modulate just a little; in Israel Biden said clearly that “we mourn the loss of innocent Palestinian lives” and pledged some humanitarian aid. In private, US officials have also pushed the Israeli government to slow its planning — particularly to consider its long-term goals and the risks of potential occupation of Gaza. Those efforts reportedly even included advocating for a narrower, targeted offensive, rather than a full-scale ground invasion. It’s not clear how much that has affected Israeli officials. On Friday, US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby attempted to implicitly distance the US from Israel’s operations, saying that while the US is offering military advice, Israel is in the lead. “They have to drive the strategy that they have developed, operationally and then tactically,” he said.—EIOne of the largest questions going forward is whether this outbreak of violence draws in other countries or groups. The US defense posture, for instance, seems to anticipate escalation from Iran and Hezbollah, the Shia militant group based in southern Lebanon. US statements have explicitly warned other countries from “looking at this as a chance to take advantage” of Israel’s vulnerability, Kirby said.Though there is speculation about Iranian and Hezbollah involvement in the operation, there are no concrete details linking them yet. Generally, “Iran has played a major role in helping Hamas with its rocket and missile programs, and mortar programs,” Daniel Byman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox. And Iran and Hezbollah also provide funding, training, and intelligence to Hamas fighters, all of which could have contributed to last week’s attack, both Byman and Clarke said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Hamas fighters trained in Iran in September. But so far, there is minimal to no corroborated evidence linking Iran to the planning of this attack. The country is walking a delicate line around the conflict: Reuters reported its leaders are trying to support Hamas and Hezbollah and condemn Israel’s actions — as evidenced by an English-language post on X from the president Sunday — while avoiding being drawn into outright conflict itself. Hezbollah initially started firing rockets and guided missiles into Shebaa Farms, territory Israel captured from Lebanon during the 1967 War; the militant group and Israel have continued to exchange rocket fire throughout the month. “Our history, our guns, and our rockets are with you,” Hashem Safieddine, a senior Hezbollah official, said at an event outside of Beirut earlier this month, describing Hezbollah as “in solidarity” with the Palestinian people, Reuters reported. Though there is little indication of a bigger regional conflagration as of yet, it remains a possibility that other Arab nations could become involved — or that efforts to normalize relations between those nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, and Israel could be derailed. On Friday, October 27, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for “an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce.” While 120 countries voted in favor of it, only the US, Israel, and a dozen other countries actively dissented (45 countries abstained). Though UNGA resolutions hold important political weight, they carry no real enforcement mechanisms.As the conflict looks set to continue, there is only one sure thing: The suffering will continue without significant international effort behind a political solution. —EIUpdate, October 29, 12:15 pm ET: This story, originally published October 10, has been updated several times, most recently with information about Israel’s ground incursion.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Israel’s actions in East Jerusalem are a human rights test for Biden,2021-05-10,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:The Biden administration said it wants human rights at the “center” of its foreign policy. Now is its chance to prove that.Weeks of violence in Jerusalem, sparked by Israel’s attempt to evict several Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem, have Democrats, activists, and experts calling on President Joe Biden to speak out forcefully against the American ally’s actions.The problem is he and top members of his team are unlikely to — potentially missing an opportunity to stem the violence and avert a broader conflict.For decades, Israeli pro-settler organizations have aimed to push Palestinians in East Jerusalem out of their homes, dismantle their dwellings, and replace them with hundreds of housing units for Jews. It’s long been a source of simmering tension, and the anger grew to a boil in April as eviction cases continued in Israeli courts, leading Israeli police to increase their presence around the city and tussle with Palestinian protesters.Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday.The standoff has produced troubling scenes, such as Israeli police on Saturday blocking buses of Palestinians traveling to pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam’s third-holiest site, for the holiest night of Ramadan.But there was nothing like the crescendo of violence seen on Monday. Far-right Israelis planned to march through the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City, a provocative annual tradition that celebrates the Israeli capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War — a day known in Israel as Jerusalem Day. But Palestinians don’t like the event because they claim East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed, as the future capital of their sovereign state.Anger at the parade led to intensified conflict between Palestinians and Israeli authorities.On Monday morning at al-Aqsa Mosque, stone-throwing Palestinians took on Israeli police firing rubber bullets and stun grenades. Roughly 330 Palestinians were injured, local health officials said, with 250 hospitalized from the fight.Then, on Monday evening, Hamas, the Islamist militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, fired seven rockets into Israel — with some even setting off air raid sirens in Jerusalem. One rocket reportedly fell just to the west of the capital, damaging some houses.The threat of rocket fire was so real that Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, had to evacuate while in the middle of a session.Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas’s military wing, said the rocket attack was retaliation for what he called Israel’s “crimes and aggression.”“This is a message the enemy has to understand well,” he continued. Hamas had given Israel until 6 pm local time to move its police forces out of the Aqsa mosque compound.Health officials in Gaza afterward said explosions in the region killed 20 people, including three children, and injured around 65 others. The Israeli military later confirmed it had carried out strikes in Gaza.Though militants in Gaza sporadically fire rockets into Israel and are met in turn by Israeli airstrikes, the current tensions have some worried this latest exchange could be the beginning of a larger fight.In a speech, Netanyahu accused Hamas of having crossed a “red line” with the latest rocket attacks and promised a tough response. “Whoever attacks us will pay a heavy price,” he said, warning that the fight could “continue for a while.”The Biden administration has said it’s concerned about the violence in Israel and denounced Hamas’s rocket attacks as an “unacceptable escalation.” But some are calling on Biden to take a more forceful stance and condemn Israel’s actions in East Jerusalem. That might not happen, though, as experts note the political costs of calling out Israel far outweigh the benefits of sticking to the president’s nominally human rights-centered foreign policy.In February, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration would place human rights at the “center” of US foreign policy. “The United States is committed to a world in which human rights are protected, their defenders are celebrated, and those who commit human rights abuses are held accountable,” he said. Calling out Israel’s attempted eviction of Palestinians is the perfect time to show the administration means what it says, experts say.“The world is watching; this issue is important,” said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland. “The administration needs to show it isn’t all talk. They have to demonstrate this principle when it’s hard, not when it’s politically costless.”The US has already made statements on the issue. Last Friday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said, “We call on Israeli and Palestinian officials to act decisively to deescalate tensions and bring a halt to the violence.” Two days later, the White House published a readout of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan’s call with his Israeli counterpart in which he said the administration has “serious concerns about the events in Jerusalem.” But that’s too small a gesture for many, who say it’d be more significant for Biden — or at the very least Blinken or Sullivan — to denounce Israel’s actions on camera.J Street, an Israel-focused liberal advocacy group, released a Monday statement urging the Biden administration “to make clear publicly that Israeli efforts to evict and displace Palestinian families in East Jerusalem and the West Bank are completely unacceptable to the United States, as is the continued use of intimidation and violent, excessive force against Palestinian protesters and worshipers — especially during Ramadan.” Some Democrats in Congress are also putting pressure on Biden. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted on Saturday: “If the Biden Administration puts the rule of law and human rights at the heart of its foreign policy, this is not a moment for tepid statements.” He also linked to a statement by the United Nations high commissioner for human rights that said the evictions could be a “war crime.”Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a progressive leader in Congress, tweeted something similar: “The United States must speak out strongly against the violence by government-allied Israeli extremists in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and make clear that the evictions of Palestinian families must not go forward.Lawmakers in the House, including “Squad” members Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib — a Palestinian American — also backed the Palestinian cause.Biden and other prominent members of his administration so far haven’t openly blasted Israel, instead choosing to condemn the actions of both sides. The University of Maryland’s Telhami said there were good reasons for that, namely that Biden needs Jerusalem’s support to reenter the Iran nuclear deal and the fact that the Israeli-Palestinian issue isn’t top of mind for most Americans.Still, he said, “the problem here is the public profile. When something like this happens, you have to put your foot down.”But the administration is unlikely to, the Middle East Institute’s Khaled Elgindy told me. If they were going to denounce the Israeli government harshly, he said “they would’ve done it by now. Why would they suddenly have a moment of clarity?”Experts said there were other ways Washington could rebuke Jerusalem, such as sanctioning Israel or curbing weapons sales, but none expect any of that will happen. When it comes to the US defending human rights, “Palestine is usually the exception,” said Elgindy, who served as an adviser to Palestinian leadership from 2004 to 2009. “Who’s going to push the Israelis on human rights? It’s not going to be the US.”While inaction is expected, it’s no less problematic, he continued. With no one forcefully and openly calling for an end to the violence, the situation “could very quickly escalate to something that looks like 2014.” A fight that year between Israel and Hamas saw more than 2,100 Palestinians and 71 Israelis killed while over 10,000 people — mostly Palestinians — sustained injuries.If that happens, Elgindy concluded, the US “will have no choice but to get involved.” The irony there is it’s possible Biden’s inaction now could see him wade deeper into a growing conflict down the line.Israel is already showing no sign of backing down. “Israel has no other choice but to defend its citizens from these indiscriminate attacks,” Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the US, said in a Monday statement.And neither is Hamas. Obeida, the spokesperson, said more attacks will come if Israel goes into the Aqsa mosque area again or evicts Palestinian families.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
How to understand Egypt’s role in the Israel-Hamas conflict,2023-10-15,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:The legacy of past conflicts is holding up aid at the Gaza border with Egypt.Under conditions that the United Nations has already labeled a “humanitarian catastrophe,” hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled south in preparation for a potential major Israeli assault on the northern part of Gaza. As the hospitals, homes, schools, and streets of the south fill up with the displaced and injured, time is running out to get lifesaving aid in — or to help people, including hundreds of US citizens, leave.Planes full of medical equipment from the Red Cross and the World Health Organization are at the al-Arish airport in Egypt’s Sinai, some 28 miles away from the Rafah border crossing on Gaza’s southern border, Reuters reported Saturday. Though the aid is critical for the thousands of Gazans injured by ongoing Israeli Air Force strikes since Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, the border crossing remains closed while Egyptian, Qatari, US, UN, and Israeli officials attempt to negotiate an opening. US citizens in Gaza were told Saturday to move closer to the Rafah border crossing, only for them to be unable to evacuate as southern Gaza becomes more and more crowded — and runs low on basic supplies like food, fuel, and medicine. The status of the border crossing has been somewhat muddled; Egypt says its side remains open but that Israeli Air Force bombardments on the Gaza side of the crossing have stopped the flow of traffic and kept the border crossing closed. But Egyptian security officials also told Reuters they are holding up the planned evacuation of some Gazans, including foreign citizens, as they await a deal to allow aid into Gaza. “Every hour these supplies remain on the Egyptian side of the border, more girls and boys, women and men, especially those vulnerable or disabled, will die,” the WHO said in a statement Saturday. As aid negotiations continue, the question of what happens next for Gazans as Israel launches its “next stage” of the war remains: Will powers with competing relationships and interests be able to negotiate some measure of safety for civilians, and will this next phase of the war create more Palestinian refugees, who may never be able to return to their homes? Egypt is central to that question.Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza and perpetrated last week’s attack on Israel, counts Iran as its closest state ally. But the group has a long and complicated relationship with Egypt, too, which makes backchannel, or unofficial, communications possible.Egypt and Qatar have negotiating backchannels with Hamas, Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, told Vox in an interview.“There are backchannels; there always were,” Sachs said. “The main one is with the Egyptians — they have open communication with Hamas. They despise Hamas, of course, and they blockade the Gaza Strip, but their intelligence has frequent communication with Hamas.” This has allowed them in the past to negotiate ceasefires and exchanges between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups, he said.The primary reason Egypt despises Hamas, as Sachs put it, is because it originated as the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group which Ḥasan al-Bannā, a teacher, devout Muslim, and Egyptian nationalist, started in Egypt in 1928. The Muslim Brotherhood began as a religious and educational group focused on providing social services in Egypt; it took as its guiding principle the idea that the Quran and the Hadith — a text most Muslims believe contains the words and traditions of the prophet Muhammad and a basis of Islamic law — should be the foundations of modern Muslim society. The group spread quickly in the Arab world in the 1930s and ’40s, during which time it also became more violent and more politicized. The group’s failed assassination of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in October 1954 initiated a government crackdown, forcing the group underground throughout the 1960s and ’70s.But things were different in Gaza, which Egypt had controlled before Israel took it over in its 1967 war with the coalition of Egypt and Syria. “Ironically, the Muslim Brotherhood [could] now operate” in Gaza, Daniel Byman, a senior fellow with the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox in an interview.And because the Palestinian liberation cause was closely aligned with Arab nationalist and international communist projects during that time, to Israel, “political Islam seemed better than Arab nationalism,” Byman said. The Palestinian left was, in the 1970s and ’80s in particular, the main opposition to the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority under Yasser Arafat. Those secular, Marxist groups were responsible for several terror operations throughout the Middle East at the height of their power. “Hamas comes directly out of the Muslim Brotherhood” in Gaza, “not a spinoff or anything like that. It is the Muslim Brotherhood,” Byman said. For nearly 40 years, the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza, which became Hamas, didn’t have sufficient power to be a threat to Egypt; they didn’t even participate in the First Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, Byman said. But when Hamas gained that power during its takeover of Gaza in 2007, former Egyptian autocrat Hosni Mubarak called the situation a “coup against legitimacy” and supported Israel’s blockade against Gaza. Mubarak was deposed during the Arab Spring, and Egyptians elected Mohammed Morsi, who was affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and hoped to expand relations with Gaza.  Morsi served only a year and four days before he was deposed by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s current strongman president. Sisi has heavily suppressed the Muslim Brotherhood and has in the past vilified Hamas and its connection with the Brotherhood. But he has also coordinated with the group against an Islamic State insurgency in the Sinai, supported relief efforts in Gaza, and mediated ceasefires between Israel and Hamas in previous rounds of conflict. That mediating role also strengthens the US’s reliance on Egypt and Sisi. Still, Egypt’s security concerns are not unfounded; Hamas built several multipurpose tunnels connecting Gaza and Egypt. Those tunnels helped Hamas circumvent the blockade and smuggle in vital supplies like food, medicine, fuel, and construction materials. They are also used to store weapons caches and hide Hamas fighters, and they are difficult to target and destroy. Hamas has also used them to smuggle weapons and perpetrate cross-border raids and kidnappings.  Part of the reason Egypt is concerned about opening the Rafah border crossing is the possibility of extremist elements, including Hamas, coming into the country. But it is also contending with its own internal problems as well as the issue of civilian refugees entering the country without any plan or possibility of return. And Egypt is facing serious internal economic challenges which make the possibility of taking on Palestinian refugees untenable. Egypt already relies heavily on Gulf Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to fill its coffers, help stave off democratic movements in the region, and counter the influence of Iran and Turkey. That unofficial alliance, though, has faltered in recent years over geopolitical and economic disagreements. Egypt has sought a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help alleviate those pressures, but that money comes with its own pressures to make democratic governmental reforms and enact tougher economic policies.Those economic issues also increase the possibility of internal unrest — which an influx of refugees, including some sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood by virtue of ties to Hamas, could exacerbate. Still, it would likely be internally unpopular for Egypt to do nothing to help Gazans, Byman said. “The Egyptian people do not like Palestinians being killed, so the Egyptian government has to recognize some degree of popular concern on these issues. That means working with Hamas in some ways when there is a crisis.”But Egypt also has an evolving relationship with Israel, starting with the Camp David Accords, signed by US President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1978. That relationship has grown from a framework for peace talks to economic and security cooperation that’s important to both sides. Specifically, Israel helps Egypt fight Islamic extremists on the Sinai peninsula and imports natural gas into Egypt, which puts pressure on the Egyptians not to upset that relationship.“The question is, will [the Egyptian government] suffer more from helping or not helping? The goal would be to be seen as helping, but not do much from the Egyptian point of view,” said Byman.There is also the difficult issue of Palestinians’ continued displacement since 1948; most Gazans are the descendants of refugees from the first Arab-Israeli war, which Palestinians call the Nakba, or catastrophe. Palestinians live in diaspora all over the world, including in the US, and in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. For Egypt to be seen as contributing further to that pattern, even given the humanitarian crisis, is undesirable, too.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]Even moving Gazans in desperate need of medical care to Egypt is complicated, Zaher Sahloul, the head of MedGlobal, a medical NGO that operates in crisis zones, told Vox in an interview. “We’re against that as an international organization. We’re against evacuating people from their homeland [so they become] refugees.”There are some developments in the situation as of Sunday, though; Israel has turned on water access in southern Gaza, though Médecins Sans Frontières, a medical group that operates in conflict zones, said in an email statement Sunday that their Gaza teams “report that accessing water is difficult, and is getting worse by the hour. Gaza’s water shortage has now reached a critical threshold.” Without fuel or electricity to run the region’s water treatment plants, “there is now no longer any drinking water being produced in Gaza.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been traveling throughout the Middle East in recent days, as the US and other stakeholders try to negotiate aid to Gazans, as well as safe routes and ceasefires to ensure people can move somewhat safely. “We believe that civilians should not suffer because of the depravity of Hamas,” Blinken told Randa Abul Azm of Al-Arabiya Sunday. “And among other things, that means that they should have food, water, medicine, all the basic essentials that they need.”Blinken met with Sisi on Sunday, and told reporters in a briefing before he headed to Israel that “Rafah will be reopened. We’re putting in place with the United Nations, with Egypt, with Israel, with others, a mechanism by which to get the assistance in and to get it to people who need it.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Palestinians fear they’re being displaced permanently. Here’s why that’s logical.,2023-10-27,Vox,['Sigal Samuel'],"Filed under:In Israel, calls to expel Palestinians have become increasingly mainstream. Many believe an expulsion like the 1948 Nakba is possible.Since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on October 7, 1.4 million people have been displaced in Gaza following Israeli orders to flee south, according to the United Nations. That’s over 60 percent of the Gaza Strip’s population. In wartime, civilians sometimes have to flee an area until it’s safe to return. In the early days following the Russian invasion in 2022, for instance, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fled in search of safety. But many Palestinians worldwide fear that those who are trying to escape the fighting in Gaza will never be able to return to their homes. The displacement, they worry, will become a permanent exile. That helps explain why Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who governs the West Bank, is strongly opposing any plan that involves the mass displacement of Palestinians. Neighboring Arab states Egypt and Jordan are refusing to take in Gazans in part because of security and economic concerns, but also because they say they don’t want to enable such a displacement. “What is happening now in Gaza is an attempt to force civilian residents to take refuge and migrate to Egypt,” said Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, adding that such a displacement would render the idea of a Palestinian state unviable. “The land will be there, but the people won’t.”There are three main drivers of this fear. The first is ingrained in Palestinian memory: In 1948, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were permanently expelled during the first Arab-Israeli war, and intermittent displacements have continued ever since, as Israel has sought to maintain a Jewish majority in the state by pushing Palestinians out. The second driver is what Israeli politicians were increasingly saying in the months before the Hamas attack — their pro-expulsionist rhetoric was so stark that experts warned signs of another mass expulsion were mounting.  And the third driver is what the Israeli defense establishment has been saying since October 7: calling to make Gaza smaller, if not permanently impossible for Palestinians to live in, let alone one day build a state in. Understanding the historical context and what Israel wants today is key to understanding where this war will go tomorrow — and why Palestinians have every reason to fear that the people of Gaza will be displaced forever. Most of the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza aren’t originally from Gaza. They’re the children or grandchildren of the more than 700,000 refugees who were expelled or forced to flee their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 war that led to the country’s creation. This 75-year-old expulsion — which Palestinians call the Nakba, Arabic for “catastrophe” — is not a long-faded memory. It’s a deeply felt, visceral, and ongoing pain.Many Palestinian families still have the keys to the houses they left in 1948. They took the keys with them because they were told by Israeli forces that they would be able to return home after a few weeks. That never happened; instead, they became permanent refugees. (Today, the Palestinian diaspora extends from Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria to the Gulf Arab countries and the West, while some Palestinians are citizens of Israel, making up roughly 20 percent of the country’s population.) These keys came to symbolize what Palestinians call “the right of return” — meaning the right of living refugees and their descendants to return to their original properties. Israel has refused to recognize such a right, fearing that letting in millions of refugees would be a demographic threat — turning the country’s Jewish majority into a minority and undermining the country’s status as a Jewish state.  Now, in a replay of 1948, some Palestinians in northern Gaza in recent weeks have fled their homes with their keys in hand. “I’m taking my house key and thinking, will I ever return to my home?” Arwa el-Rayes, a 56-year-old doctor, told the New York Times before leaving her childhood house in Gaza City.While some in the media are already referring to this as a “second Nakba,” the Palestinians I spoke to said that’s a misnomer because it implies that the Nakba that began in 1948 ever ended.“When people ask if I’m having flashbacks to the Nakba — no, I’m living the Nakba right now!” said Maysoon Zayid, a Palestinian American comedian, writer, and disability advocate. “It’s been an ongoing Nakba since 1948.”Nadia Saah, a Brooklyn-based Palestinian rights activist and creator of Project48, an educational resource about the Nakba, agreed. “We’ve been carrying the generational trauma of our parents — and now, what our parents experienced, we’re watching unfold before our eyes on television,” she said. Saah’s mother fled to Jordan in 1948.Dalia Hatuqa, a Palestinian American journalist currently based in the West Bank, told me her grandfather was killed and her father expelled from Rehaniya in present-day northern Israel — not in 1948, but in 1953, when the Israeli authorities suspected the villagers were getting too cozy with Lebanon, Israel’s adversary to the north. “That shows that the Nakba is something that’s ongoing. It’s something that never stopped. Because people are constantly being expelled.”In 1967, long-simmering tensions in the region erupted into another war, fought between Israel and an Arab coalition made up of Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. Israel captured the West Bank (from Jordan), Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula (from Egypt), and the Golan Heights (from Syria). Roughly 300,000 Palestinians were displaced from the newly occupied territories, mostly to Jordan. Ever since, increasing numbers of Israelis have moved into settlements in the West Bank; these new communities, subsidized by the government, serve the political purpose of creating new “facts on the ground” — a Jewish presence makes the land more likely to go to Israel, rather than Palestinians, in any potential future peace deal. And in the past few years, settlers have grown bolder about inflicting violence against Palestinians and driving them off their land, while Israeli authorities have ramped up demolitions of Palestinian homes under the pretext that they are just enforcing building regulations.Even before the Israel-Hamas war, 2023 was already the deadliest year for Palestinians since 2005. Settler violence was on the rise. And the rhetoric and actions of Israel’s top brass with regard to Palestinian rights became so worrisome that experts warned another Nakba may be imminent.This April, Peter Beinart, a Jewish American journalist who writes frequently about the Middle East, penned a story called “Could Israel carry out another Nakba?” in Jewish Currents magazine. He noted that as Israel’s government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lurched to the far right, the idea of expelling Palestinians has become increasingly mainstream in Israeli society. In a 2017 poll by the political scientist Khalil Shikaki, 40 percent of Israeli Jews said they believed Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in the West Bank “should be expelled or transferred.” By 2021, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was telling Palestinian members of the Knesset, the Israeli legislature, that they were “here by mistake — because [Israel’s founder David] Ben-Gurion didn’t finish the job and throw you out in 1948.” (Former Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, now a member of Israel’s war cabinet, recognized this for what it was, saying “Smotrich wants to cause another Palestinian Nakba — for him, escalation is a desirable thing.”) And by 2022, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, felt emboldened enough to erect campaign billboards reading “May our enemies be banished” below photos of Knesset members from Palestinian parties.While Smotrich and Ben-Gvir (both still in their positions in government) are known extremists, Beinart emphasized that expulsionist sentiment was also flourishing in Netanyahu’s center-right Likud party, with Israel’s current Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, and Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter all alluding to removing Palestinians. Beinart wrote:When Palestinians claim that Israel’s long term goal is not Palestinian statehood but Palestinian expulsion, they aren’t hallucinating … While the pace of Palestinian expulsion has waxed and waned in the 75 years since Israel’s war of independence, there is reason to worry that the radicalism of Israel’s current government, combined with rising violence in the West Bank, could turn the current trickle into a flood. Another Nakba is possible. In a piece in the Nation this past August, Middle East historian Anne Irfan warned that “current conditions in Israel-Palestine show some alarming parallels with the run-up to 1948.” She noted that senior figures in Israel’s far-right government were openly calling for more Palestinian expulsions: One of the worst attacks occurred in February, when around 400 settlers rampaged through the town of Huwara and neighboring villages in the northern West Bank. Setting Huwara ablaze, they left one civilian dead and 100 others injured, four critically. Crucially, this kind of settler violence is not detached from the Israeli state. The Huwara pogrom received open support from some cabinet ministers. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds authority over civilian affairs in the West Bank, tweeted that Huwara should be “wiped out.” National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has similarly feted as “heroes” settlers who attack Palestinians. All in all, Irfan judged the situation to be a powder keg. “All of this means that the risk of a second Nakba is at its highest in 75 years,” she wrote.Less than two months later, Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,400 people and kidnapping over 200. And Israel declared war. Perhaps the most obvious reason Palestinians now fear a permanent displacement is that Israeli politicians have been ever more explicitly floating that possibility since Hamas’s attack, which was so astonishing and gruesome that it awakened intense shock, fear, and rage among the Israeli government, military, and public alike. Here are direct quotes from the Israeli defense establishment this month.  These comments — coupled with dehumanizing rhetoric, like Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s statement that “We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly” — suggest that part of the Israeli defense establishment is not only interested in toppling Hamas (if so, there are better ways than what Israel is doing now); instead, these are explicit calls for permanent displacement and loss of land. So it’s not surprising that some Palestinians have come to believe Israel will take over at least part of the land in Gaza after the war. They are not reassured by more recent comments by Gallant, who said that after the war with Hamas, Israel anticipates ending its “responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip,” such that even the tenuous ties between them — like allowing some Gazans into Israel to work or allowing some goods to enter Gaza — will be cut.   There is such deep disagreement between the Israeli government and the military and such vociferous infighting within the government itself that it seems they lack a unified plan. (The US is reportedly worried about this, and Biden himself warned in a visit to Tel Aviv this month that Israel needs “clarity about the objectives.”) Some Israeli officials may be more narrowly interested in a legitimate military strategy to topple Hamas and defend Israeli citizens, while others further to the right may see in this war a chance to expel more Palestinians.   Experts have outlined a few possible long-term scenarios, all of them bad or unworkable: The Palestinian Authority takes control in the Gaza Strip (extremely difficult given its unpopularity), an international trusteeship governs Gaza with the UN as babysitter (highly unrealistic), new extremist groups spring up to fill a power vacuum (a security nightmare for Israel), or Israel ends up reoccupying Gaza. Short of full reoccupation, which the Israeli ambassador to the US said Israel has “no desire” for, one possibility is for Israel to take part of Gaza’s land to widen the “no-go zone” or “buffer zone” that has existed for several years inside Gaza along the perimeter fence separating the enclave and Israel. (Nobody can live there currently, and Palestinians who come too close to the fence have been shot.) This is what Zayid predicts: “Israel’s going to take that land and be like, ‘Buffer zone,’” she told me. There’s precedent for that: Israel has previously shrunk Gaza in this way when fighting flared up. In 2012, Harvard scholar Sara Roy noted that the buffer zone had absorbed “nearly 14 percent of Gaza’s total land and at least 48 percent of total arable land.” Two Israeli ministers, Gideon Sa’ar and Avi Dichter, have explicitly stated that this is part of Israel’s plan. “On the Gaza Strip all along, we will have a margin,” Dichter said. “And they will not be able to get in. It will be a fire zone. And no matter who you are, you will never be able to come close to the Israeli border.” He added that the width of the buffer zone would have to be decided “according to the distance of the Israeli military or the Israeli settlements.” Gaza is already one of the most densely populated, overcrowded places in the world. Palestinians fear that any loss of territory would make the enclave, which the UN has for years described as unlivable, even more so — unless vast numbers of people are killed or forced out. “The whole idea of the Nakba was to get rid of the people for the land. Killing people was a part of it, obviously, because how do you get people to flee?” Hatuqa, the journalist in the West Bank, said. “What I see now is that it’s ongoing. The idea here is to get rid of as many civilians as possible.”“The Israelis want a game-changing situation and are openly speaking of mass displacement and making Gaza unlivable,” Saah told me. “We should take them at their word.” Regardless of what ultimately happens to the territory, life will never be the same for many people in Gaza, where the death toll has already topped 7,000, according to Palestinian health officials.An analysis of satellite imagery by the Economist suggests that Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have destroyed or damaged some 11,000 buildings — and counting. Per the analysis, “at least 92,000 people will have no home to return to when the fighting stops.” And that will be true no matter what happens next in the Israel-Hamas war.For now, it’s unclear where Gaza’s refugees might go, whether temporarily or permanently. Egypt continues to refuse them entry, but some experts say it’s possible that the Arab nation, which is suffering an economic crisis, may be convinced to relent in exchange for financial incentives. That may save lives, but at the cost of displacement. It’s also possible that the international community, seeing the increasing devastation in Gaza, may be moved to accept refugees; Scotland has offered to be the first country in Europe to do so. US politicians are divided.Ultimately, this chapter of the Palestinian Nakba may or may not beget the same kind of permanent mass expulsion as the chapter that unfolded 75 years ago. But dispossession can happen in other ways, from high death tolls to homelessness.“I’m hoping that they don’t get pushed into Egypt,” Zayid said. “But these people are refugees now. Israel destroyed their homes. They have nothing to go back to.” The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The US’s empty commitment to a two-state solution,2023-02-06,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:An outdated policy stands in the way of efforts to defuse violence in Israel and Palestine.It’s a particularly dangerous moment for Israel and Palestine.Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in the Middle East last week on a previously scheduled trip after 48 hours of violence: a terrorist attack in East Jerusalem killed seven Israelis and an Israeli raid on the refugee camp of Jenin killed nine Palestinians, culminating a month in which Palestinians experienced the highest level of killings at the hands of Israeli forces and Israeli settlers in more than a decade. The situation called for US leadership.Blinken was there to “urge de-escalation,” as the Biden administration described it, at a time when an extreme far-right Israeli government pushes for incendiary changes to the judiciary that contradict Israel’s stated democratic tenets, reorders the way the occupation of Palestinian territory is administered, and pursues a variety of policies that likely violate international law.Yet throughout the trip, Blinken’s comments felt retrograde, like they came from another era. He kept offering up calls for a two-state solution. Since the presidency of Bill Clinton, American policy has focused on creating a sovereign, independent Palestinian state alongside Israel with Jerusalem as its capital, on the land that Israel has occupied since the 1967 war. A version of the two-state solution has broadly been the consensus of Democratic and Republican presidents, the United Nations, and US partners. But recent Israeli governments have expressed little political will for Palestinian statehood. The Trump administration reversed longstanding US policies in ways that undermined Palestine (while still sticking to two states), and Biden’s team has since offered no hints of how to revive the long dormant negotiation process.If the two-state message rings hollow, that’s because the US still has an outdated approach to the Middle East that simply doesn’t acknowledge what’s happened in Israel over the last several decades.The US policy does not take into account how entrenched the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem has become. Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank has made a viable Palestinian state all but impossible. The US-led talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization have been on hiatus since President Barack Obama’s second term, and even at the time, there was little hope that they would amount to much. And Arab states like Morocco, UAE, and Bahrain have abandoned Palestinians, as they normalize relations with the State of Israel and eliminate any incentives for negotiations toward a Palestinian state. Even establishment voices like former Ambassador Martin Indyk, who served as Obama’s Middle East envoy and is now a fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, acknowledge that a one-state reality has set in.To be fair, figuring out a new policy toward Israel and Palestine is no easy task. The US has come to be so dependent on Israel as a close security partner in the Middle East that it seemingly has overlooked its transgressions. Moreover, US politicians are reluctant to overhaul its approach and rankle influential domestic constituencies in the process.But no good policy can rest on an outdated understanding of the facts on the ground. Clinging to a two-state solution that many leading Middle East experts do not view as workable is counterproductive and cedes US leadership. A commitment to a Palestinian state in name only cheapens and undermines its very possibility and boxes out the development of more practical policies that meet the moment. It leaves the US with few options in taking a leadership role in a place that’s central to US national interests and security.So Blinken’s recent trip failed to defuse the tensions. Were it not for the empty words about the two-state solution, he might have had to describe the situation as it is, says Rashid Khalidi, the preeminent Palestinian historian and professor at Columbia University who has researched US presidents in the Middle East. The secretary of state, according to Khalidi, would be reduced to saying, “We don’t care about the Palestinians. We know that Israel is going to do what it wants with them. There will never be an independent, sovereign Palestinian state.” As Khalidi put it, “The moment you admit that the emperor has no clothes, everything changes.”The new Israeli government that took office in January is brazenly exclusionary and illiberal. It has declared in its own guidelines that the “Jewish people have the exclusive and indisputable right to all parts of the Land of Israel,” and it has already taken steps to strengthen settlements and push punitive measures against Palestinians for going to the United Nations and International Criminal Court. But the actions that have foreclosed the possibility of a two-state solution are decades in the making — a trend that has been concealed by the persistence of US politicians discussing Israel and America’s shared democratic values. Successive US administrations have said that there is “no sunlight” between the US and Israel, and that the security relationship is “ironclad.” Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan on a recent trip described the US commitment to Israel as “bone deep.” That narrative is now a much tougher sell with Israel’s undemocratic forces ascendant.At the same time, Israeli settlers number more than 700,000 in the West Bank and East Jerusalem — and they have grown more aggressive. (The village of Khan Al-Ahmar outside Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, for example, has long been under threat of demolition, and now its residents face imminent displacement and dispossession.) Settlers are integrated into Israeli leadership, the military, and security services, and they control part of those services. The de-facto annexation of Palestinian land is the policy of this new Israeli government. Israeli actions, like construction of a hulking, concrete separation barrier between Israel and the occupied West Bank, have rendered the proposed borders of the future Palestinian state moot. Further cut off by Israeli settlements, Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank has been reduced to unconnected cantons, with a network of settler-only roads sometimes being the only connection between them. This brutal new geography puts into question a Palestinian state’s economic viability.Meanwhile, the Palestinian government run by 87-year-old Mahmoud Abbas is fractured, dysfunctional, and increasingly authoritarian. It also essentially is the subcontractor of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. And the Israeli blockade of Gaza represents an ongoing humanitarian disaster. The conditions are set for what may be an unpredictable wave of resistance, perhaps in the form of a third intifada (or popular uprising) with a generation of Palestinians having little prospect of being enfranchised. “The tolerance of the Palestinians for outrage and for incessant humiliation and for systematic murder of Palestinians, most of whom are always invariably civilians, is growing more limited,” Khalidi said. “And that means the situation is actually more explosive.” The domination of the Israeli far-right, the expansion of Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, and divisions among Palestinian political leadership mean that there is no peace process. There may never be another one. Fifty-two percent of Middle East scholars, according to a 2021 survey, say a two-state solution is no longer possible. For 59 percent, the current circumstance is “a one-state reality akin to apartheid,” which leading Israeli, US, and international human rights organizations have also documented.  There are some in the US who recognize this reality: Young American Jews are less likely to unconditionally support Israel than previous generations. Black Lives Matter activists link the struggle for rights in Palestine with those disenfranchised in the United States. A movement pushing to boycott, divest from, and sanction Israel shows what the next phase of peaceful protest against Israeli policies might look like — and the result has been laws in 34 states that seek to ban the right to boycott when it comes to Israel. The US establishment, however, is striking back against these voices and enforcing red lines around the conversation around the Middle East. Even pointing out the current untenability of an end to Israeli occupation and a sovereign Palestinian state can hurt one’s career in Washington. That’s what happened to Sarah Margon, an accomplished former congressional staffer and rights advocate, whom President Biden appointed to the top human rights position at the State Department. That assistant secretary role requires Senate confirmation, and for almost two years, the Republican ranking member of the committee refused to move her nomination forward — because of a tweet. In 2018, Margon praised Airbnb for removing listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Though Margon is Jewish and the ranking member, Sen. James Risch (R-ID), is not, Risch accused her of antisemitism and used it as a pretense to hold up her moving out of committee. After being frozen out, Margon recently withdrew from the role, and the US State Department still lacks a top human rights official.All the while, the US strengthens its relationship with Israel as its government pursues policies that are more and more extreme. Before Blinken’s visit, the US and Israel conducted a military exercise that looked like a dress rehearsal of a war with Iran — and distastefully created a video-game-like highlight reel of it — as Israeli settlers escalated violent attacks on Palestinians.Could US policy toward the Middle East be at least a little more realistic and address how dangerous this moment is?“We continue to believe, as the president said on his trip to Israel and the West Bank last summer, that two states — based on the 1967 lines, with mutually agreed swaps — remains the best way to achieve our goal of Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace and security,” a State Department spokesperson wrote by email. “And, of course, it’s vital to preserving Israel’s identity as a Jewish and democratic state.”  The State Department spokesperson conceded that currently “the prospects of a two-state solution feel remote,” though they emphasized, “we are committed to preserving a horizon of hope.”More US policymakers should clearly acknowledge just how limited the possibility of a two-state outcome is. A “do no harm” approach is a better guiding principle than the current two-state word salad that will only further undermine US credibility in the Middle East.Or else, to show that the Biden administration is indeed committed to an independent Palestinian state, it should state clearly what it’s actively doing to advance that. To start, allowing a Palestinian diplomatic office to open in Washington and re-launching a US consulate in Jerusalem for Palestinians, undoing Trump policies that undermined Palestinian representation.Even if the US remained committed in name to the two-state solution, there are plenty of things Blinken could have said or done during his trip to show that the United States was willing to use its leverage to adjust to the dangerous status quo. He could have hinted that the use of American weapons is in violation of the Leahy Law for purposes that aren’t defensive. He could have cut off the use of 501(c)3 charities that send US money to illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. He could have said that the US might no longer stand up for Israel in international forums like the United Nations Security Council or the International Criminal Court. But the reality is that the US remains complicit in some of the Israeli government’s most destructive policies. “These are American weapons, paid for with American tax dollars, $3.8 billion of them every year, that are used to gun down Palestinians, mainly civilians,” Khalidi explained.Blinken said his first priority on the Middle East trip was to “calm things down.” Speaking to reporters, he explained, “my hope is that if that succeeds, then we can look to both sides to take some positive steps to try to rebuild confidence, rebuild trust, and that in turn lays the foundation for at some point pursuing two states.” By most accounts, he failed to accomplish the first half of that equation, and the mythical two-state outcome is as far off as ever. In reality, those who push for it, without anything to back it up, are only prolonging and perpetuating an endless conflict.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"At the United Nations, Biden is still trying to convince the world America is back",2021-09-21,Vox,['Jen Kirby'],"Filed under:But the test isn’t whether America is back — it’s whether it can help build the world Biden says it wants to build. In the first United Nations General Assembly of his presidency, Joe Biden assured leaders that America was ready to work together on global challenges — from the Covid-19 pandemic to climate change to the preservation of democracy and human rights.“This is the clear and urgent choice that we face here, at the dawning of what must be a decisive decade for our world, a decade that will quite literally determine our futures,” Biden said Tuesday in New York City. “As a global community, we are challenged by urgent and looming crises, wherein lie enormous opportunities if — if — we can summon the will, and resolve to seize these opportunities.”If it sounds familiar, it should. Biden, since his 2020 campaign, has promised to deploy American leadership to help solve the world’s problems, and to do so alongside allies and partners. He has repeatedly framed his presidency as a defense of democracy in a global struggle against authoritarianism. He did both again Tuesday. He talked about the need to untangle the United States’ reliance on military power and use other diplomatic and humanitarian tools instead. He referenced many international organizations — like the World Health Organization — that the US is reengaging with. The United States, Biden said, was “back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and to spur global action and shared challenges.”This vision has always been a deliberate contrast to former President Donald Trump’s “America First” worldview. But Trump is out of office (for now). Biden alone has the power to deliver on his promises of cooperation, of democracy, of human rights — and allies are judging him not compared to the previous president, but on his and his administration’s actions alone.Biden’s half-hour UN speech was clear-eyed about many of the challenges the world faces. “As we look ahead, we will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from Covid to climate, peace and security, human dignity, and human rights,” Biden said. “But we will not go it alone. We’ll lead together, with our allies and partners and in cooperation with all those who believe as we do.”Biden used this cooperative vision to also frame some foreign policy priorities — among them, competing with China (though he avoided bringing up Beijing directly), reentering the Iran nuclear deal, pushing for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, and denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. It was, in all, a wish list of things that require some mix of diplomacy, multilateralism, and compromise. Biden explicitly rejected the use of military force to achieve these goals, a theme that stood out a month after the US’s Afghanistan withdrawal. “US military power must be our tool of last resort, not our first. It should not be used as an answer to every problem we see around the world,” Biden said. “Many of our greatest concerns cannot be solved or even addressed through the force of arms. Bombs and bullets cannot defend against Covid-19 or its future variants.”But there are still many questions about how Biden will fulfill these commitments on climate change, on Covid-19, and on everything else. At the United Nations, Biden, once again, offered an optimistic view of the capacity of the world to work together, and a generous view of America’s role in it.  But that rhetoric has not always matched Biden’s foreign policy reality to date. For example, though Biden is raising the US refugee cap to 125,000 as of this fiscal year, in Afghanistan, tens of thousands of allies were likely still left behind, and the administration is deporting Haitians at the southern border and returning them to uncertain futures. The withdrawal from Afghanistan also raised questions among allies about whether the US did enough to consult with them, and the US’s new deal with the United Kingdom and Australia over nuclear submarines shows America is still flexing to counter China, while angering France, another close ally, in the process. This is even true on some of the big, existential challenges that the world faces and that, as Biden rightfully says, are impossible to solve alone. On Covid-19, Biden reiterated his administration’s commitment to a pandemic response, saying the administration has sent more than 160 million vaccine doses abroad. This week, Biden is hosting a Covid-19 summit, which will draw more commitments from allies and partners to achieve what Biden said are three goals: “saving lives now, vaccinating the world, and building back better.” At the same time, the US is debating whether to give out booster shots, which the World Health Organization has said should not be a priority because of unequal vaccine access around the world. About 6 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, the vast majority in higher-income countries. Just 2 percent of the population in lower-income countries has received a first dose. Covax, the international effort to equitably deliver vaccines, reduced its targets for delivery this year.On climate change, Biden reiterated the emergency and repeated the US’s climate commitments under the Paris climate agreement. But actually achieving some of these goals requires real policy steps, and a lot of that depends on Congress. Right now the future seems uncertain for the Democrats’ big bill on climate, social spending, and more — and that could endanger the scaled-down bipartisan infrastructure and climate bill, too.Biden also reflected on the values of the United Nations, human dignity and rights. “As we face down violence and insurrection, democracy remains the best tool we have to unleash our full human potential,” Biden said in what sounded like a reference to the US’s internal struggles. He tried to frame Afghanistan as an end to a chapter of the war on terror, although the fallout in Afghanistan and in so many other countries is likely to continue; Biden also acknowledged this by saying the US would take action against terrorists when it thought necessary.Biden, before the UN, says “terrorists” can “continue” to expect the US to launch lethal strikes, just not large-scale ground conflict. Then declares this is no longer 2001. This is a reification of the Sustainable War on Terror, down to the rhetoric of ending the enterprise.Biden has promised cooperation and commitment, and no matter who is president, there are always limits to this. United Nations speeches are often built on a certain kind of idealism, just like the institution itself. But presidents choose the themes important to them. Trump was “America First”; he talked sovereignty and self-interest. Biden presented himself as the alternative to that. But the alternative isn’t Trump, it’s to Biden himself. The test is not whether America is back, but whether it can help build the world Biden says it wants to build.

Would better regulations and equipment mandates have prevented the Ohio rail disaster?,2023-02-18,Vox,['Jariel Arvin'],"Filed under:Frequent derailments may also signal a need for more rapid deployment of infrastructure investment.In the aftermath of the train derailment and hazardous chemical spill that happened on the evening of February 3 in East Palestine, Ohio, questions linger about the cause of the accident and officials continue to lay blame on one another. While residents worry about the safety of the air and water as they return to their homes, questions about regulations and infrastructure funding linger.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Federal Railroad Association are launching an investigation but it could take months — or even years — for officials to determine what caused the accident. Still, the NTSB has promised it will deliver a preliminary report of its investigation within two weeks. Surveillance footage seemed to capture video of the train’s wheel bearing overheating almost 20 miles away from where the train went off the tracks.   As Vox’s Umair Irfan explained: “Rail workers, government officials, and industry analysts have long warned that such disasters are an expected consequence of an industry that has aggressively cut costs, slashed its workforce, and resisted regulation for years.” Since returning to East Palestine on February 8, residents have reported symptoms including nausea, headaches, and rashes. At a recent town hall, community members demanded answers to questions about the long-term health impacts of exposure to the chemicals. Norfolk Southern representatives weren’t in attendance for that meeting but CEO Alan Shaw did meet with town officials on Saturday. “We know we will be judged by our actions, and we are taking this accountability and responsibility very seriously,” Shaw said in a prepared statement. This follows another statement from Norfolk Southern on Friday that they are “committed to coordinating the cleanup project and paying for its associated costs.”Despite assurances from EPA Administrator Michael Regan and Governor Mike DeWine, it’s unclear if the air and water are safe because air quality monitors lack the sensitivity to detect low-level particles. Even more concerning, Delphine Farmer, a chemist at Colorado State University told Vox’s Benji Jones, is that scientists don’t really know what level of exposure is safe over the long term. Governor DeWine has said water is safe, but encouraged people with wells to drink bottled water. So far, residents have filed at least six class action lawsuits against the rail operator. Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg blamed the Trump administration for rolling back an Obama-era rule that required operators carrying hazardous chemicals to employ better breaking technology. His statements came as Republicans claim that Buttigieg’s department and the Biden administration have been dragging their feet.“We’re constrained by law on some areas of rail regulation (like the braking rule withdrawn by the Trump administration in 2018 because of a law passed by Congress in 2015), but we are using the powers we do have to keep people safe,” Buttigieg said Tuesday. Even Democrats are calling for a more robust response. While noting the potential for long-term health effects from the spilled chemicals, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) urged more action. “We need Congressional inquiry and direct action from Secretary Buttigieg to address this tragedy,” Omar tweeted.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio wrote a letter on Thursday to President Biden calling for Buttigieg’s resignation. “The circumstances leading up to the derailment point to a clear lack of oversight and demand engagement by our nation’s top transportation official,” Rubio wrote. On Friday, the White House stood behind its response to the crisis, stating that a team from the EPA arrived within hours of the derailment and that the Department of Transportation was quickly on the ground as well and was committed to sending additional assistance.“Today, in response to Governor DeWine’s and the Ohio congressional delegation’s request on February 16 for additional federal public health support, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they are deploying a team of medical personnel and toxicologists to conduct public health testing and assessments,” the statement said.Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump, who has already announced plans to run for president in 2024, told Fox News that he will be visiting East Palestine on Wednesday to speak with residents. The White House is weighing whether to file civil lawsuits or impose fines on Norfolk Southern to make sure the rail operator makes good on its promise to pay for the cleanup costs. Experts, however, don’t think fines will encourage wider changes to the rail industry.“[Railroad companies] have an army of lawyers that would fight tooth and nail to reduce any penalties,” Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at USC said. “That’s why I say punishment and fines won’t force them to become better and safer,” Meshkati added that encouraging a culture shift within the boards of these companies is what is needed.Steven Ditmeyer, a former senior official at the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), told The Lever that existing safety measures could’ve lessened the impact of the disaster if they had been mandated. Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) breaks, which Norfolk Southern had previously promoted as having “the potential to reduce train stopping distances by as much as 60 percent over conventional air brake systems,” were later heavily lobbied against by Norfolk Southern’s own lobbyists. “Would ECP brakes have reduced the severity of this accident? Yes,” Ditmeyer said. “The railroads will test new features. But once they are told they have to do it… they don’t want to spend the money.”Norfolk Southern recently had also been lobbying against minimum crew rules, which would have mandated each train have two crew members, something federal regulators have argued would help reduce the severity of derailments and other accidents. While it’s unclear at this moment if the cause lies with equipment failure of the train itself or the track it was traveling on, according to an article from 2015 by Scientific American, broken or degraded tracks are the most common cause of train derailments, accounting for as much as 15 percent of all derailments. And while the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure package allocates $66 billion to enhancements to the US rail system — including $2 million for research into the impacts of longer trains on derailments — followed by a smaller investment in June 2022 by the Biden Administration which awarded $368 million for rail improvement projects, it could take years for the improvements to filter out. Still, the need for urgency is apparent, as between 1990 and 2021, there were an average of nearly 2,000 train derailments per year, according to federal data. While just 10 percent of railroad derailments involved hazardous materials, according to a USA Today analysis there has been a 36 percent increase in hazardous materials violations caught during inspections over the past five years.The thought of trains continuing to haul dangerous chemicals — over 2 million carloads in 2021 — through American backyards might be hard to stomach, but it continues to be safer and more cost-efficient than transport by air or road. However, without significant changes to both regulations and infrastructure, incidents like the one that happened in East Palestine will keep occurring. Indeed, that derailment isn’t even the most recent — on Wednesday, a freight train went off the tracks in Michigan. Luckily, the car carrying hazardous materials wasn’t derailed.

What’s behind the anti-Semitism surge in the US,2021-06-02,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Violent anti-Semitism spiked in America during the Israel-Hamas war. And we don’t know why.Recently, my mom sent me a text with a link to a story about a gang assault targeting a Jewish man in New York. “I’m worried for you,” she said.I regularly wear a kippah, a traditional Jewish head covering. It’s people like me, Jews who anti-Semites can readily identify, who have been targeted by high-profile attacks in cities like New York and Los Angeles in the past few days — beaten while walking down the street, attacked while out to dinner, and even assailed by fireworks tossed out of a car.These attacks appear to be linked to the recent flare-up in fighting between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. In some cases, the perpetrators waved Palestinian flags or shouted pro-Palestinian slogans. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish civil rights group, found preliminary evidence that anti-Semitic incidents, ranging from harassment to vandalism to assault, increased by 75 percent during the recent conflict.The ADL’s data has some problems: It might be overstating the current level of anti-Semitic animus. But the upsurge in anti-Semitic assaults linked to anti-Israel sentiment, in particular, seems new and different, and it is not something that typically happens in the US during fighting between Israel and Hamas. “The violence ... is one of the things that make this go-around a little bit different,” Oren Segal, the vice president of the ADL’s Center on Extremism, tells me. What’s less clear is why these incidents are happening.It’s entirely possible that it’s random chance, isolated incidents that mean little in the broader scheme of things. It’s also possible that the anti-Semitic attacks are part of the generalized surge in American anti-Semitism since 2016, which most experts link to the rise of Donald Trump and the alt-right movement. But perhaps the scariest possibility is that the US is becoming more like Europe, where anti-Semitic violence during military conflicts involving Israel routinely rises.One thing, though, is clear: The American Jewish community is on edge. It’s a feeling that’s become sadly familiar since the 2018 attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday.With any reported uptick in hate crimes, it’s important to start by asking whether the number of incidents has really increased or whether the crimes are simply getting more attention. Viral videos galvanize public outrage, but the data on the subject is notoriously difficult to compile accurately. Government data is spotty, and it can be very difficult to distinguish whether a crime that targets a member of a marginalized group is actually motivated by hate.The ADL’s data is the most commonly cited non-government metric of anti-Semitism in the United States, often taken as authoritative. Its information is granular and swiftly updated, allowing researchers to separate out what was happening before and after the Israel-Hamas conflict began on May 10. By its numbers, there’s a clear break and rapid increase after the onset of hostilities.But when you look under the hood, the numbers are a little bit more complicated. A recent article by Mari Cohen in Jewish Currents, a left-wing Jewish magazine, points out that the ADL’s tracker includes recent incidents that are only dubiously anti-Semitic — like a sign at a pro-Palestinian protest with the slogan “Zionism is racism. Abolish Israel.”The expansive definition of what qualifies as an “anti-Semitic incident” is, as Cohen points out, a longstanding and well-known problem with the ADL’s data. In his book The Jewish-American Paradox, Harvard’s Robert Mnookin argues that the ADL “plays an important role in keeping both Jews and policymakers aware of the risks of anti-Semitism, both in American and worldwide, but often exaggerates those risks in language the mainstream media typically quotes verbatim.” Yet even when put under a microscope, the current numbers are concerning.Cohen redid part of the ADL’s math, looking at 43 recent cases in the ADL’s public tracker and excluding “incidents in which the ADL’s determination of antisemitism is controversial, including protest signs with anti-Zionist content or Holocaust comparisons.” Under her approach, there’s a drop in the overall number of incidents, but an even larger increase in percentage terms. While the ADL reports incidents increasing by 75 percent during the Israel-Hamas conflict, Cohen’s math suggests “more than a doubling.”She also notes that the handful of violent incidents — the assault in Times Square, the beating of Jews out to dinner at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles, Jews in Florida pelted with refuse, among a few others — are relatively new. “To my knowledge, we haven’t seen these attacks on Jews before during moments of mass protests on the street,” Ben Lorber, an analyst at the left-wing Political Research Associates think tank, tells Cohen.During previous conflicts, the ADL has been deeply concerned by what it sees as anti-Semitic rhetoric at pro-Palestine protests. But this time around, Segal tells me, the language at these events has been relatively measured. “We haven’t seen the massive amount of anti-Semitism at these rallies as we’ve seen in the past,” he says. “There is a toning down of most protests ... that, in the past, would be overwhelmed by inflammatory messages.”This suggests that the ADL’s current numbers aren’t merely a reflection of an overly expansive definition of anti-Semitism. But it also poses a difficult question: Despite the toned-down rhetoric at mass rallies, why does there appear to be a link between the conflict in Israel and the anti-Semitic violence in America?In LA, the attackers — who drove to a specifically Jewish neighborhood to find Jews to hurt — were flying Palestinian flags. In Times Square, the violence grew out of a pro-Palestinian protest. In Florida, the attackers yelled, “‘Free Palestine, fuck you Jew, die Jew.”This isn’t normal. Something new appears to be happening, but it’s not yet clear what it is.Because we’re less than two weeks removed from the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, it’s very hard to draw clear conclusions as to why anti-Semitism spiked in America during the fighting. We can’t even be sure the wave of anti-Semitism has crested — it’s possible things will get worse rather than better.But here are three different hypotheses, none of which are proven, but each plausible and consistent with the information we have so far. The first theory is also the simplest: These are isolated incidents and not reflective of any deeper trend. The number of violent assaults targeting Jews every year is very small, in the dozens rather than hundreds. When your sample size is that small, a few incidents can take on outsize importance. The attackers may have claimed to be acting on behalf of the Palestinian cause, but ultimately, there may be no systematic reason to think that the increase in public pro-Palestinian sentiment is in any way linked to anti-Semitic violence.This is, more or less, Cohen’s conclusion in her Jewish Currents piece. “Given an American Jewish population of 7.6 million, [this is] hardly an epidemic,” she writes. “The ADL’s narrative also serves to reinforce lurking anxieties that advocacy for Palestinian rights is inherently antisemitic — even as Palestinian leaders have condemned antisemitism publicly and repeatedly.”A second theory is that what we’re seeing right now is, more than anything else, a reflection of an upswing in anti-Semitism that began during the Trump campaign and presidency.There is little doubt that anti-Semitic sentiment in America began spiking in 2016. The ADL and other data sources suggest a surge beginning then, most commonly linked to the alt-right’s rise on Trump’s coattails, and continuing for the next four years. The violence has been severe.In October 2018, a far-right gunman killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh — the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US history. In April 2019, another anti-Semitic shooter targeted the Chabad synagogue in Poway, California, killing one. In December 2019, amid a wave of assaults targeting visibly Jewish men in Brooklyn, a man wielding a machete attacked a Hanukkah party in the New York suburbs, killing one and injuring four.In a 2021 paper, scholars Eitan Hersh and Laura Royden tried to isolate what kinds of people, exactly, were attracted to anti-Semitic ideas in modern America. They found that three groups — white conservatives, Black Americans, and Latinos — were disproportionately likely to agree with anti-Semitic statements like “Jews have too much power in America.” Among Black and Latino people, those who self-identified as conservative politically were also more likely to display anti-Semitic attitudes. Anti-Semitism was generally higher among younger Americans than older ones.The connection between anti-Semitism and pro-Palestinian sentiment in Hersh and Royden’s data is tenuous at best. Among those who said Jews had too much power in America, only a small percentage pointed to Israel-Palestine as the area where they wield this malign influence — suggesting to Hersh and Royden “that support for these statements is not closely connected to the Israel/Palestine conflict.”At the same time, anti-Semitism tends to travel across the fringes of the political spectrum. It’s possible the explosion in online anti-Semitic expressions from white nationalists, for example, influenced a small subsection of Palestinian sympathizers. This tracks with the age demographics in Hersh and Royden’s study — younger people get more of their information online.“A huge difference between now and [the Israel-Hamas war in 2014] is the online environment,” Segal says. “Despite the constant concerns raised about anti-Semitism and bigotry of all kinds and extremism on these platforms, we saw an explosion of anti-Semitism ... which further normalizes anti-Semitism.”Third, it’s possible we’re seeing the beginning of what might be termed the “Europeanization” of American anti-Semitism.While upswings of violent anti-Semitism during Israeli-Palestinian conflicts are relatively rare in the United States, they’re common in Western Europe. Data from the Kantor Center at Tel Aviv University shows that, during the 2008-’09 Gaza war, there was a massive spike in anti-Semitic violence, death threats, and vandalism worldwide — with a high percentage concentrated in European countries with sizable Jewish populations like France. During the current conflict, early data from the United Kingdom showed a 600 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents.The link between anti-Israel and anti-Semitic attitudes in Europe is fairly well established. A 2006 study by Yale’s Edward Kaplan and Charles Small found that, in a survey of 500 Europeans, “anti-Israel sentiment consistently predicts the probability that an individual is anti-Semitic, with the likelihood of measured anti-Semitism increasing with the extent of anti-Israel sentiment observed.”It’s possible this connection is deepening in the United States, that people with anti-Israel views are increasingly more likely to blame American Jews for what they see as Israeli wrongdoing and are more likely to inflict physical violence upon them as a result.But one salient difference between the United States and Europe is the status of Muslims.Many of the perpetrators of anti-Semitic violence in places like France are from alienated and socially marginalized Muslim communities. American Muslims by contrast, tend to be more tightly integrated into American society. Moreover, American Muslims and Jews tend to have positive views of each other despite disagreements on Israel-Palestine. For these reasons, communal violence during Middle East flare-ups is much rarer in America.“In parts of Europe where you have bigger Muslim populations, you have this,” Hersh tells me. “But we haven’t seen that kind of violence in places [in the US] with bigger Muslim populations.”The identities of many of the recent attackers in the US right now have not been confirmed. Though the names of at least four people arrested in conjunction with the New York and Los Angeles disturbances have been released, it’s difficult to draw firm conclusions about how and why they got involved in the violence until more information is made public.But the fact that some of these incidents seem directly tied to pro-Palestinian events and sentiment, with little or no connection to the far-right factions that traditionally commit the most serious anti-Semitic violence in the United States, presents troubling data points. It’s possible, if not likely, that the European pattern of violence in Israel causing anti-Semitic violence at home could become a reality in America.It’s far from clear which, if any, of the three explanations presented above will turn out to be the correct one. And they aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive.But what’s clear now is the Jewish community is once again confronting the fact that anti-Semitism is alive and well in America. A Pew survey of American Jews, conducted in 2020 and released in May, found that three-quarters of American Jews believed there was “more anti-Semitism in America than there was five years ago.” Fifty-three percent said they feel personally less safe as a result.The current wave of violence will do nothing to assuage my agitated community — one with very good historical reasons to fear for our safety.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Netanyahu and the far right have triumphed. Here’s what it means for Israel.,2022-11-02,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:The radical rightward shift of the Israeli body politic, explained by an expert.As votes are being tabulated in Israel’s fifth election since 2019, Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition has taken the lead, meaning he is likely the country’s next leader. He’s been prime minister several times before, but there’s something different this time — and it’s not only that he’s under investigation for serious corruption charges.Bibi Netanyahu is poised to lead a coalition that is more ideologically unified and further to the extreme right than previous coalitions he’s led. His Likud party has become more radical, and so have the parties it’s willing to build a government with. Some members of his likely parliamentary majority believe in Jewish supremacy and support racist policies that may ultimately change the way the state of Israel protects the rights of its citizens, whether Palestinians who hold citizenship or leftists, activists, and critics who seek equal rights for Palestinians in the occupied territory.The other big winner is Itamar Ben-Gvir of the Jewish Strength Party, who is a keystone of Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition and a radical lawyer who espouses a Kahanist worldview (Rabbi Meir Kahane was an American-born extremist ideologue who was an Israeli parliamentarian in the 1980s).To understand the complexity of the Knesset — Israel’s parliamentary system — and its radical shift toward extremism, I spoke with Daniel Levy, a keen observer of Israeli politics and former negotiator for the Israeli government in its peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization. He’s currently the president of the US/Middle East Project. Levy’s major takeaway: “It’s important to not fall into the trap of just seeing this as an aberration. It might be an ‘upgrade’ in extremism, but I think it’s correct to place this on a continuum of the absorption into Israeli politics of the most extreme.”Netanyahu and President Joe Biden, it also might be noted, have a long history. One of my first jobs out of college, in 2009, was working as a researcher on Levy’s team at a think tank, as we thought through how then-President Barack Obama might approach Israel-Palestine. The rockiness of the Obama-Netanyahu relationship cannot be understated. Obama sought a partial freeze of Israeli settlement growth in the occupied West Bank, but when then-Vice President Biden arrived on a trip to Israel, Netanyahu snubbed him and US policy by announcing the expansion of new settlement building in East Jerusalem. I asked Levy about what another Netanyahu premiership would mean for America’s relationship with Israel, its closest Middle East partner. Though the prospects for an independent and viable Palestinian state seem less likely than ever, Levy offered a small dose of optimism. Since Biden has already visited Israel as president, he may have the clout and the cred to offer hard truths to an Israel whose policies toward Palestinians in the occupied territories and its own citizens are increasingly beyond the pale and in contradiction of human rights, let alone American values. It remains unlikely, however, as Biden did no such thing publicly on his trip to Israel in July.  Levy also discussed where the Israeli left has gone, the role of Palestinian voters and parties, and what all this might mean for the policies of the emerging Israeli government. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.This is Netanyahu’s umpteenth time as prime minister. What’s going to be different this time?First, we just have to acknowledge that he’s returning to the premiership at a quite advanced stage of court cases proceeding, where he’s had to spend time in court [defending himself against corruption charges]. Those carry on. He’s not going to come in blundering on this, but it needs to be resolved. He has a coalition that will be a partner in resolving it. I don’t know exactly what the resolution of it looks like. It could be as simple as — not him, but one of the coalition allies — proposing immunity for the prime minister. Quite literally, his return to the prime minister’s office is his get-out-of-jail card. Whether it’s through legislation, or whether certain personnel are changed, and the file [against him] is revisited — it could be done where the police minister insists that has to be resolved. Number two, he is likely to have a more ideologically coherent and homogenous government than has been the case for most of his time as prime minister. The nature of his coalition alliance looks different.Netanyahu has tended to favor having bits of his coalition that he can dangle in front of some foreign audiences to say, “Look, you know, these guys are in my government with me.” Yair Lapid’s been there with him before, Benny Gantz has been there with him before, Labor have been there with him before. The line that “I want to do X” — X can be annexation [of occupied Palestinian territory], X can be other steps — “but I don’t have the coalition for it” no longer exists. What’s more, he has a powerful coalition ally to his right. They have two options. Either they manage to get something passed that hasn’t been passed before, whether it’s changing the status at the Temple Mount, which is very, very high risk; whether it’s laws that have not heretofore been applied in the occupied territories; whether it’s laws against Palestinian citizens of Israel that have not heretofore been applied; whether it’s rescinding of citizenship for people, which is something they’ve talked about, or things that are more directly hostile to Palestinians, perhaps annexation. That’s difficult because you can never sate the appetite, in terms of what should be annexed. So they need one of two things, either something they can say, “We’ve delivered,” or that they can turn around and say, “Bibi stopped us.”The other thing is that Netanyahu has a Likud party made much more in his own image, with very few heavyweight independent actors now, if any.What does this coalition look like? What is this more coherent government likely to look like?Israel has a very pure form of proportional representation where the entire country is one district of 120 seats. This is super relevant in this election. As long as you hit a 3.25 percent threshold of support, you get representation in parliament, which means the smallest number of seats a party can get in the 120-seat Knesset is four. Then you build from there. This is unusually small in terms of the number of parties that constitute this coalition. It will be composed of four party “lists.”The Likud party is the traditional party of the right. As the center of gravity of Israeli politics has continually shifted rightward, so too has the Likud party. Likud have no qualms this time around. In the past it was, “Well can we really have been Ben Gvir in the government?” They’ve paved the way for that. There’s no question. No one today is saying, “Well, you know, this party is so extreme.” No one’s questioning it. You have two parties representing the ultra-Orthodox Haredi public, who are the other big winners, by the way. They’ve scored a phenomenal success and increased their numbers. That does tend to happen when your community is having six, seven, eight, nine children per family and everyone else isn’t. So that demography is now manifesting itself in votes. So you have the two ultra-Orthodox factions: one representing the Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox community, the other representing the Sefardi ultra-Orthodox community. The fourth party is this amalgamation of hard-right, national-religious extremists, which is known as religious Zionism. This fourth one is the Jewish Strength Party. Tell me about that. Israel has been drifting to the right as long as I can remember. But this is pretty extreme, bigoted, Jewish supremacist, homophobic party that is normalizing the Kahanist worldview.This is now the third-largest party in the Israeli parliament. Just pause on that. The third largest party in the Israeli parliament is a party that derives its ideological inspiration from the most extreme strand. Now, the leader of one element of this party is Ben Gvir, who everyone in Israel considers to be the big winner of the election. He’s a lawyer who tends to represent Jewish murderers of Palestinians, who commit terror acts, not in uniform, as civilians. Just before [Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin’s assassination [at the hands of a Jewish extremist in 1995], he appeared in a famous TV clip with the emblem of Rabin’s car, and he said, “We got to his car, and we’ll get to him, too.” He will appear in Palestinian neighborhoods where settlers are trying to move in, brandishing a pistol, using his parliamentary immunity. He has faced 50 criminal charges, of which he has been convicted of 12, including racist incitement and support of a terrorist organization. He’s also been accused of destroying evidence of Israeli attacks against Palestinians, in his role as their lawyer.He has, for instance, proposed that Palestinian citizens of Israel and Jewish leftists be stripped of their citizenship. He is a serial inciter. He’s the one who would lead the marches where there are chants of “Death to the Arabs.” Last night, at the gathering was “Death to the Terrorists” with a smirk. They’d replaced the Arabs with terrorists, but that’s how they define terrorists, so it’s pretty much the same there. However, it’s important to not fall into the trap of just seeing this as an aberration. It might be an “upgrade” in extremism, but I think it’s correct to place this on a continuum of the absorption into Israeli politics of the most extreme. It’s really important to understand that when Rabbi Meir Kahane came over from America and came into the Knesset, there was a cordon sanitaire built around him — people would literally leave the plenary, Likudnicks would stand up and leave the plenum when he spoke, and then he got banned for being racist. That was almost four decades ago. Since then, the reverse has happened. Since then, you have seen that serial absorption into the Israeli body politic, into Israeli government coalitions.You have Avigdor Lieberman, who now people say, “Oh, he’s part of normal Israel.” No, Lieberman ran on a card of a loyalty test for citizenship, you had to be loyal to the Jewish state — as a Palestinian citizen of Israel, you had to say “I declare my loyalty not to Israel, but to the Jewish state of Israel.” He gets absorbed.Naftali Bennett, who is an annexationist, and Ayelet Shaket, who came out with the most horrific racist statements, they get absorbed. Each time extremism gets absorbed, and each time what happens is the center of gravity shifts further to the right. And we move on. Then the next one gets absorbed, center of gravity shifts further to the right — reset, move on.The permissive environment is the key here. The enabling environment has led to this party [Jewish Strength] getting 14 seats, as things currently stand, and Ben Gvir coming forward. It’s crucial to look at what was the record, for instance, of the [outgoing] Lapid-Bennett government, and how they have also paved the way to this happening. Lapid does things that I think Bibi would have felt, “Hm, can I get away with this?” in criminalizing Palestinian civil society groups, including a famous human rights organization Al-Haq and others. They issued new regulations, more harsh regulations, on who can study, work, live, love in the West Bank (if your partner is in the West Bank or Gaza). They’ve returned to a policy of extrajudicial assassinations. This is with Labor, with the Zionist left in the government. They do all these things. And of course, what they’re doing is paving the way for more and more extremism. Where’s the Israeli left? Is there an Israeli left?Let’s define our terms, because there is a left Arab party that will be the largest party on the left now, which is Hadash-Ta’al — the Communist Party and the party for renewal. This is a secular left Arab party. The Zionist left, if the current results hold, will be reduced to four seats, which is the remnant of the Labor Party, which is on the threshold of extinction, once you’re at four seats. Meretz seems to have dropped off altogether. They went into government with Bennett an avowed annexationist and hard-rightist a year ago. In that government, they did nothing to stand up for equality and human rights in practice. And unfortunately, they have earned their own certificate of extinction. We have to say another thing, because it would be remiss not to give an honorable mention to the other great enabler of this, which is the impunity accorded Israel day in, day out, year in, year out, no matter what it does, by way of violating international law, violating human rights, violating UN resolutions. Unfortunately, America takes pride of place in that.Before we talk about that, what about the Palestinian citizens of Israel? How have they been voting in this election?This has been one of the most interesting stories in this election. You had in the last government something unprecedented, which is a party of Palestinian citizens of Israel that was a full coalition member. That party was an Islamist party, a conservative party, and they basically said — and I’m paraphrasing here — “We don’t really believe in the system, but we want to get the best for our community, and we know we’re not going to win on the Palestinian issue. And let’s set them aside.” They actually said that. They managed to deliver very little for their community. Their inclusion in the government became a rallying cry for the other side. It’s one of the reasons I think extremists did so well in this election. The other party that didn’t go in [to the government], the Joint List, split. A faction called Balad broke away and ran a fascinating, independent campaign. No one was paying any attention to Balad.Everyone expected, by the way — because Palestinians rarely see the efficacy of their participation — another very low turnout. We don’t have the numbers yet, but it seems that turnout was quite high. The Palestinian citizens of Israel voted 13 seat’s worth of members of Knesset. Strange choice of language — why did I choose it? Because it seems that, according to the current statistics, both the party that was in the government, the United Arab List (Ra’am), and the remaining part of the Joint List will get five seats each, and this Balad party has three seats’ worth of votes. They won’t get in. There was an almost richly ironically comic moment during election night, when it seemed like the only way of preventing Netanyahu from forming a government was if Balad would cross the threshold. You had all these Israeli Jews who constantly pillory and spew bile against Balad praying for them to get into the Knesset. Why am I mentioning this? Balad ran the campaign of this election in the Arab sector, and they ran on a platform of, “We will not lend a hand or recommend either of these potential leaders, because neither of them stands against the occupation, neither of them believes in equality, neither of them will change the structural discrimination faced by our community.”They ran this really mobilizing campaign and did way better than anyone expected. Politics will become more interesting in that space in the coming period.Back to the question about the US. Netanyahu has this long rapport with Biden. What’s the outlook after this election for US-Israel relations?I do not think the Biden administration wants a fight. [That said,] Netanyahu has a history of playing partisan politics in America. There is still a very bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths in terms of how Bibi treated Obama as a person and the Obama administration. Of course, you now have a cohort of Democrats who have made clear that they’re not comfortable with the exceptionalism with which Israel is treated in US politics. Throw into the mix how extreme this government is likely to be — no cover from any party that calls itself centrist. Not only are the coalition allies overtly racist, they also are a pretty hard group to sell if you’re in the business of pink-washing, given that they are extremely homophobic and their response to Gay Pride marches was to hold “Beast Pride” marches. But let’s see what happens in the American midterms. Let’s see how much partisan politics Bibi plays.Sadly, I do not anticipate a real change and a recognition on the American side. By failing permanently to hold Israel accountable, America has played a key role in the permanent denial of Palestinian rights and the creation of a reality which, for significant reasons, the blue-chip human rights organizations have defined as one of an apartheid reality — Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, following in the wake of B’tselem and others inside Israel, and in the wake of Palestinian human rights groups.But I would say this, and it’s important: Biden visited Israel in a trip that also took him elsewhere in the region. It was an obsequious visit, but what it did is it put a heckuva lot of credit in the bank. It is very hard to now depict Biden, as you know, “Joseph Hussein Obiden,” who’s an anti-Israel guy. He comes with a far greater ability to do so. Let’s see if that is used and if he puts that to the test if he needs to, and I’m pretty damn sure he needs to. We should have done it with the Lapid government.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Israel’s protests over sweeping judicial reforms, explained",2023-07-23,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:Air Force pilots and Israel’s biggest trade union threatened strikes over the legislation.Hundreds of thousands of Israelis throughout the country are protesting the first of a series of proposed radical changes to the country’s judicial system, which they fear will weaken checks on the executive branch — consolidating power under right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies. Over the weekend tens of thousands of protesters marched from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a distance of 70 kilometers. Protests continued Monday. The demonstrators are calling for general strikes and set up a tent city outside Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, as part of months-long protests against the proposed changes. The changes would give the Knesset final say over judicial appointments and give it the power to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority.The first of the new laws passed on Monday after a round of debate on Sunday. That policy will overturn the doctrine which gives Israel’s Supreme Court oversight of the government’s cabinet and ministerial selections, as well as the power to rule on the “reasonableness” of a government decision or policy. Should all of the new laws go into effect, the courts — and Israeli society — will have little recourse to challenge government policy they understand to be illegal, wasteful, fraudulent, or undemocratic.All of this happens as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recovers from having a pacemaker installed — though his hospitalization hasn’t stopped him from pushing his legislation forward. President Isaac Herzog, who just wrapped up a trip to Washington, DC, has come out in support of a strong judiciary and has attempted to broker a compromise for the past several months as protests continued. Many sectors of Israeli society have come out against the legislation, most prominently elite Israeli Defense Force (IDF) reserve pilots and members of the Air Force. Israel’s largest trade union has also threatened a strike, and the Israel Medical Association has also indicated that it plans to strike should the legislation go through. Changes to the judicial system would drastically alter Israeli society on every conceivable level — likely pushing it in a more religious, hard-line direction under Netanyahu and his allies. Though proponents of the changes claim the intention is to put power in the hands of elected officials rather than unelected judges, it’s much more serious, protesters say; it’s about whether Israel will remain a democratic state or become a religious autocracy.The concept of the “reasonableness” doctrine is a peculiar one, but, advocates say, it’s critical to Israeli democracy and an important part of the court’s checks on the legislative and executive branches. There is a set of Basic Laws governing elections, the makeup of the Knesset, the role of the judiciary, and the military, among other subjects. At an undetermined future date, the Basic Laws will “constitute together, with an appropriate introduction and several general rulings, the constitution of the State of Israel,” according to the Knesset’s website.But Israel lacks a written constitution; therefore decisions that the state makes can’t be measured by constitutionality. Instead they’re measured by “reasonableness” — in a sense, a question about whether it’s reasonable to use state resources and power in the suggested way. “This is about whether the resources of the state will actually be used for the public interest,” Amichai Cohen, a legal expert at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem-based research group, told the New York Times. “Will the ministers interpret this elimination of reasonableness as carte blanche to just use the resources at their disposal, as they see fit, for political reasons?”The current measure that passed Monday includes only a provision to “completely block courts from evaluating the ‘reasonableness’ of administrative decisions made by the cabinet or its ministers,” according to the Times of Israel. The Knesset adjourns July 30 for a recess, but the next possible measures would include increased political oversight of judicial appointments as well as an extremely controversial measure to override Supreme Court invalidations of legislation via a simple majority, though Netanyahu has said he would not pursue that measure. Despite the mass movement against the judicial changes, they do have some support, particularly in the increasingly powerful religious, Zionist, and ultra-Orthodox Haredi community. The Haredi, whose social and religious codes encourage them to shun secular life, have formed a powerful bloc with Netanyahu’s Likud party, and have pushed for the court to extend the community’s exemption from Israel’s compulsory military service.The proposed judicial reforms would push Israeli politics far to the right. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, made up of ultra-nationalist and ultra-Orthodox politicians, has a slim majority in the Knesset — only four seats. But in context, that’s a pretty significant majority given the fact that there has not been such a majority in years. And that coalition desperately needs each other; Likud, Netanyahu’s party, needs the Religious Zionism, Jewish Power, and Haredi parties to stay in power, and they need Netanyahu to push through the policies, and especially the religious policies, that they want.“The ultra-Orthodox Jewish world is an opportunist. They’re going to be in a government who will give them what they want,” Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie, a co-founder of the progressive Jewish community Lab/Shul NYC and an Israeli-American, told Vox in an interview, though “the shift to the right in Haredi camp is fairly recent. The real issue is the religious Zionist camp.”It’s worth remembering, too, that Netanyahu is still on trial on charges of corruption and fraud. “It’s hard to distinguish between his desire to avoid jail and his desire to remain in power,” David Myers, a professor of Jewish history at UCLA, told Vox in an interview. In some ways, the current state goes back to 2009, the start of what Myers called the “Netanyahu decade.” “During that long decade, he already initiated a series of steps to strip away some of the features of liberal democracy in Israel, trying to restrict the activity of human and civil rights organizations, trying to restrict the speech of artists who receive government subsidies, trying to restrict educational curricula,” he said. Those actions, he said, escalated the movement toward illiberal democracy and majority rule as it’s being practiced in Israel today. But the question of whether Israel can be both religious and democratic goes back further, to its founding in 1948.The present protests are unprecedented in Israel’s modern history; “It’s brought out on to the streets people who never thought they would protest against the Jewish state,” Myers said, including members of the military. It has also brought out counterprotesters. Supporters of the new legislation turned out in a counterprotest in Tel Aviv Sunday, with right-wing Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich headlining the event. “Those against the reform, I understand how you’re feeling, this is how we felt during Oslo,” Smotrich said during his speech, referencing agreements between the state of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to move toward Palestinian self-determination. Smotrich is a member of the far-right Religious Zionist political party and a proponent of increased Jewish settlements in the Palestinian West Bank who recently claimed that there is “no such thing as a Palestinian people.”“On one level, Israel’s democracy crisis is about the occupation,” Myers said. Since its founding in 1948, Israel has forced Palestinian people out of their homes, out of citizenship, and out of public life; later, after the Six-Day, or 1967, War, Israel also began occupying the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem, causing a second Palestinian exodus. And under Netanyahu, the speed, scale, and destructive power of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and evictions of Palestinians there and in East Jerusalem has been dizzying. “We’re saying, defend democracy, save democracy — Israel has been a partial democracy for too long,” Lau-Lavie said, referring to the Israeli state’s policies regarding Palestine. “If you’re Jewish, there’s some semblance of democracy — you can have laws, you can have debates, you can do all sorts of things, there can be disagreements,” Diana Buttu, a Haifa-based analyst and former legal adviser to Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, told Vox in an interview. “But if you’re Palestinian, that is definitely not the case, and when the courts have been faced with the question, ‘Is Israel a democracy or is it a Jewish state,’ it’s always sided on the side of being a Jewish state.”While some Israeli protesters and American Jews are having acutely uncomfortable and challenging discussions about how deeply intertwined the occupation is with Israel’s identity, “the occupation is absent from conversation” Buttu said. “With the protests, what we’re seeing is that this is about the occupation — and yet the occupation is so absent from any of the discourse of these protests,” she said. “I have yet to see anyone carrying even a slogan, even a sign that makes the connection between what Israel is doing to Palestinians and this protest movement. It’s completely and totally absent.”Ahead of the vote, thousands of members of Israel’s military reserves, and in particular elite pilots, said they will not show up for duty in the Israeli Defense Force, or IDF, should the challenge to the reasonableness doctrine be approved by the Knesset. There will also likely be a general strike, as Israel’s biggest trade union has as of yet failed to reach a compromise with the government on the legislation. Philosophically, there’s also the existential consequence of the legislation; according to Lau-Lavie, if it passes, “That’s the end of Israel as we know it.” Update, Monday, July 24, 9:30 am: This piece, originally published on July 23, has been updated to reflect the passage of the first of a set of proposed judicial reforms.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"What’s going on with Israel’s massive protests, explained",2023-03-09,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Israelis are revolting against Netanyahu. But a judicial overhaul isn’t the country’s only crisis.Hundreds of thousands of Israeli protesters who have been demonstrating against the extreme-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since January have put a judicial overhaul plan on pause.On Sunday more than 600,000 protesters turned out in defiance of his ultranationalist, illiberal government. This builds on two months of mass mobilizations across Israel that have been squarely focused on the Netanyahu government’s set of judiciary overhauls, which would weaken the independence of the country’s high court and create the conditions for unchecked majoritarian rule. On Monday, Netanyahu agreed to delay the judicial overhaul proposal until the next parliamentary session. That will be after the upcoming Passover recess. Sunday’s impressive political mobilization — with a general strike and massive shutdowns across the country — came in response to Netanyahu’s firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday. Gallant had criticized the judicial overhaul. Demonstrators brought Israeli cities to a standstill. Airport departures, universities, and shopping centers halted in protest. Now the question is whether the delay will do anything to really change the judicial overhaul’s likelihood of passing — and whether Netanyahu’s coalition may hold in the meantime. “This is not just another right-wing government,” says Yehuda Shaul, an Israeli activist and co-director of the think tank Ofek: The Israeli Center for Public Affairs. The Israeli government is embarking on two revolutions at once, according to Shaul. “One is inside Israel: getting rid of any remains of checks and balances, independence of the judiciary, going full-blown illiberal democracy Orbán-style,” he told me, referring to Hungary’s prime minister. “Then there is the second revolution, which is the changes in the Israeli governance in the occupied territories, mainly in the West Bank. That is one word: annexation.” Largely absent from the protests’ calls has been attention toward the already abysmal situation for Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians living under occupation in the West Bank. But Netanyahu’s current government is unprecedented in this regard, too: Israeli settlers who advocate for Jewish supremacist policies now hold powerful ministerial roles and are making moves to annex the occupied West Bank. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich recently called for the eradication of a Palestinian village. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir is a longtime inciter of violence against Palestinians.The anti-government protests also come at a time of intensive violence between Israelis and Palestinians that could spiral to a new dangerous phase with these extremist Israeli ministers in top posts. Israeli authorities have been conducting deadly raids on West Bank cities and villages, including a military raid that killed six Palestinians earlier this month. It’s part of a crescendo of Israeli clampdown, as grassroots Palestinian groups and individuals turn to violent resistance and terrorism in response to the daily violence of the Israeli occupation.This moment is a crisis for Israel’s democracy — sparked by these proposals, but built from decades of right-wing policies promulgated by Netanyahu. The crisis is also inseparable from the erosion of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories. Netanyahu and his allies are pursuing a shock doctrine that amounts to crippling the Israeli governance system and a total reordering of the Israeli occupation. Even if one element of that shock doctrine is delayed, the government’s ideology remains unchanged.Netanyahu was elected to a sixth premiership this November, but this time with the most extreme, nationalistic, and exclusionary government in Israeli history. From the get-go, the Israeli government has sought to make significant changes to the high court that would hollow out its independence and its power to serve as a check on the Israeli parliament, or the Knesset. The several bills put forward would restrict the court’s ability to overturn laws it sees as unconstitutional and allow a simple majority in the Knesset to reject its decisions. It would also give government lawmakers and appointees effective power over the committee of nine individuals that appoints judges, and rescind key authorities from the attorney general. These and other changes would weaken the independent judiciary’s power in a parliamentary system that otherwise lacks checks. This is all complicated by the fact that Israel doesn’t have a constitution, but a set of regulations passed as the basic law. The proposal’s backers, like a group of Israeli academics who recently published an open letter in support, say the court has grown too powerful. But, according to a recent survey by the Israel Democracy Institute, “66 percent of Israelis think the Supreme Court should have the power to strike down a law if it is incompatible with the Basic Laws.”The result of the judicial overhaul would be a form of majoritarian rule, where minority groups — especially Palestinian citizens of Israel, who are about 20 percent of the country’s population — would face serious threats. “Minority rights will be protected by the majority’s benevolence. That contradicts a core element of democracy, of course,” writes Natan Sachs of the Brookings Institution.These proposals have sparked the massive protests in Israel — and outrage from unexpected quarters.Many former Israeli leaders have warned of fascism taking over the country, and now their voices are growing loud. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, one of the country’s most decorated military leaders, has been joining the demonstrations, along with former prime minister and opposition leader Yair Lapid and former Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni. “In Israel, nobody will be above the law, not even the prime minister,” Livni said in January. Ram Ben Barak, a member of the Knesset who formerly worked as deputy director of Israel’s Mossad intelligence services, made a comparison to Nazi Germany in a stark indication of how bad Israel’s opposition judges the situation to be. “Netanyahu, Ben-Gvir and all you other fellow travelers — check Wikipedia and read the history of how the Nazi party rose to power democratically and immediately became a dictatorship,” Ben Barak tweeted.  Pilots from elite Air Force reservist unit are on strike, and former Air Force chiefs have written a letter against the judicial actions. Israel’s national security leaders worry that Israel will be less able to defend itself in international forums; for example, for its potential war crimes in Gaza, the West Bank, and inside Israel if its judiciary is less credible and not independent. Investors, bankers, and financial leaders have expressed concern about how it would affect the economy. Israel’s influential tech sector staged a work stoppage in protest. Bestselling international writer Yuval Noah Harari, who is a professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, called the government’s moves an “antidemocratic coup.” But Netanyahu and his partners for months condemned the protesters and stood firm in their conviction. “The extreme and dangerous group that organizes [the protests] just wants to burn down the house and create chaos in the country,” Netanyahu said earlier this month.It should be noted that Netanyahu is on trial for alleged corruption — charges that he’s denied but that have plagued his political life in recent years. There’s been speculation that those allegations are why he’s been pursuing a major overhaul to the Israeli judiciary, with the effect of weakening its independence. But that’s only part of the story. There are three pillars of his governing coalition — Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party, ultranationalist settlers, and the ultra-Orthodox — and they each have something to gain from this massive judicial overhaul. “For the first time, they have a complete alignment of interests with no daylight in between, to destroy the judiciary and institutions, for different reasons,” Shaul told me. “And that’s what makes this moment so dangerous.”It would be beneficial for Netanyahu’s allies in his party for the courts to be disempowered as he tries to wriggle out of longstanding corruption allegations. For the ultranationalist settlers led by Ben Gvir and Smotrich, such judicial changes would open up the opportunity of annexation of the occupied West Bank and other policies that would benefit settlers. And for the ultra-Orthodox supporters, it would — perhaps through changing the makeup of key judiciary appointments — lessen the Supreme Court’s likelihood of ruling that exemptions to the military draft are unconstitutional, among other issues of church and state important to this constituency. Fractures in the coalition may emerge. Ben Gvir acceded to delaying the judicial overhaul vote on Monday, and apparently in return he will head up a new national guard.But it’s worth noting that while the judicial reforms might be the most incendiary and attention-grabbing of the coalition’s proposals at this moment, they’re in keeping with its broader goals.  The judiciary is only one component of this government’s attack on the rule of law.  Netanyahu’s government is also proposing radical changes to the way the occupation of the West Bank is administered and other legal shifts inside Israel that will severely affect Palestinians.There’s a ton to keep track of, and not all of it might be implemented, but taken together it represents a shock-doctrine-style approach to transforming the way Israel operates. One of the most significant changes would be the transfer of military authority over the occupied West Bank to the hands of civilian government. That would in effect constitute the de jure annexation of territory. The Biden administration opposes this, but if there is not a direct condemnation from the United States and Europe, and real consequences for Israel, experts fear that Netanyahu’s government will move forward.The government’s overt policy is of Jewish supremacy over all the land of Israel, broadly construed, and its nonbinding coalition guidelines seek to entrench “annexation without official declaration,” according to a policy paper by top Israeli human rights organizations.   Other changes include advancing legislation to give Ben Gvir, who is minister of national security, the authority to intervene in the priorities of investigations of the police. It could lead to further deprioritization of investigations into settler violence, which already receive relatively scant attention from Israeli authorities. Then there’s a new law that would revoke the citizenship of Palestinian citizens of Israel and their families should they be convicted of terrorist charges; there’s also the potential reinstatement of the death penalty for those convicted of “terrorist offenses.”The government has already approved the construction of more than 7,000 settlement units in the West Bank, almost twice the total approved last year. New policies would further legalize settler outposts. (State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US was “deeply troubled” by these settlement announcements, but has not outlined any consequences.)This is in addition to actions that human rights organizations view as collective punishment of Palestinians, like an uptick in Palestinian home demolitions. Every night raid, random checkpoint, and home demolition holds out the potential of further radicalization, as the Israeli occupation hits new levels of violence.The two revolutions being pursued by the new Israeli government have been enabled by the decay of rule of law inside Israel as a result of the occupation of Palestinian territory that started in 1967. The parallel legal systems, which Palestinian and Israeli experts call apartheid, have created the conditions whereby it’s easier for a radical right-wing government to chip away at checks and balances. Indeed, researcher Yousef Munayyer notes, “The government’s assault on the judiciary is driven by the same urge as the state’s founders: to protect their power to privilege Jews over Palestinians.” The slippery slope poses a threat to the very tenets of Israeli democracy. The designation of seven Palestinian NGOs that focus on human rights as “terrorist groups” in 2021 may create conditions for the further crackdown on Israeli civil society. If a Palestinian citizen of Israel’s citizenship can be revoked, as a new law enshrines, it could lead to laws that institute the same for Jewish citizens of Israel.One of the most frightening outcomes could be what Shaul calls “the nuclear option,” whereby Palestinian political parties could be barred from participating in Israeli elections. The Central Elections Committee, for example, has disqualified parties like Balad from participating in Knesset elections, only to then have the Supreme Court override this. But what if there was no override? Balad would not be able to run, and other Palestinian parties in Israel would likely be prohibited, too, or choose not to participate. “Then you basically have elections where Palestinian citizens of Israel cannot run or boycott,” Shaul told me. “Game over, so to speak.” Yet only some protesters have apparently made this connection. As journalist Peter Beinart wrote recently in the New York Times, “a movement premised on ethnocracy cannot successfully defend the rule of law.”Earlier this month, Netanyahu’s colleagues were reportedly engaged in secret talks with legal experts toward a compromise on the judicial proposals. Now, the vote will be delayed until next month or later. It’s unclear what that means for protests in the interim. Even if Israel’s domestic crisis subsides, the violence of the Israeli occupation continues, and the resistance of Palestinians has led CIA Director Bill Burns to warn of a third intifada or uprising. A February statement put out by Israel, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the United States, Jordan, and Egypt sought to calm tensions, but that very day saw a Palestinian gunman shooting two brothers in the West Bank and a settler rampage against the Palestinian village of Huwara. The diplomatic effort showed how wide the gap is between leadership of these countries and the ever-worsening reality on the ground.On Sunday, White House spokesperson Adrienne Watson expressed concern and said that “fundamental changes to a democratic system should be pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support.”But that’s not enough to address the deeper crises at play. The Biden administration will need to do more than just call for a two-state solution. It will need to do more than offer subtle rebukes while hugging Israel closer with joint statements professing its concern for Israel’s security. It will need to grapple with the two revolutions underway in Israel. One thing is clear: Focusing on the judicial aspect and not on the radical changes to the occupation of Palestinians is not just a bad strategic choice. It will also weaken security and stability for all.  Update, March 27, 12:50 pm: This story was originally published on March 9 and has been updated with Netanyahu’s firing of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, ongoing protests, and the delayed vote on the judicial reform.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Why did Hamas invade Israel?,2023-10-07,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:The assault on southern Israel exposed the reality of the Palestinian conflict.What’s happening right now in Israel almost defies imagination. Overnight, Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented invasion across Israel’s southern border with Gaza, storming Israeli towns and killing Israeli soldiers and civilians alike. Thousands of rockets were fired into Israeli territory, and at least 100 Israelis are dead — a senior Knesset official said the attacks led to the most civilian deaths on a single day in the country’s entire history. The fighting in southern Israel is ongoing, with reports that Hamas is bringing Israeli hostages back to Gaza. Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes have already killed nearly 200 Palestinians, a figure that will likely only grow, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that “our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known.”[Related: Hamas has launched an unprecedented strike on Israel. Here’s what you need to know.]Nothing like this has happened in the modern history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; even the bloody Second Intifada in the early 2000s never saw this kind of mass incursion into Israeli territory. Now an outright war between Israel and Hamas has begun, one whose consequences for the conflict and the broader Middle East we can only dimly anticipate. The only thing we can be certain about the future is that many, many people are about to die.How can we begin to think about such a nightmare? Tell us by filling out this form. We’ll try to answer your questions in an upcoming story.We can start by examining the conditions that made it possible. Though we can’t be sure why Hamas chose to launch this attack now, we do know that there are a number of background conditions — including not just the ongoing occupation but also recent surges of conflict in Jerusalem and the West Bank, a far-right Israeli government, and Israeli-Saudi negotiations about normalizing relations — that made the situation especially combustible.And this leads to a second, more fundamental point: The conflict is not, as some have suggested, “stable” — and likely never can be made so.So long as Israel rules over the Palestinian population, violence will be ongoing and escalation inevitable. The only real way to prevent this kind of thing from happening is for the two sides to come to a mutually agreeable solution that addresses the root causes of violence.Except today, any solution seems further away than ever.In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip — a policy called “disengagement” that was designed, in theory, to remove Israel from direct management of the Palestinian-populated territory. But in 2007, following tensions with the official Palestinian leadership, the militant faction Hamas took control of the strip by force. Since then, things have been worse for Israelis and (especially) Palestinians.Israel imposed a strict blockade on Gaza, tightly restricting the flow of goods and people in and out of the territory, entrenching the military occupation. Hamas tunneled under the border wall to launch cross-border raids and fired rockets into Israeli territory. Israel would periodically hit Gaza with airstrikes, often targeting operatives from Hamas and other militant groups — but inevitably hitting civilians in the crowded Gaza Strip. The perennially tense situation escalated to outright war at least four times since disengagement prior to the current conflict. These previous conflicts were horrific for civilians (and, again, especially Palestinians), but never saw any kind of fighting on the scale of today on Israeli soil.[Related: Benjamin Netanyahu failed Israel]As combustible as this setup has been, Israeli leadership saw it as essentially the best arrangement available to them. They believed that they could reduce rocket fire to an acceptable level, relying on the Iron Dome missile defense system. Israeli troops and border security measures could prevent major cross-border raids.Targeted killings and shows of force could deter Hamas itself from escalating too much, as they’d always bear the brunt of the suffering in a true war. These periodic strikes have been euphemistically termed “mowing the grass,” a reference to the idea that the terrorist threat couldn’t be eliminated but could be reduced to a tolerable level.Today’s events showed that these assumptions were badly mistaken.Hamas was not deterred from attacking Israel, nor was it stopped by border security. It penetrated Israeli territory through land, sea, and air; once its forces entered, they rampaged through southern Israel. The streets of Sderot, a border town, are currently a war zone.Why did everything go so horribly wrong? It’s too early to provide any definitive answers, but there are a few important factors to consider.According to Hamas, the attack was provoked by recent events surrounding the Temple Mount, a site in Jerusalem holy to Jews and Muslims alike. In the past week, Israeli settlers have been entering the al-Aqsa Mosque atop the mount and praying, which Hamas termed “desecration” in a statement on their offensive (which they’ve named Operation Al-Aqsa Storm).It’s implausible, to put it mildly, that Hamas was simply outraged by these events and is acting accordingly. This kind of complex operation had to be months in the making; the fact that it began one day after the 50-year anniversary of the Yom Kippur war, a surprise Arab invasion of Israel, is almost certainly not a coincidence.But at the same time, Hamas’s choice of casus belli does tell us something important.Palestinian politics is defined, in large part, by how its leadership responds to Israel’s continued occupation — both its physical presence in the West Bank and its economically devastating blockade of the Gaza Strip. Hamas’s strategy to outcompete its rivals, including the Fatah faction currently in charge of the West Bank, is to channel Palestinian rage at their suffering: to be the authentic voice of resistance to Israel and the occupation. The angrier Palestinians are at Israel, the greater Hamas’s political incentives for violence.And the past few months have seen plenty of outrages, ones even more significant than events in Jerusalem. Israel’s current hard-right government, dominated by factions that oppose a peace agreement with the Palestinians, has been conducting a de facto annexation of the West Bank. It has turned a blind eye to settler violence against West Bank civilians, including a February rampage in the town of Huwara. Israel’s focus on the West Bank may also have created an operational opportunity for Hamas. According to Uzi Ben Yitzhak, a retired Israeli general, the Israeli government has deployed most of the regular IDF forces to the West Bank to manage the situation there, leaving only a skeleton force at the Gaza border. The effort to secure permanent Israeli control over the West Bank, in this assessment, created conditions where a Hamas surprise attack could actually succeed.There are also geopolitical concerns at work. Israel is currently in the midst of a US-brokered negotiation to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, a major follow-up to the Abraham Accord agreements struck with several Arab countries during the Trump administration. Normalization is widely seen among Palestinians as the Arab world giving up on them, agreeing to treat Israel like a normal country even as the occupation deepens.Hamas could well be trying to torpedo the Saudi deal and even trying to undo the existing Abraham Accords. Indeed, a Hamas spokesperson said that the attack was “a message” to Arab countries, calling on them to cut ties with Israel.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]Rising tension in Jerusalem and the West Bank, weaker border security, an Arab political situation turning more and more unfavorable to the Palestinians — these are all conditions in which it makes more strategic sense for Hamas to take a such a huge risk.To be clear: Saying it makes strategic sense for Hamas to engage in atrocities is not to justify their killing civilians. There is a difference between explanation and justification: The reasoning behind Hamas’s attack may be explicable even as it is morally indefensible.We’ll find out more in the coming weeks and months about which, if any, of these conditions proved decisive in Hamas’s calculus. But they’re the necessary background context to even try to begin making sense of today’s horrific events.It is impossible to say, at this point, where this situation is heading. Fighting in southern Israel is ongoing; the Israeli counteroffensive in Gaza has yet to truly get underway. It’s possible that the fighting pulls in other forces, like Hezbollah in Lebanon; there’s some speculation that they were involved in the attack. This can, and almost certainly will, get much worse.But what’s clear at this point is that the situation cannot ever be truly stable. The very nature of the current situation, in which Israel rules over the Palestinian population, creates powerful incentives for radical groups like Hamas to engage in brutal acts of terrorism. Both Hamas and Israel’s current government are ideologically inclined toward violence rather than peace, conflict rather than cooperation. Without some kind of radical political change, there’s no real solution on the horizon.Meanwhile, it’s clear who is suffering the greatest consequences: not the extremist leaders on either side, but ordinary Israelis and Palestinians alike.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The State Department’s collapse, as explained by Rex Tillerson",2018-04-19,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:The New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow interviewed the former secretary of state. The results were revealing.The fact that Trump’s State Department is in shambles is not, at this point, debatable.Recent data from the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), the professional organization for America’s diplomatic corps, found that 60 percent of State’s highest-ranking career officers quit during Trump’s first year; the number of applications to join the foreign service dropped by half. Fewer than half of all top-level positions, political appointees nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, have been filled.The question that remains is who’s to blame. A new article by journalist Ronan Farrow, published in the New Yorker on Thursday morning, sheds light on the question. The piece is deeply reported, featuring a wide-ranging interview with Tillerson conducted while he was in office. Farrow paints a damning picture of a dysfunctional State Department, brought to the brink of ruin by Trump and Tillerson in equal parts.Trump’s management style emerges in the piece as a clear reason for State’s decline. The president’s top advisers are constantly at war with one another, struggling over influence in a pale imitation of Game of Thrones.In the months prior to Tillerson’s ouster, there were constant rumors that he was on the verge of being ousted. Jared Kushner, who had been put in charge of Israel-Palestine negotiations, was allegedly the one spreading those rumors in a bid to expand his own influence over foreign policy. Farrow describes an intense moment during their interview in which Tillerson reveals the depth of his anger toward the person responsible for spreading those rumors about him:Tillerson leaned in and, for a moment, I realized that it must be unpleasant to be fired by him. “I know who it is [behind the rumor]. I know who it is. And they know I know.”According to multiple individuals who had heard Tillerson speak of the matter behind closed doors, this was a reference to Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. Before Tillerson’s departure, tensions between the two men had been flaring regularly, often in the form of a public-relations proxy war. The fact that there was this level of hostility and tension between Kushner and Tillerson helps explain in why Tillerson — and by extension the State Department — struggled to be a prominent player in top-level foreign policy decisions.A second problem is the White House’s utter disinterest in — or perhaps even disdain for — the work that State Department diplomats and even lower-level officials do in running the day-to-day management of US foreign policy. The president, according to Tillerson, put little effort into filling vacant jobs at the State Department, including vital posts like ambassadors to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea. Tillerson complained to Farrow that he would propose names and never hear back from the White House about whether they could be formally nominated:“They’ve not been easy,” [Tillerson] recalled, of his year of conversations with the Trump Administration about filling the open jobs. “The process over there has not been the most efficient, and they’ve changed personnel trying to improve it, I mean, many, many times.  . . . It was very slow, it was very cumbersome, it was frustrating, at times, because you couldn’t get a sense of ‘What’s the issue?’ Someone seems to be kind of sitting in idle over there,” he said, sighing. “I would tell ’em, ‘Just give me a no. At least with a no, I’ll go get another name.’”If the president doesn’t care about getting high-level appointees like ambassadors through Congress and into their jobs, then the State Department won’t function.The third, and perhaps most important, reason for State’s collapse is that Secretary Tillerson was simply not well suited for his job. Before becoming secretary of state, Tillerson had spent years sitting at the very top of a massive multinational corporation, Exxon-Mobil. Tillerson was top dog — his office was even referred to as the “God Pod” by Exxon-Mobil employees. He was a powerful Texas oil executive who probably didn’t have his word questioned very often.  But when he became secretary of state, he suddenly had to defer to the whims of the president — a man he reportedly once described in a meeting with staffers as “a fucking moron” and who also likes to see himself as the toughest guy in the room. As Farrow explains, that dynamic didn’t exactly go so well:“The only person that I have to worry about is the President of the United States,” Tillerson told me. But that relationship was, likewise, fraught. Tillerson’s Texas swagger, the source close to the White House said, irked Trump. “You just can’t be an arrogant alpha male all the time with Trump. You have to do what [Secretary of Defense Jim] Mattis does, which is, ‘Mr. President, you’re the President, you’re smarter than me, you won, your instincts are always right, but let me just give you the other view, sir.’ Then you have this guy coming in,” the source said, referring to Tillerson, “going ‘Well, I guess because I worked for so many years in the oil business, I have something to say. You don’t know much about the region, so let me start with that.’ I mean, honestly, condescending.”CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Trump’s pick to replace Tillerson as secretary of state, reportedly has a much better relationship with the president. If he’s confirmed, he’ll have to keep it that way  — or else the deep damage done to America’s diplomatic corps during the Tillerson era won’t be healed.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"""Rediscovering my Judaism in the Trump era""",2017-04-06,Vox,['Britni de la Cretaz'],"Filed under:“Our faith has a long history of resistance.”I held my toddler’s hand as I walked her into a synagogue for the very first time, her father and infant sister following behind us. With every concrete step almost as tall as her little legs, climbing each one felt like a monumental accomplishment for her, even with my help. We entered the narrow room full of Rachels and Sarahs, were introduced to Eli and Abraham, and found an empty carpet square to sit on, claiming our place in the circle. With my daughters in my lap and my husband to my left, the familiar words began, and the songs and prayers of my childhood filled the room. “Shabbat shalom, hey!” sang the room in chorus. I watched my daughter look around in wonder. My usually shy child didn’t look nervous, the way I’ve come to expect she will in new situations. She soaked it all in, a smile spreading across her face. The rabbi handed my toddler a wooden replica of a Shabbat candlestick, and she clutched it in her small fingers. At the end of the song, she declined to give it back, holding it to her chest like it belonged to her. “Can we light the candles?” she asked me. I assured her we would.Until recently, I had considered myself a non-practicing Jew, a reformed atheist who found my way back to some sort of spirituality and began to embrace the cultural history of Judaism that I was raised with. Growing up in a predominantly white, majority Jewish town in South Florida meant I lacked much of the social context of what it meant to be Jewish in the world. I thought the Holocaust was in the distant past, something that had no relevance to the present day. I had never experienced discrimination or prejudice because of my religion.I learned the stories from the Torah but not the real meaning behind them. As far as I was concerned, they were just that: stories. Stories in the way Harry Potter is a story. Stories about splitting the sea, about flooding and arcs, about enslavement in ancient Egypt. Stories that did nothing to help me understand the world or my place in it. And so I turned away from the faith I was raised with.But then I had children, and suddenly it seemed incredibly important to make sure Judaism was present in our home. I felt an urge to ensure that we — and they — were connected to our culture, to understand where our family came from. My husband’s history with Judaism was much like mine, but we hung mezuzahs on our door frames, displayed menorahs decoratively. I started asking my grandparents questions about our history, the stories of how their families emigrated from Russia at the turn of the 20th century.My grandmother took a bunch of photo albums and boxes down from a closet and told me about how her mother’s family name was shortened — Americanized — after they passed through Ellis Island. I sifted through the photos, examining each one and listening to the stories my grandmother remembered about the people staring back at me in shades of black and gray, chins and noses pronounced, hair dark.These pictures of people that I had never met, would never meet, became some of my most prized possessions. I collected them like valuable jewels, finding them the perfect frames and arranging them in a gallery wall in the stairway of my home, reminders of where and who I came from. We settled down in a neighborhood of Boston where my grandfather had grown up, one that used to be predominantly Jewish but whose demographics had changed during white flight to the suburbs two generations ago. The giant churches we’d drive by every day still bore remnants of that history — Hebrew letters carved into the stone above the entryways.We began shopping around for synagogues when I was pregnant with my oldest child, but never committed to attending a service. It was something we wanted to do but not something we wanted to do enough to follow through with it. We attended a Passover seder at a friend’s house, lit Hanukkah candles at our own. But still, I felt a disconnect from my faith. I was just going through the motions for the sake of my children. At this rate, Judaism would mean as little to them as it did to me.But then a news alert came across the screen of my phone, three days before Donald Trump’s inauguration. The Jewish community center a few miles from my home had been evacuated following a bomb threat. I felt my palms begin to sweat as I stared at the notification in disbelief, jaw slightly slack. The room became very small as I focused on the little screen on the table in front of me; it was almost like my vision had become tunneled and unable to look anywhere else. I was sitting in the dining room of my home, the room with neon chartreuse walls, but everything looked black.Not here. Not now.My mind traveled back to the JCC near my childhood home. The sprawling compound, the basketball courts, the pool, the community room where dance classes were held. I hadn’t stepped foot into a temple since my bat mitzvah almost two decades before, and had spent the years since only tangentially connected to my Jewishness, but suddenly it was the only thing that mattered. Anti-Semitism, which until this time in my life had been only a theory, instantly became incredibly real. Even here, in the liberal bubble of Massachusetts, hatred is alive and well.Suddenly, the relative safety and privilege that I grew up with as a white American Jew has cracked wide open, revealing the rotten underbelly that’s always been here, the one I have chosen not to see. Anti-Semitic hate crimes are at their highest levels in years. JCCs around the country are getting bomb threats at an alarming rate. Steve Bannon, an anti-Semite, is in the White House. Swastikas appear like hideous confetti on walls and buildings all over the country. Jewish cemeteries have been vandalized. This hatred is not new; it has been here all along. But its brashness is something new. It is meaner, darker, more ominous. It is more urgent. It is knocking on my door, begging to come in.And while President Trump may have reminded us about his Jewish family members, and assured us at a recent press conference that we’re “going to see a lot of love” under his administration, so far, I don’t see it. And using his family to prove he isn’t anti-Semitic is about as effective as someone using a black friend to prove they’re not racist. It’s empty, hollow, a silencing tactic. Of course, there are other communities that have much more to be afraid of under Trump’s reign, marginalized people whose fears are more urgent and are already playing out in devastating ways via Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, deportations, and imminent threats of violence. People of color in America who have been afraid their entire lives, for whom this kind of fear is not new. A fear that my grandparents and their parents felt, that my own children may too. A fear that has turned walking into synagogue with my family into an act of bravery.Now more than ever, I want to teach my children what it means to be Jewish. Our faith has a long history of resistance: No matter how many times history has tried to erase us, to wipe us out, we have survived. We have resisted our own demise, and we have fought for the rights of others. Our people were active in the civil rights movement and fighting alongside black folks in the 1950s and ’60s. Today, my family has Black Lives Matter signs in our home and on our shirts. Before my oldest daughter could even walk, she marched with me as a Jew for the liberation of Palestine, strapped to my chest in a sling.We come from the oppressed, and mostly we have become privileged through the assimilation of many Jews into whiteness. But with assimilation and privilege can come complacency, which is something many white Jews like me and the people I grew up with can fall into all too easily. It is through complacency that we forget even the recent past, the Holocaust of only two generations ago. It is through complacency that we can become perpetrators of the oppression we were once victims of via a vote for Trump or a belief in marginalized people’s ability to “bootstrap” their way to success.Our family name is not Jewish; it would be easy for us to hide, to go unnoticed. Instead, we will teach our children to do what our people have done for thousands of years. When times get dark, we step into the light. As our country becomes a scarier place to be Jewish, our act of resistance is to embrace our faith and our culture with both arms. It is through turning toward, instead of turning away, that we connect to our roots as oppressed people. And it is this Judaism, the one that centers the fight for justice, that I connect to; it is the one that finally makes sense. Instead of turning away from our community, we are choosing to become part of it for the first time in our adult lives.As the group in the synagogue headed downstairs for the dinner portion of the Shabbat evening, my timid child had darted out of the room ahead of us to follow the group, never looking back to see if we were there. “Come on, Mom and Dad!” she shrieked, her excitement bouncing off the walls, carrying down the hallway. “This way!” Her small feet, in their gray boots with the pompoms on the sides, pitter-pattered in a half-run, half-walk toward the stairs. I scooped up her sister and raced after her.We were home. I knew it in my gut, and so, apparently, did my little girl. When we returned a second time because my daughter had been asking to go “back to Shabbat,” I became overwhelmed with emotion, choking on the words of the HaMotzi in a room full of people who also knew the words. “We give thanks to God for bread / Our voices rise in song together / As our joyful prayer is said.”My kids are still too young to understand what this means, but they will. We will be registering my daughter for Hebrew school in a few months, when she’s old enough to attend. We have chosen to join the congregation, paid our membership dues. My girls will know what it means to turn to a community of people who share their identity, an identity that has historically been persecuted and marginalized, and to find safety and belonging within it. They will know that when times get hard, we can turn to each other and make it through.Our existence is resistance in and of itself, but it’s time to do more. Today I teach my children to assert our faith and become part of a Jewish community when once again the world tells us that we don’t deserve to exist. But we do deserve to exist, and we will fight for that right, just like we always have.Britni de la Cretaz is a freelance writer, recovered alcoholic, and baseball enthusiast living in Boston.

Do we really need influencers’ Israel-Palestine hot takes?,2021-06-01,Vox,['Rebecca Jennings'],"Filed under:The demand that people with a platform “speak out” on every issue feels misdirected. A couple of days ago, I saw a TikTok that began as a callout toward creators who were too busy posting goofy videos to speak out on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Then, abruptly, the video stopped, cutting to another user. “You guys want @Spencewuah?” the second user asked, referring to an example of the type of popular creator the original video was calling out. “What is he gonna say of any fucking substance about the most pressing current event going on right now? If people want to educate themselves they should go to real fucking sources anyway,” she said. “Do you guys even care about the issue or do you care about influencers caring about the issue?”Each week we’ll send you the very best from the Vox Culture team, plus a special internet culture edition by Rebecca Jennings on Wednesdays. Sign up here.It reminded me of a discussion that I’d been seeing a lot on TikTok about the way social media has given us the expectation that every video, every tweet, every take needs to be a 100 percent irreproachable statement and encompass the lived experiences of everyone who might read it. “The way this app makes us act like teenagers need to have PhD-level expertise on every single topic is crazy,” was the gist of one TikTok I saw months ago and haven’t been able to stop thinking about. The same is true, evidently, for influencers. Beyond constant calls in comments sections from their followers to speak up on political issues, even other celebrities have joined the chorus. Earlier this month, the rapper Noname called out famous people who’d stayed silent on the latest phase of the conflict.It’s a natural inclination to demand action from the most privileged. The problem is that this desire for others to say something — anything! — feels misdirected. One anonymous beauty influencer told the UK fashion magazine Grazia that she’d received DMs from followers telling her they were “disappointed” that she hadn’t spoken up to advocate for Palestinians. She’d read the news but said that to share exactly what she was reading might be considered patronizing to her audience — or worse, end up spreading misinformation. As a woman of color, she also remembered her frustration last summer when non-Black creators kept chiming in about Black Lives Matter. “I didn’t want to be one of those people in this instance,” she said. After enough pressure, however, she shared a link to a news article. That still didn’t satisfy her followers. They told her that “the media wasn’t to be trusted” and sent her other resources instead. Would there have been a “right way” for a celebrity or influencer who is otherwise unconnected to the Israel-Palestine crisis to “speak out”? I’m not entirely sure. As Habiba Katsha writes in the Independent, “Forcing a group of people who haven’t expressed an interest in social issues to post political content can encourage performative allyship. If influencers are only posting political content because they’ve been told to, it means they’re posting out of obligation rather than desire, which is performative.” She contrasts this to, say, Bella and Gigi Hadid, who as half-Palestinian women have been able to draw on their personal experiences to be vocal about current events. (After they attended a pro-Palestine rally in New York, the Israeli government condemned their actions as anti-Semitic.) Israeli actress Gal Gadot also drew backlash for her tweets in support of her home country. Many celebrities who have made statements have faced immediate backlash. For weeks, Mark Ruffalo had made clear that his pro-Palestine remarks had nothing to do with anti-Semitism, but after extended pressure, he walked back his original criticisms of Israel. Rihanna, meanwhile, was accused of “All Lives Mattering” the issue when she wrote on Instagram that her “heart was breaking with the violence I’m seeing displayed between Israel and Palestine.”The number of people who believe celebrities should “stay out of politics” and the number of those who believe that they should speak up on every platform available is about even, at 29 percent and 28 percent, respectively, according to a 2018 poll from Morning Consult and the Hollywood Reporter. Gen Z and millennials are more likely to say that a celebrity speaking out would influence how they vote in an election. Yet the value of these statements should be considered as much as whether the statements should exist at all. For the most part, influencers exist because we like looking at them, their lives, their homes, and their clothes, and not necessarily their ability to articulate nuanced debates. Just as we should be suspicious of any big business that weighs in on political issues, so too should we be of celebrities, because ultimately both are beholden to their own economic success.Rather than share empty infographics on Instagram or make grandiose statements with little action to back them up, a better way the wealthy could use their platforms is by sharing what, exactly, they’re doing in support of their causes. Reminders from influencers that they engage in activism, that they give a certain percentage of their income to charitable causes, that they volunteer and support their local mutual aid groups, can normalize these activities to the point where more people feel as though we should be regularly incorporating them into our lives. But I don’t know that the demand for influencers to speak out on complex political issues is entirely about the issues themselves. It feels more like a test: Am I, as a fan, justified in having this parasocial relationship with you? Who are you, anyway? Should I be uncomfortable with how much attention we’re all giving you? I can’t help but feel the inevitable anger is similar to what happens when a certain type of always-mad-online person reads a news article about a celebrity wedding or a new fashion trend or, I don’t know, TikTok influencers. They’ll unleash their frustrations over the fact that too much media attention is spent on frivolous-seeming topics and lash out at the writer (“Why don’t you cover something actually important for once?” is a reply every culture reporter repeatedly gets on Twitter). It’s the same kind of misdirection — there are clearly thousands of other reporters covering the topics that said reader has deemed “actually important,” reporters who are far more knowledgeable and well-sourced on such things. Do you really want to read a heady explainer on a new health care bill written by me? Of course you don’t! Celebrities, in other words, should not be the moral compasses of the masses. We have other people who are supposed to be doing that — for example, political and spiritual leaders who are beholden to us as citizens rather than as consumers. To the extent that those people aren’t doing their jobs is a problem with a solution: Demand better from them, instead of unloading in a beauty influencer’s comment section.

How Natalie Portman became the latest Israel-Palestine flashpoint,2018-04-23,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:She turned down Israel’s Nobel Prize — and kicked off a major firestorm.Natalie Portman, one of the most famous Jewish celebrities on the planet, just announced she was boycotting a major Israeli event.Portman was scheduled to travel to Jerusalem to receive the Genesis Prize, a prominent award sometimes referred to as the “Jewish Nobel.” On Friday, she abruptly canceled her visit, writing that she “did not want to appear as endorsing [Israeli Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu” in an Instagram post explaining her decision. It’s not yet clear what’s happening to the $2 million in prize money that comes with the award.Celebrities deciding to avoid Israel on political grounds is not all that uncommon. Hollywood is left-leaning, and many celebrities are outspokenly pro-Palestinian. Netanyahu’s government is one of the furthest right in Israeli history, particularly when it comes to the conflict with the Palestinians. Tensions are to be expected.But Portman is an altogether different case. She is an Israeli citizen, born in Jerusalem, though she was raised in America and currently lives in France. In the past, Portman has been an outspoken advocate of Israel — as an undergraduate at Harvard, she worked on a prominent book defending the Jewish state against its critics. She speaks fluent Hebrew; in 2015, she wrote, directed, and starred in a Hebrew-language adaptation of Israeli author Amos Oz’s memoir.So Natalie Portman turning down a visit to Israel in protest is not business as usual, and Israeli politicians are not treating it as such. Oren Hazan, a member of Israel’s parliament from Netanyahu’s Likud Party, called for Portman’s Israeli citizenship to be stripped. A member of the cabinet, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, said her decision “has elements of anti-Semitism.”This is not a marginal controversy, some kind of celebrity sideshow. It is a leading indicator of the rising tensions between liberal American Jewry and the increasingly right-wing Israeli government. Portman is the canary in the coal mine, warning Israel that its policies on the Palestinians and African migrants are putting it increasingly at odds with its most natural friends abroad. The reason for Portman’s decision is more nuanced than it appeared at first blush.The Genesis Prize, in its own statement, said “recent events in Israel have been extremely distressing to her,” adding that “she does not feel comfortable participating in any public events in Israel.” This was widely interpreted as a reference to the crisis on the boundary between Israel and the Palestinian-populated Gaza Strip, in which Israeli troops have shot a number of Palestinians during occasionally violent demonstrations near a border fence. If Portman were boycotting Israel entirely over Gaza, it would be a stunning development. It would suggest that she, one of a relatively few celebrities to have prominently defended Israel in the past, was supporting the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. She would have, in effect, been signing up to serve as a prominent advocate for the international Palestinian cause. But Portman’s Instagram statement, which came after the Genesis Prize comment, gives a somewhat more subtle explanation. First, she explicitly denied that she was a BDS advocate; she was only skipping this event because Netanyahu was also scheduled to speak at it. “Like many Israelis and Jews around the world, I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation,” she writes.Second, her statement of grievance with Netanyahu’s government seemed to be at least in part about refugee policy. There are currently about 40,000 undocumented migrants, mostly African asylum seekers, in Israel. Netanyahu’s government backed off initial plans to deport them, but in early April reneged on an agreement with the United Nations that would give them permanent status in Israel, leaving the refugees in limbo. Portman’s statement seemed to imply that this was the “recent event” that had so upset her.“Israel was created exactly 70 years ago as a haven for refugees from the Holocaust,” she writes. “But the mistreatment of those suffering from today’s atrocities is simply not in line with my Jewish values.”However, focusing on the past month or so of Israeli political developments somewhat misses the point. Portman has long been a critic of Netanyahu’s government; after his 2015 reelection, she told the Hollywood Reporter that she was “very, very upset and disappointed,” blasting him for “racist” comments about Arab voters during the campaign.Indeed, her statement contained a largely overlooked line — “because I care about Israel, I must stand up against violence, corruption, inequality, and abuse of power” — suggesting that this is about more than just current events, but rather broader concerns Portman has with the Netanyahu government. This is less about a boycott of the Israeli state writ large, and more an American Jew and Israeli citizen expressing her concern with the state’s current leadership.That, however, is still a big deal. Very few Jews, Israeli or diaspora, support a wholesale boycott of Israel. But views on Netanyahu’s government, specifically, are far more mixed. The fact that Portman is framing her criticism as coming from a place of affection for the Jewish state, not hostility, makes it more likely that other Jews — especially Americans — will take it seriously. “This is an important symbolic moment,” says Jeremy Pressman, a scholar of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the University of Connecticut. “She cannot just be written off as a BDS supporter.”If this were just one person taking a one-time stand, it wouldn’t be all that noteworthy. But Portman’s stand against the Netanyahu government points to much broader and deeper divides emerging between Israel and American Jews.On one level, the divide between Israeli and American Jews couldn’t be simpler: Israeli Jews are, on the whole, more conservative than their American peers. Forty-nine percent of American Jews identify as liberal, per Pew data; only 8 percent of Israeli Jews say the same. Nearly twice as many Israeli Jews (37 percent) as American Jews (19 percent) described themselves as politically conservative in Pew’s survey.This owes to profoundly different historical experiences. American Jewish identity comes from “a sense of exclusion from American society,” Steven M. Cohen, a research professor at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, told me. Israel has a long and robust socialist political tradition but has tilted sharply rightward after the 1990s peace process collapsed into the violence of the Second Intifada and a 2005 military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip ended up with a takeover of the territory by the Islamist group Hamas. In every presidential election in recent memory, a majority of American Jews have voted for the Democratic candidate. Israel’s center-left Labour Party has not won an election since 1999.The result is a slow but steady sense of alienation of American Jews from the Israeli political system. A growing number of American Jews look at Israel and see a country that is occupying Palestinian territory and breaking up peaceful Palestinian protests using force and a Jewish state that only recognizes one socially conservative strand of Jewry, Orthodox Judaism, as legitimate — which manifests in things like preventing liberal American Jews from praying in mixed gender groups at the Western Wall, the holiest prayer site in Judaism.The Pew data shows a clear age gap here: Younger American Jews are, overwhelmingly, more skeptical about Israel’s political direction than their older peers. Five times as many American Jews between the ages of 18 and 29 think the United States is “too supportive” of Israel as those over the age of 65. Only a third of Jews between the ages of 18 and 49 believe Israel’s government is making a sincere attempt at peace with the Palestinians; the number is 10 points higher among Jews ages 50 and up.Natalie Portman, age 36, is one of the most prominent members of the younger cohort of American Jews. Her decision to cancel the speech serves not only as an example of tensions between liberal America and conservative Israel boiling over, but actually stokes the conflict: She is serving as a role model, a Jew and Zionist in good standing who’s willing to take a vocal stand against the Israeli government.This is why prominent Israeli politicians — who are, notably, right-wing — have called for her citizenship to be stripped, or tried to marginalize her as somehow anti-Semitic. They worry, not without cause, that she’s a harbinger of future conflict between Israel and its most important international ally. Now, there have always been tensions between Israel and diaspora Jewry. Every community has internal issues. But the ideological divide, particularly with respect to the Palestinians and the synagogue-state divide, has never been sharper. Brent Sasley, a political scientist at the University of Texas Arlington, tells me this an example of “the harmful global effects of the rise of the neo-nationalist/religious right in Israel” on Israel’s relationship with the diaspora — and it’s hard to argue with him.So long as Israel continues its rightward drift, incidents like this will almost certainly become more and more common.

"In the West Bank, Israeli settlers are on an anti-Palestinian rampage",2023-11-09,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Since October 7, settler radicals have been attacking Palestinians at an unprecedented rate — uprooting entire communities and threatening a wider war.On Friday afternoon, I sat at home and waited to find out if Tariq Hathaleen was alive.Tariq is an activist and English teacher in the Palestinian village of Umm al-Khair located in the West Bank, the land to the east of Israel that’s home to nearly 3 million Palestinians and would make up the heart of any future Palestinian state. He and I had just been connected by a mutual acquaintance, who suggested that Tariq would be a good person to talk to about the wave of violence unleashed against West Bank Palestinians while the world’s eyes were focused on Gaza.Radical Israeli settlers, who intentionally build communities in the West Bank, routinely harass and assault their Palestinian neighbors. The settlers attack their herds, burn their property, beat them, and even kill them. This violence, paired with many more subtle techniques to pressure Palestinians to give up their land, has reached unprecedented levels in the month since the terrorist group Hamas’s massacre in southern Israel on October 7. At least 15 Palestinian communities have been fully displaced. Many of these forcible transfers have happened to Palestinian communities in the South Hebron Hills, the West Bank region where Tariq lives. I was supposed to talk to him about what it was like to live through this at 4 pm on Friday, 11 pm his time. But when I texted, he didn’t answer. When I called, he didn’t answer again. Soon after, he sent me an ominous voice memo.“I was about to answer and call you back, but now there’s military inside the community. We’ll see what happens,” he said.The Israeli military, far from enforcing order, is a major part of the problem: Soldiers frequently abuse Palestinians, nearly always getting away with it. Data from the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din shows over 99 percent of official Palestinian allegations against soldiers between 2017 and 2021 did not yield an indictment, let alone a conviction. Since the war in Gaza began, sources on the ground have reported soldiers becoming even more hostile toward the Palestinians. While some Israeli military activity in the West Bank serves legitimate counterterrorism needs, the day-to-day reality is the Israeli government working hand-in-glove with the settlement movement to seize Palestinian land.The most radical faction in Israel is, in effect, stepping up a longstanding campaign of dispossession: acting, both opportunistically and out of anger, to remove West Bank Palestinians from their homes. This escalation could lead to a deeper entrenchment of Israel’s occupation and, quite possibly, a violent Palestinian response that brings outright war to the West Bank. These developments threaten to further weaken the already-slim prospects of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the foreseeable future.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]But most immediately, the consequences are being felt by the Palestinians under attack — like Tariq. When he told me that soldiers were in his village late at night, it meant something bad could happen — bad enough that I might never talk to him again.I waited past sundown, the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath. I try not to work or use social media on Shabbat, but I had to know if Tariq was okay. Around 7 pm, he called me back: He was safe. This time around, the soldiers hadn’t bothered him — searching only outside Umm al-Khair’s homes rather than inside of them.But the threat was real, based on both his recent experiences and those of other Palestinians. According to the United Nations, over 130 West Bank Palestinians have been killed in the weeks since October 7 — already nearing the entire total of Palestinians killed in the West Bank last year, itself the deadliest in nearly 20 years. Almost all were killed by the Israeli military, while “eight of them, including one child, were gunned down by settler militias, sometimes in army uniform,” per Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. “[In our village] you think about how to live that day, how to stay safe that day, how to stay alive that day,” Tariq told me. “You don’t think about the future.”Israeli settlement in the West Bank, which started after Israel took the territory from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War, grew for two distinct reasons. Understanding their interconnections is crucial to understanding the violence plaguing the West Bank today.In those early days, the settlers themselves tended to be religious radicals, firmly committed to the idea that all of the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea had been biblically granted to Jews and (by extension) to the state of Israel. Israel’s government encouraged settlement for more pragmatic reasons. A few settlements, established in key places alongside military bases, could serve to protect Israeli control over Jerusalem and provide “strategic depth” in the event of a Jordanian invasion from the east, which was then a real possibility.Today, the security situation is completely different. Israel has had a formal peace treaty with Jordan for nearly 30 years and, bolstered by its close relationship with the US, is so militarily powerful that neither Jordan nor any other neighboring Arab state would dream of trying to conquer it. Its greatest security threat comes from Iran and its non-state terrorist proxies, including both Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon.But the settler movement has long taken on a life of its own. Religious nationalists streamed into the West Bank; quite a few less fanatical Israelis, lured by relatively cheap housing prices in the settlements, followed suit. While many of these settlers live close to the “Green Line” — the border between Israel proper and the West Bank — many others live farther out. Settlers established these far-flung communities, sometimes legally and other times illegally, with an eye toward cutting Palestinian communities off from each other.The radical religious settlers make up a small percentage of the overall Israeli population, but they have allies on the mainstream right, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu and many in his Likud Party oppose a Palestinian state on security grounds, worrying it would become a launching pad for rocket fire and terrorist incursions. Together, the settlers and their allies employ a laundry list of legalistic tools — ranging from housing subsidies to the national parks service — to assist in settler land grabs.And all Israeli governments, not just Netanyahu’s, have felt obligated to ensure their citizens’ security, settlers included. To protect them from Palestinian militants, Israel uses troops to block Palestinians from going near settlements, builds settler-only roads leading to and from Israel, and places hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks impeding Palestinian movement around the West Bank.Settlement, in short, is not merely isolated acts from individual radicals; it is a wholly owned project of the Israeli state. It is no surprise that Israeli soldiers have long turned a blind eye to settler violence against Palestinians; they’re there to protect the settlers, and sometimes even align with the settler agenda. The interplay of religious fanaticism and Israeli security concerns has created an ever-deepening colonial project in the West Bank.“The relationship of military and settlers is so symbiotic that the system cannot go against itself,” says Yehuda Shaul, director of the left-wing Israeli Center for Public Affairs.Over the past two years, things have gotten much worse — especially since Netanyahu returned to power in the very last days of 2022, helming one of the country’s most extreme right-wing coalitions. According to a September UN report, there had been roughly two settler attacks on Palestinians per day in 2022, a doubling of the previous year’s average. In the first eight months of 2023, the daily average went up to three — the highest figure since the UN began recording data on the topic in 2006. The violence between 2022 and August 2023 displaced roughly 1,100 Palestinians and emptied four communities, with scant accountability. The UN found that while 81 percent of Palestinian communities reported incidents to Israeli authorities, only 6 percent said they were aware of Israel acting on the provided information. In the current government, the minister in charge of settlement policy is Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the far-right Religious Zionist party who is himself a settler extremist. After settlers attacked the Palestinian town of Huwara in February, Smotrich said, “I think that Huwara needs to be erased.”So when the October 7 attacks happened, things were already getting worse. Since then, the dire situation has become a true crisis.Since the Hamas attack, the pace of settler violence has more than doubled — reaching an average pace of seven attacks a day. The scale of displacement has escalated accordingly, with nearly four times as many communities depopulated in the past month as in the preceding year and eight months. Of the 29 Palestinians killed by settlers in 2023, eight have died in the past month alone.Part of the reason is very simple: The settlers thrive on impunity. When fewer people are paying attention to them, they feel like they have a greater ability to act without pushback from their opponents inside Israel and around the world. Like all Israelis, they were infuriated by the attacks of October 7; unlike almost all other Israelis, they have both the motive and the opportunity to take out their anger on Palestinian neighbors.“The focus on Gaza has created a fog that allows ... settlers to create facts on the ground that they believe to be irreversible,” says Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch.The government has condemned the violence but done little to stop it. If anything, some elements of the current Israeli leadership have encouraged their rampage.During the war, a far-right parliamentarian named Zvi Sukkot became the new chair of the legislative subcommittee on West Bank affairs. Sukkot is an extremist settler who has been arrested at least four times on suspicion of radical activity, including lighting a mosque on fire. While he will have limited concrete powers, his appointment sends a signal that settler violence will be tolerated.There’s another factor at work here, too, one that has to do with the nature of wartime mobilization.Typically, the foot soldiers deployed to the West Bank are conscripts — young Israelis just out of high school fulfilling their mandatory military service. But during wartime, these conscripts are needed elsewhere. Currently, they’re deployed either in and around Gaza or else on the northern border with Lebanon, positioned in anticipation of potential escalation with Hezbollah.To supplement its wartime forces, Israel has called up at least 360,000 reservists — roughly 4 percent of its entire population. Many of these reservists are directly involved in the war effort. But in at least some parts of the West Bank, the reservists are being drawn from local communities — which is to say, the settlements. As a result, some settlers who were assailing Palestinians as private citizens are now formally in charge of their security. “It’s not that the military accompanies the settlers. Now the military is the settlers,” Shaul says.These three factors — the focus on Gaza, the government’s indifference, and the settler penetration of the military — have created a kind of perfect storm leading to a spike in settler violence.And now, Palestinians like Tariq Hathaleen are paying the price.There are a number of armed Palestinian militants in the West Bank, including both a smallish Hamas presence and the newly formed “Lions’ Den” faction. These groups’ activities are both a cause and consequence of settler violence; their attacks lead to settler retaliation, but their own incentives to violence arise in the wake of land grabs.The more egregious the settlers’ actions become, the more likely Palestinian militants are to respond with brutal violence of their own. The more violent they get, the more settlers and the Israeli military will retaliate. And the more Israel inflicts violence on Palestinians, the more likely it is that violence erupts into a full-fledged uprising across the West Bank.“I smell blood in the West Bank,” an unnamed Palestinian official told the Economist. “I don’t know where it will be, but it is coming: the settlers are going to do something terrible.”The settler attacks on Palestinians, while occurring under the aegis of Israel’s military, are thus actually endangering the country’s security while it focuses on the tough task of fighting Hamas in Gaza.“Hamas has a crucial ally in the West Bank: the settlers,” says Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute.Israel is aware of the risk here. The US government has become increasingly vocal about its fears of West Bank escalation; President Joe Biden has publicly and privately demanded that Israel do more to put a stop to the settler violence.This is definitely within Israel’s power, but there’s a question of will. Netanyahu is on incredibly shaky political ground as resentment over October 7 and his response to it simmers; he remains in office by the grace of far-right settler parties, who care primarily about seizing West Bank land. If Netanyahu crosses them by ordering a crackdown on settler violence, there’s a real chance they’ll punish him by leaving the governing coalition — collapsing his government and costing him the position he seems to value above all else. Israel today is in the exact opposite position it was in 1967. The interests of the state and settlers are no longer aligned; the settlers’ religious quest for land is increasingly jeopardizing Israeli security. The question is whether the settlers have become influential enough to override what is, in theory, the number one obligation of the Israeli state: keeping its citizens safe.But security is not the only reason that some Israelis oppose the settlers. A minority, but a meaningfully sized one, care deeply about Palestinian rights and are willing to do something about it.At the end of my conversation with Tariq, it was deep into the night in the West Bank. He told me something extraordinary: that, as we spoke, there were two Israelis still sleeping in his home, part of a contingent that voluntarily offers their bodies as protection from settler violence. They are not only his friends, but representatives of a different Israel than that of the settlers.If there is to be a solution to both settler violence and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it will involve gestures like this: Israelis and Arabs working together against the extremists to build a common future. As dark as things look in the West Bank and Gaza today, we can at least take some comfort in the idea that this spirit isn’t entirely dead.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What the siege of Jenin signals about the future of Israel and Palestine,2023-07-06,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:The Israeli raid on Jenin appears over. But the next one could come at any time.This week, Israeli forces besieged the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. It was perhaps the biggest escalation there in two decades. It’s also of a piece with the policies of the current Israeli government. On Monday, Israeli forces conducted an operation with airstrikes and military personnel. About 1,000 Israeli troops entered Jenin over those two days, according to the Israeli press, in what the government said was a counterterrorism operation. At least 12 Palestinians were killed, several of them militants; over 100 Palestinians were wounded; and one Israeli soldier was killed. The Palestinian health ministry said that water and electricity systems in Jenin were damaged, and ambulances were blocked from reaching those in need of care. Amid the aerial attacks and bulldozers, thousands of Palestinians fled from their homes in Jenin. While many may return after homes are reconstructed, those shocking images were reminiscent of the catastrophe of 1948, which Palestinians call the Nakba, when some 750,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes. An “ongoing Nakba, a never-ending trauma,” is how Inès Abdel Razek, the advocacy director for the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy, described the situation. “You’re being displaced and re-displaced and denied your dignity and the right to be free within your homeland.” The Israeli attack represents a major escalation and the most intensive campaign in the West Bank since perhaps 2002, when Israeli forces destroyed parts of Jenin. But it also builds on an exceedingly violent year in Jenin and across the occupied West Bank, including ongoing Israeli raids on Palestinian homes there to crack down on grassroots resistance groups that use violence against the Israeli military. In May 2022, prominent Palestinian American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot dead covering the Israeli raids of Palestinian homes in Jenin.Though Israeli forces appear to have ended the campaign on Jenin, experts told me that there are risks of this continuing and such large-scale attacks on West Bank cities becoming the new reality. This year so far has seen a tremendous number of Palestinian deaths in the West Bank, more than 130 Palestinians killed so far this year, and is on track to overwhelmingly surpass 2022, which itself had set a tragic milestone, more than anytime in the past 15 years, of 146 Palestinians killed in the West Bank. Many factors have contributed to this tense and dangerous moment. The Israeli occupation of the West Bank has resulted in daily injustice for Palestinians since 1967, and that has been supercharged by the current extreme-right Israeli government that is emboldening settler violence, the annexation of Palestinian land, and settlement expansion. That encroachment has led to both new armed Palestinian militant groups and individual acts of violence — like last week when an Israeli military raid in Jenin killed seven Palestinians, seemingly leading to a retaliatory Palestinian shooting of four Israeli settlers, which then led to more settler violence against Palestinians, all within three days. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has supported what it referred to as an Israeli policy of “self defense,” further empowering the Israeli government at a time when Israelis had grown divided over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposed judicial overhaul. For their part, young Palestinians are disenfranchised and see a Palestine Liberation Organization that offers no hope for political rights. So while the attack on Jenin represents a radical departure, it is also part of the way the Israeli occupation works. At any point, the next campaign could begin, in Jenin or in another city. The shape and scale of this attack was new. The journalist Amjad Iraqi, writing in +972 Magazine, described the Israeli operation on Jenin as the Gazafication of the West Bank. Israel has blockaded the occupied territory of Gaza for years and aggressively bombed Palestinians there as part of its counterterrorism campaigns in recent years. Hamas, which Israel and the US consider a terrorist group, in effect runs the government there. Palestinian militants have launched rockets into Israeli territory, and in response, Israel conducts operations against militants there that it calls “mowing the grass.” But that violent process has largely stayed in the confines of Gaza.With over 600,000 Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, the territory has not experienced such an intensive bombardment. But now that dynamic appears to have changed. The strict Israeli military occupation of the West Bank has largely rooted out the kind of organized resistance factions that have threatened Israeli national security interests. But a new generation of Palestinians has begun to resort to violence in response to the Israeli military, settler violence, and against Israelis in other situations. The Israeli government described its military activity in Jenin as self-defense. “We’re not trying to hold the ground. We’re acting against specific targets,” said Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht.These grassroots military groups have attacked Israeli soldiers, but analysts have questioned the extent of the threat that disparate Palestinian groups represent beyond occasional, uncoordinated attacks. “Their offensive operations have been confined to occasional, small-scale attacks on Israeli military outposts, checkpoints and settlers,” according to the International Crisis Group’s field reporting. “As things stand today, this new generation of armed groups does not yet seem to pose a major security threat. Interviews with residents, Fatah members and PA officials in Nablus suggest that the groups are small, disjointed and scattered, without clear leadership.”Tariq Kenney-Shawa, an analyst with the Palestinian research network Al-Shabaka, emphasizes the power asymmetry between the Israeli military and Palestinian military groups. “In Jenin refugee camp, they’re defending themselves from an Israeli invasion of the camp. They’re engaging in armed confrontations with soldiers who are part of one of the most advanced and most well-trained militaries on this planet, that has access to some of the best technology out there,” he told me.Experts have been warning of a third intifada, or uprising, among Palestinians given their intense disenfranchisement at a time when the Israeli government appears to be moving forward with normalization deals with Arab states and leaving Palestinians behind. Israel might have conducted this week’s raid to weaken organized resistance groups, but experts said it might only further inflame resistance.Ayman Yousef, a political scientist at Arab American University in Jenin, says the attacks have brought about “a huge solidarity among Palestinians.” He worries that this unification among Palestinians will cause Israel to view this operation as a failure, which could lead to further escalatory and retaliatory measures from Israel, including the possibility of targeted assassinations. “There is a backlash of this Israeli operation, a kind of reverse result, in that people are more prepared to fight till the last drop, as they say,” he told me. Jenin looms large in Palestinian life and has been an epicenter of Palestinian resistance. In 1953, the refugee camp was established, and nearly 50 years later during the second intifada, Israeli forces used jets and bulldozers to destroy parts of the camp. “The young people in the camp are still refugees today; their grandparents, or great-grandparents, had been expelled from Haifa by what became the Israeli army,” Abdel Razak explained. “We’re looking at a generation that’s only known the violence of the second intifada and its aftermath.”“You’re talking about a camp and city with neighborhoods that are completely destroyed, still besieged, still unfree, and now with damaged infrastructure, being separated and confined, like Israel did with Gaza,” Abdel Razak added. “If we are not addressing the root causes of apartheid and simply now go back to the situation of a few days ago, when is the next time?” A former Israeli official told the New York Times that the next raid could come anytime, “even tomorrow.”The Israeli government pursuing the raids and attacks of Jenin are the most extreme right-wing in the country’s history. And many of its leaders in key cabinet positions have been clear in their intentions. In June, when Palestinian gunmen killed four in the West Bank, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir threatened retribution against the West Bank, referring to it by the name that Israeli settlers often use. “It’s time for a military operation in Judea and Samaria, and to take down buildings from the air,” he said.As Abdel Razak told me, “Even with such an Israeli government that is so blunt, and so clear of their intentions, international impunity is as strong as ever.”The Biden administration has drawn the line by not meeting with the most extreme cabinet members and representatives of this Israeli government. And last month, the US said it was “deeply troubled” by the Israeli Defense Ministry’s announcement of 5,000 new settlements in the West Bank. But even as US public opinion has begun to shift toward a more favorable view of Palestinians, that level of forthright condemnation has been lacking in the past few days with respect to Jenin, with the exception of a few members of Congress. “We support Israel’s security and right to defend its people against Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups,” the White House said. And a State Department spokesperson said, “It is imperative to take all possible precautions to prevent the loss of civilian lives.”“Because an operation like Jenin doesn’t get any condemnation, it basically gives a passive green light to the government to continue with such operations,” says Mairav Zonszein of the International Crisis Group.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Russia and China are waging a ""shadow war"" against the US, and the battlefields will be AI and space, CNN’s Jim Sciutto says",2019-06-11,Vox,['Eric Johnson'],"Filed under:Hacking and election interference were just the start.If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Over the past two-and-a-half years, you’ve probably heard a lot about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election — but that is just one of several ways Russia is trying to undermine the US, CNN’s Jim Sciutto writes in his new book The Shadow War.“We’re already in a war without realizing it,” Sciutto said on the latest episode of Recode Decode with Kara Swisher. “And certainly the public’s not aware of it, and our leaders are not speaking of it in those terms … you’re getting attacked on other fronts [besides election interference] and losing ground on other fronts.”Sciutto’s book compares the efforts of two nations that are adversarial to US interests, Russia and China. He calls their efforts a shadow war, in part, because the “battlefields” where conflict is occurring aren’t necessarily visible to the naked eye.”You’ve got space weapons, with military intent,” he said. “You’ve got an arms race under the waves, again with military intent. And as in any sort of asymmetric battlefield, these are the spaces where Russia, and China too, calculate that they can compete with us. They can’t build 12 aircraft carriers tomorrow, but they’ve got very good submarines. And then you have the broader cyber issue.“Some [American intelligence officials] make the argument to me that AI is already in play, in some ways,” Sciutto added. “Because in cyberspace, of course the decisions are made in microseconds that human beings can’t complicate. So already those tools are operating somewhat independently from human control, to some degree, at least in the moment.”You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts, and Overcast.Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Jim.Kara Swisher: Hi, I’m Kara Swisher, editor-at-large of Recode. You may know me as someone who thinks the world should make shadow love, not shadow war, but in my spare time I talk tech and you’re listening to Recode Decode from the Vox Media Podcast Network. Today in the red chair is Jim Sciutto, the chief national security correspondent for CNN and co-anchor of its daily CNN Newsroom. He’s also the author of recently released book The Shadow War: Inside Russia’s and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America, which is quite pertinent right now. Jim, welcome to Recode Decode. Jim Sciutto: Thanks so much for having me. All right.Real pleasure. Well, you know, you told me Poppy, your co-host, Poppy Harlow, she’s your publicist. She’s a great partner and I’m lucky to have her. She said, “You have to have him on or else!” I don’t know what the or else part was, but I would be happy because it’s a great recommendation because this is a topic that I talk about a lot. You cover national security and obviously cybersecurity is an important part of it. I’ve been spending a lot of time with Ash Carter, a bunch of other people talk about the topic. He’s in the book. He’s in the book. Exactly, that’s what I was talking about. So let’s talk a little bit, I want to get to the book in a second, but talk about your background, how you got to what you’re doing, including covering national security and anchoring CNN, which is sort of in the middle of ... It itself has become a topic in this administration. Yes, a target. Just the other day, he did it again with AT&T. The stock went up, though, which means uh-oh. Anyway...So I started my reporting career as a foreign correspondent. I always wanted to be overseas and sort of chase the stories.Why? What did you do in high school that made you want to do this?Well, I’ll tell you. The origin story, and it’s interesting because we, having just passed the 30th Anniversary of Tiananmen Square ... I was a freshman in college, the end of my freshman year in May 1989. I had a sister, I have three sisters, but another sister was interested in China, she was living over there at the time, and my parents and another sister went to visit her. And they found themselves in Beijing in late May 1989, taking family pictures inside the pro-democracy protest there. They left the day that martial law was declared and then in the succeeding days, they of course read about, and saw on television, the horrible events that took place afterwards.Mm-hmm, which was very critical to happen on television, too.Absolutely. And those images, they were heartbreaking for them because they’d met many of these young students and it was such an exhilarating time to be there. In fact, I found these the other day. My mom saved all these newspapers from around the region reporting the news of the events of the early morning, June 4th, 1989. So I choose my major, and a lot of folks looking at American political history this or that and I said, you know what, I’m gonna study China, because there’s something going on over there and I wanna know about it. That turned out to be my major. And after college, I went out to Asia ...Study China meaning learn Chinese, or what was the ...Well, study Chinese history and politics and culture. And then after college, I decided I wanted to go live there. I did a Fulbright Scholarship that took me out there, and then I ended up staying out there as a reporter traveling around the region, this was in the early ’90s, mid ’90s. And it just gave me a bug on the country, the region, the culture, but also a bug for getting paid to travel the world and bring back stories.Mm-hmm. So foreign correspondent, right.Yeah. Yeah.Do you speak Chinese?I do. Kinda lousy when I’m not in the country, but when I returned recently and I did a stint in government, that I dove right right back into it and I was decent, I was pretty decent.Early to that.And so you wanted to be a foreign correspondent, you didn’t want to go into diplomacy or the state department. I wanted to be in the state department, you know that? I went to the Foreign Service School in Georgetown.You did?Yes.Well you, okay. So when ...I wanted to be a spy, Jim.We all wanted to sorta be a spy.No. I wanted to be a spy. I wanted to be Robert Redford in Three Days of the Condor, I wanted to be an analyst that analyzed scenario building.I could see you doing ... Well I’ll tell you ...It’s what I do now. Do you know I’m a spy right now? It’s the longest con in history, but go ahead.I would believe it.Think about it.When I was in college I did think about foreign service but I looked at the folks who took the foreign service exam and felt like I couldn’t pull it off. I just didn’t feel like I knew enough and I was intimidated by it. Later in my career, the only other path that I considered following, besides journalism, was government in some way. And that would come up years later when I was offered this job as chief of staff to the ambassador of China, this is just in 2011, and I took that job and I explored that for a couple years and I’m glad I did, and I learned a lot. But I still think my nature is a journalist so I came back to the fold.So you’re doing foreign correspondent ... what got you into national security?So I went over to London for ABC, after 9/11 basically. 9/11 happened, I went to cover the attacks at the Pentagon, I was based in Washington at the time, but immediately afterwards I raised my hand I said, “I wanna go cover, I wanna cover the aftermath of this. I wanna go to Afghanistan, and I wanna go cover the region.” And I did. I went there in early 2002 and ended up staying and I was based in London but staying covering the region for a decade to follow. I went to Iraq a dozen times, went to Afghanistan a dozen times, Iran a dozen times, all over there, Israel, Palestine, you name it.And that, covering the wars, covering the intelligence behind the wars, covering the terror attacks that followed, and efforts to prevent terror attacks, that got me into the national security space. And I sort of never gave it up, it was just interesting to me and substantive, and a little bit exciting.And so what brought you to CNN, then? You were at the major networks, and then of course lots of people moved back and forth between them.So I did more than a decade with ABC, principally overseas.That’s right.Came back to Washington in 2010-11, was really bored to be back.Covering Washington.At home, covering Washington. I didn’t have that excitement of hopping on a plane every couple of weeks to go somewhere new or exotic. And I went to the White House Correspondents dinner in 2011.I’m so sorry.And I found myself ... Although that was back when they still told jokes, so you know ...I hate that thing. Oh no, I never liked that thing, it was all too close with their sources. It always made me nervous.And a little too many celebrities to look at, they got down there. But I went there and I got lucky because sitting next to me was the new ambassador to China, Gary Locke. Just appointed, and he was about to be sent over, and we got to talking about China, we talked the whole dinner about China. And then that followed with a lunch and then another dinner, and he came to offer me a job as his chief of staff.He said, “Listen, I’ve been looking for someone, not a typical candidate for this job, someone a little outside the box, who can give me a different perspective of these things, how would you like to go?” And the first question I asked was to my wife. We had two young kids, and she said, “I’m game.” And she’s a journalist as well, she still works for ABC news, so she was excited by it and the prospect of taking our kids over there to absorb the place and learn something. So once I had her approval, I said yes, I’ll take a risk and dive in.And how was that stint?So, on the good side, I learned a lot, I was right in the middle of this country and this relationship with this country that I’d studied for a number of years. I had a high level security clearance, so reading the intelligence. I was in the room for many tense high-level meetings and in the midst of difficult decisions between the US and China. I was literally a fly on the wall, right?So how was that different to being a journalist, how bad are we at doing our job?Well it’s funny, I think that we have the impression that the folks on the inside know everything.Oh, I don’t have that impression.Well, or that they have access to knowing so much, they have access to the intelligence and surveillance satellites and intercepted communications and all this kind of stuff.Oh I think it’s a goat rodeo, but go ahead. Because I’ve been on the inside of internet companies, so that’s why ...Fair enough. You know.No, I just assume it’s the same in government and everywhere else.And I learned that lesson. I think that at the end of the day, you realize just like in companies, it’s imperfect people with imperfect information, making imperfect decisions. Often doing their darnedest, right? But you know, there’s no all-knowing anyone in these circumstances, so I certainly learned that. And I’m not questioning motivations, because I met a lot of dedicated Americans who really love their country and they’re fighting hard to do the best they can. But they make mistakes too, and a lot of them. The other frustration was that journalism, as you know, is a very self-driving business. You take the initiative, it’s your product, you’re developing a product every day. And government is a top-down kind of structure, it’s like a military organization, chain of command, and that’s slow and frustrating and a little confining, so I did it for a couple years, learned a lot and said, “You know what, I’m a journalist, I’m going back.”Right. And so you go back to CNN?Mm-hmm.How did that happen?Well, I kept relationships while I was there, but oftentimes ...But an anchor, that’s a big job.Well, first they took me back as a national security ...You look like an anchor.Oh thank you so much. There’s a lot of work went into this.It may not be a compliment, but go ahead.First, I came back as national security correspondent, the anchoring came later. But they knew that I had the chops for it because I’d spent a lot of time on the ground in these countries. And I think that kind of on-the-ground experience is often lacking in Washington. One, yes, you can operate under any circumstances and make it happen, but two, I’d been to Iran. If we’re talking about Iran, I’ d been there, I’d been inside the government plans, I’d been inside the wars, you know, I wasn’t dealing with theoretical knowledge of this stuff, I was dealing with first-hand knowledge, so that helped.I don’t know if you found in your career, I do often find in a career, that your best opportunities, I don’t wanna say they come out of the blue, but I was lucky at that point that I wanted to come back, that there was a position, and they were looking for someone like me, and I went for it.No. No, I do, I do think it’s important to have on-the-ground things, some of the times, everyone’s like, “That’s your opinion,” I’m like, “No I covered it for years, I really am right.” I mean, I’m actually accurate as opposed to, you just are sayin’ it and stuff like this. So it’s an interesting thing, it’s really important to have operational experience, no matter what you’re doing. So you do the show everyday, and it’s a daily show that you have to, like, be clever for two hours a day, essentially.Yes.People always insult anchors, but you have to be quick and facile, a lot. You do.It must be exhausting.Poppy and I, we blow up the playbook every day, ‘cause news breaks, particularly during doing our hours, we do 9-11. You’d have committee hearings, etc.Yes. They do. Trump tweets something, always. There’s always a tweet.Exactly. And I think the day, when I was at ABC and you had the old-school evening news broadcast, very scripted. You knew what they were gonna say. Cable news in this era, when you have a lot of live interviews with newsmakers, you have news breaking during your hour, very little of it is scripted. We do our homework. Poppy and I work hard, we know the issues before we go in. But you’re reacting in the moment and you gotta do it with some intelligence and knowledge and respect and that can be challenging, but it’s fun.When you think about the impact … just previously, ‘cause I was telling you about the corrosive effects of cable sometimes and it’s true, how do you look at that? I would say the evening ones are more ... You’re more news-driven, essentially.Mm-hmm, we are. And that means reactive, it does.But news-driven versus opinion-driven, if that makes sense.Of course.There’s actual news happening, there’s a shooting or something. You know, this week there’s been like 10 things, right? So, talk about that concept of what’s happening now. Because you’d worked at broadcast and this is not that.You’re right. People ask me a lot, do we have an editorial line at CNN, am I encouraged to follow an editorial line? And the answer is no, we’re encouraged to follow the news. Our bosses care about getting it right, whenever we’re accused of fake news or making stuff up, or making sources up, and you know where that criticism comes from, I say guys, you don’t know how vetted our reporting is. Particularly in this era, the stories I do, particularly when it’s sensitive stuff, never been more vetted than anything I’ve worked on in my life. What are the sources, multiple sources, let’s make sure the language is precise, let’s go back to them, I want more clarity on this or that. The level of vetting in editorial, not control but editorial standards, higher than I’ve ever experienced in the business. So, one, we gotta get it right. Two, we do our best to avoid an editorial slant. I think the bigger challenge is, and one reason I wrote a book, is that you don’t often get the opportunity to connect the dots and provide context.Right. Right. It’s the next ...It’s the next thing.It’s the hot take, it’s the twitchy culture, it’s Twitter, twitchy culture really.Exactly. So, that’s one thing I think we could do better, we could do better for people. And when I talk to my sort of unscientific focus group of friends and family, I think that’s what people are clamoring for, it’s like okay, I know it’s happening but I’m hearing it from 27 different angles, tell me why I care, how this fits into the bigger picture, why is this different, how should I prioritize? And that’s something that we try to do every day.Why can’t it be like that on cable? This is why I do a podcast, because it’s long in substance, you’re bringing substantive to discussion, even our short ones are substantive.Yes. We do. I mean listen, we do, we try. Of course, you could be doing that and then, heck, something else happens, right? Some guy walks out of the committee, it is reactive.Right, that’s what I mean. It’s reactive, reactive, reactive.I try to look at it from my career, just as a journalist, that you’re a voice over time, and you just do your best to add value over time.Right. Right. How do you operate under the pressure of being called things? CNN is the one that’s most targeted, again this week he just targeted y’all. What do you do in those ... and sometimes, some of your evening anchors really get a little emotional. You don’t, it’s really interesting, you don’t have a lot of opinion, it doesn’t feel like it, you don’t shade it as much. Whatever it is, I think they shade more on Fox News, but they shade a lot on CNN and MSNBC, they definitely shade.I think just with primetime broadcast, a little bit different, it’s just not my style. I try to play it as much ...But you still suffer from the consequences.I do. So, big picture, we do our best to ignore it, because the only direction, like I said, I get from my boss is just get it right and work hard. Frankly, it encourages the mission of journalism, when you’re under attack with purpose, because the fake news attacks are with purpose.Oh no. On purpose, yes. You’re being used for an end.So that, and Trump even said it, in the famous Leslie Stahl interview he said, I attack you because when you have critical information, I can then undermine the source. I mean, Trump said it in so many words. So that makes you know even more so what your role is, expose wrongdoing, shine light on issues that don’t have light shone on them. And that’s, on the positive side, mission affirming, so that’s one thing. Two, ignore the BS. I just ignore it, ya know, because I, at the end of the day, I actually think that his attacks have less impact over time, I think people are getting more numb to them, to some degree. There is the very serious side to it, is that some people do listen, and there’s a reason why we have armed guards at CNN today. And there’s a reason why you have guards at Trump events guarding the press pen, because some people do listen to those attacks.There’s a reason why, when Poppy and I were on the air in September and CNN had received the bomb, that guy was listening. So, it’s important, but our reaction is to just put the nose down and move forward.Do you think journalists should pull back a little bit? Some people think ... No, don’t.Absolutely not.Right. Not pull back on ...Forget about it.Forget about it. All right so, getting into substance. In the next section we’re gonna talk about, how you decided to do this book and what you’re thinking about it. When did you write this book?I wrote it on planes, trains, and in coffee shops. I didn’t take time off, I wrote it between January of last year and July, 80,000 words, and I just said I’m gonna write 10,000 words a month, 2,500 words a week.What was the impetus for writing it, what were you trying to do?The impetus was that I spent years covering these countries — China and Russia — on multiple fronts of what I would perceive as this shadow war. And it struck me that folks weren’t connecting the dots on this, not just members of the public, journalists, the way we write about these stories, but also our leaders weren’t connecting the dots on what, when you look at the full picture, is a strategy.It’s a strategy by both Russia and China to undermine the US on multiple fronts and the fact is, both of them are very explicit in that strategy, they write about it. And I wrote it, my motivation was, as a concerned American. That I spent all these years in these places, and I feel that my country is being undermined in a way that is worrisome. I want my kids to experience a world as free as the one I grew up in, or a country as prosperous as the one I grew up in, and you have two countries that are intent on undermining that.Now let’s be clear, these two countries have always been trying to undermine the United States, right?True.But one of the things I find interesting, is, look, Russia lost the Cold War, lost it cold, like completely lost it. China, same thing, was never able to make the kind of incursions that they had hoped. But they’ve used technology to do so. Yes.You know what I mean? But first talk about the history of their attempts, the non-shadow war, because it went on and on, and largely they lost to our economic vitality, the freedom/democracy just worked better for a lot more people, and a lot more people lived better.Well that’s going back to the Cold War. So the Cold War ends in ’91, the Soviet Union collapses, and at the same time ... I’m not entirely equating Russia and China, but there are parallels to the development of this.No, they’re different.At the same time, China is liberalizing its economy.Economics.Economically, making enormous strides. And in both cases, the US ...And meanwhile, Russia’s not and is just sort of ... Except they have oil, right?But in the ’90s, remember, we had this impression that things were different. End of history, Russia and China want to play by our rules now. And if we engage them and bring them into the international fold, not only are we going to make friends with them, but they’re going to liberalize at home and modernize, democratize, all this kind of stuff, even in the face of years of contradictory evidence and information.Decades.That delusion persisted. And the folks I interview in this book, who were serving in high positions during this time, are self-critical in their analysis. They say that we could not give up this delusion ... this ... “mirroring” is a word that comes up a lot.Explain what that means, mirroring.It means thinking that they want what we want. Thinking that they’re a mirror image of our interests and our motivations. But they’re not. First of all, they have a different view of ...I want you to differentiate between them, too.Between Russia and China?Yeah.I will. Russia ... and again, there’s some generalizing going on here, but the way folks will describe it: Russia’s a zero-sum gameplayer. They see it as an advantage, any way they pull us down: politically, election interference, militarily, etc. China really wants to supplant us. Right?Yes. That’s right.As the dominant power in the world. So you’ve got Russia playing spoiler, China playing genuine competitor.Russia can’t dominate.They can’t. As folks often say, they’ve got an economy about the size of one US state. China’s got an economy that’s going to surpass us at some point. Those are the ...A spoiler and a supplanter. That’s a good way to put it.And one of the consistent themes of the book, though, is that the constant missed signals, the constant misreading ... And another point I make — and again, it’s not a political book because there’s a lot of blame to go around, Democratic and Republican administrations — but each president comes in and says, “I can get this right.” George W. Bush looked into Putin’s eye, “I see a guy could work with.” Things go pear-shaped afterwards. Obama, “reset button.” Things go pear-shaped. Of course, Donald Trump is still in that space. He’s like, “I can get this right.” But it hasn’t worked out so well.Yeah. Well, acquiescence seems to be his strategy.Yeah.I would have been fascinated by a Hillary Clinton presidency with Putin. That would have been one ugly fight.There’s a reason Putin did not want her to be president.Of course. Absolutely.Of course not. She had his number. The women know.Classic. They always do.The women always know a creep. So we went up to the Cold War. We basically won the Cold War. We were doing very well economically, even though China was growing, too. But in general, we’re still the dominant country of the world, essentially. Talk about how each of them then started to make different ... that you describe in your book.To make different decisions?Right. Russia, discord ...Russia, discord. And particularly with Putin’s rise, because Putin had a very adversarial relationship or view of the US, and even paranoid to some degree. There’s a fair amount of paranoia that infects his view of ... everything is designed to kind of take him down.Yeah, we never noticed that in his photographs, with his horses and shit. What a fucked-up person that guy is.The topless horseback rider.Honestly, that’s all I need to know, is that picture. But go ahead.Exactly. So Putin was a change for Russia. And I’m not saying Yeltsin was a hero or anything, but there was definitely a change in aggressiveness at that point.And they love him in Russia, by the way. That’s something that people don’t realize. They love Putin, and they’re not being forced to love him.You’re right. And I make that point, for both Russia and China, that neither is anything close to a democracy, but they both have domestic politics. But Putin and Xi are good at appealing to those domestic politics of, “Now is our time. Don’t let America keep us under their thumb. We’re pushing back. This is our time to regain our place in the world.”Right. So Russia, discord. This is through … they use social media, they use technology, hacking, everything.Multiple fronts.So, talk about those.My sense is, Americans are aware of maybe one of the fronts, or two of the fronts? They think about it. Election interference. Okay, no question. We’re talking about that. We’re having a national conversation. Do they know that Russia has deployed weapons in space? They’re up there right now. Kamikaze satellites can take out our satellites. There are directed-energy weapons in space.Is that what they’re called? Kamikaze ...That’s what the Space Command calls them.Right, right. And they’re designed to hurt our communication systems?They’re designed to take them out. And not just communications: surveillance satellites, nuclear early-warning satellites, GPS, on which a whole host of military technologies depend. Smart bombs aren’t smart. Drones don’t fly. Etc. I’m assuming we have the same weapons up there?Well, no. Not deployed. We have those capabilities, but we haven’t deployed them to the degree that China and Russia had. And that’s a decision that has to be made: Is that the best deterrent? Or does that lead to a space arms race? That’s part of the calculation that has to be made today.Space Force! But go ahead.Space Force, exactly. So, they do that because they know we’re dependent on it. It’s classic asymmetric warfare. And in the event of war, they take that away from us. And it’s also civilian technologies, as you know better than me, depending on space assets. GPS timestamps keep the financial markets going. That’s space. Under the waves, you have a new submarine arms race that’s been underway for years. Russia deploying faster, quieter submarines. Why does that matter? With a submarine that’s faster and quieter, it can pop up off our coastline in the event of war and rain down nuclear warheads, without warning. And they show off that capability. You’ve seen stories about Russian subs popping up off the coast of Florida. US submarine commanders — and I spent time on a US sub under the Arctic where they’re training to track Russian subs — will grant that they can’t track them as well as they used to. And that’s a military change, a technology change, with intent, by Russia. So you’ve got the information ops kind of stuff, election interference. You’ve got space weapons, with military intent. You’ve got an arms race under the waves, again with military intent. And as in any sort of asymmetric battlefield, these are the spaces where Russia, and China too, calculate that they can compete with us. They can’t build 12 aircraft carriers tomorrow ...Not anymore.... but they’ve got very good submarines. And then you have the broader cyber issue, which I know you’ve covered extensively.Disinformation.Disinformation, but also going after critical infrastructure.Infrastructure.They already have the ability to go after water treatment, power grids, etc. So coming back to why I wrote this book, I’ve been covering each of these fronts and I’m not hearing folks — certainly in the White House, but elsewhere — talking about how those fronts fit together. And it is an explicit strategy. And although Russia and China are very different countries, in a thousand different ways, they’ve struck on a similar strategy for undermining the US.All right. So that’s Russia. China?So China, active in those same fronts. It’s got space weapons. Its innovation is what US Space Command calls a “kidnapper satellite.” It’s got a grappling arm that can snatch satellites out of orbit, Moonraker-style. They’re up there, they’re active.So they’re stealing them?They can. They can.They haven’t done it yet. But in the event of a war, they can. And they’ve tested this capability right up to geostationary, so right up to 20,000 miles. To be able to do that, you’ve got to have fantastic maneuverability, situational awareness, etc. They’ve demonstrated that capability. So, China’s in space.China is also under the waves. They don’t do nuclear subs as much as diesel-electric. Diesel-electric is quieter. There was a Chinese sub that popped up in the midst of a US carrier group, without warning, a number of months ago, that scared the bejeezus out of US naval commanders because they didn’t know it was coming.It just popped up?And when you can pop up in the middle of them, of course, you could have already launched the torpedoes and they’re dead. So they’re there. China also does election interference.So China hasn’t been known for this, right?No. They’ve been known for space, obviously.They’ve been known for space. They famously blew up a satellite in space about 10 years ago. But submarine warfare ... China’s ...The accident? You mean the space ... blew up ...Well, they shot a missile to take out a satellite in space.Right, yeah.And whenever a country does it — by the way, the U.S. has done this more than once... we always say, “Well, this satellite is in a degrading orbit, and it threatens people in South America,” whatever.No, they’re just testing the ability ...It’s a missile test. It’s a missile test, yeah.Of course. Whenever there’s an accident I’m like, “That wasn’t an accident.”No.It’s covering up something else, or they were trying to do it.Exactly. China’s missiles are designed to destroy US aircraft carriers. And they’ve had enormous success. If you ever hear anti-access/area denial, that’s a whole ... They create kind of a web of fire that keeps US carriers off the coast. China, by the way, does election interference too. Australia has had particular experience with this. But when China is reducing soybean purchases from Iowa, amidst this trade war, that is trying to maximize pain on Iowa farmers, with political effect in the US, it’s basically election interference. And China has also done probing attacks, like Russia has, of election systems. So they all operate ...But not as much disinformational?Not Russian-troll-farm level stuff. They have the capability of doing it.Of course they do.They haven’t done it. Of course, the other aspect that China has had enormous success — I have a whole chapter on this — is just straight-up stealing state secrets, national security intellectual property and private sector intellectual property. And I tell the story of just a single spy, Stephen Su, who over the course of four years stole hundreds of gigabytes of data on the F-35, the F-22, and the C-17. And today, Russia is flying three jets that look a heck of a lot like the F-35.Russia is?Sorry, China is. F-35, the F-22, and the C-17, because he was so successful, over four years. He was caught by the FBI, but only four years in. And I interviewed the former head of counterintelligence for the FBI, Bob Anderson, who says, “We’re aware of about 10 percent of what China’s doing.” 10 percent.Of what they’re stealing. They’re also, to give them credit, doing a lot of their own technology and spreading it all over the world. And so becoming ... just the way they’re buying up mining, rare earth minerals, everything else. They’re also deploying their technology in places … facial surveillance, they’re giving them to other countries to try to become the dominant technology force in the world, the way the US has been. Huawei is a good example of this.Huawei. Absolutely.I think it’s easy to say they steal everything. They don’t just steal everything. They actually are innovating their way into dominance.I’ve actually been to Huawei’s headquarters in Shenzhen, and credit where credit’s due. They do a good job stealing and that is expressly to catch up to the US, but China is ahead of the game, you know this better than me ...In artificial intelligence.... in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, this kind of thing. They’re damn good at what they do. Of course it helps to cheat too, along the way.Right. Well, it’s not that we don’t cheat. But it’s an interesting question, “Who’s going to dominate the next phase?” is something that’s interesting, that’s been debated. And of course Silicon Valley people are saying, “Let us stay large so that we can compete against China.” It’s never Russia. It’s never Russia. They’re just irritating. Russia’s just irritating. It’s China that, “We need to be big in order to fight China.”My answer’s always, “Do we really want to get in an arms race with China over facial recognition?” for example. Do we? Or will there be two internets? There’ll be two systems. Yeah.That’s what’s going to happen. There’s going to be their system and our system. And then it will be a global race to compete on who dominates in other countries. Is it a western democracy system or is it a Chinese technology-dominated system? We make a lot of things in China. Should we be making our phones in China? I’ve never thought we should.Well, it’s an enormous opening for bad behavior, isn’t it? Rick Ledgett, former deputy director of the NSA, on this he makes the point that China has laws that require their technology companies to work with their security services, beyond the fact that ... Listen, there’s no real firewall between the industries there. You’ve got the straight-up state-owned enterprises and the other ones, but they still have a tight relationship, and directors on the board, whatever.So they’ve got to do it. They’ve got to do it. And that’s a problem. And that’s why when you look, for instance, we spoke about Huawei ...This is going to deploy 5G. But go ahead.You understand why US security services are concerned about it. I remember that moment during Hill testimony when all the intelligence chiefs were there and they were asked about ZTE: Would they use a ZTE phone? And they all said, “No,” because they’re concerned about a back door in a ZTE phone. You look at the Russia thing, too. Why does no government agency use Kaspersky Labs now, right? Because they were worried about ... what was a good technology product ... do you trust that to screen your computer? Probably not.So what do you as an American? I don’t agree with Donald Trump on much, but I’ve got to say, I don’t think we should be using Huawei. I’m kind of like, “Yeah, Huawei’s a problem,” from a national security point of view. I’m not sure that’s why he’s doing it. How can we be working with them? Because obviously China is going to be a technological leader, and so there has to be global cooperation between technology ... Obviously, Apple makes a lot of things in China. Obviously, Google does. Google’s trying to go in there. How do we work with them and at the same time, protect our national security interests?It’s a question. Just beginning with Trump’s addressing this issue ... Credit where credit is due. He’s confronting China on what is a genuine issue, not just trade misbehavior but national security, a true national security threat. So, can you work together on these essential technologies when you have enterprises that abide by government rules, and a country that has calculated that its survival — well, the leadership of that country has calculated that its survival is dependent on control of its own people?Which, a lot of the funding ... I was just at an event where a China expert was telling me about how much money they spend on internal ... The reason they’re so into facial recognition and AI combined is because they need to control this population. Not just the abuses, the marginalized people, they’re doing it ... the spying they’re doing on different groups.Right. The Uighurs, for instance.The Uighurs. The whole population is under surveillance. Absolutely. They have perfected using technology as a means of repression.They have to.Well they’ve calculated that because ...And they have to, to control the country.Well, exactly. Because they’ve calculated, essentially — that’s a bigger conversation, I guess — it’s a crisis of legitimacy because they’ve calculated that they can’t keep this population of 1.4 billion in check without having that kind of control. And that’s a sad fact.Well, when you see the numbers, the estimates on how much they spend on internal surveillance, that’s all it says to me is it’s ...It’s remarkable.They’re worried about dissent.They are.They can’t have dissent.No. I remember when I went to the Huawei headquarters, and this is a number of years ago, I remember walking through — I’m sure they wouldn’t let us do this again — but walking through the quarters, and any door that was open, I felt like there were about a thousand people in there at a terminal. And that’s Huawei, it’s a company that makes a lot of products, that kind of thing.But Bob Anderson, again, former head of counterintel at the FBI, in the chapter on stealing the state secrets, he talks about how China does a great job of just enlisting its intellectual and technological firepower in the service of the government. You’ve got the people who are expressly working for the security agencies; but he says they have, he called it a “national service program” for highly capable technological students to do the work of hacking for the government. So the whole system is built on preserving that power, and using the technology to do so, enlisting people in the service of the government.And then of course there’s AI, in terms of weapons that are done this way. They’re becoming dominant in AI.Yes.Again, not Russia, China.And when I ask the folks ... a lot of this, again, part of the motivation for writing this book is, whenever I would ask senior intelligence officials, “Okay, give me your top five threats,” right? “What keeps you up at night?” They would always have Russia and China at the top of the list. And some would put Russia ahead of China, but most of them put China ahead of Russia. But then when I say, “Okay, so give me the next fields of battle,” and of course they’ll say space. But they all say AI, as well. We’re already there, in some respects, but that’s a next field of competition.And, meaning what? How so?AI is a powerful weapon.And obviously Kai-Fu Lee has written about this.Absolutely. And some make the argument to me that AI is already in play, in some ways. Because in cyberspace, of course the decisions are made in microseconds that human beings can’t complicate. So already those tools are operating somewhat independently from human control, to some degree, at least in the moment. Also, when you speak of drone technology, the systems that manage those swarms of drones, that kind of thing, will have some artificial intelligence and ...Everything.Yeah, fair enough. So ...Yep. I think the issue is that right now, we will debate the ethics of it. We will debate the diversity in it, and they won’t, at all. They don’t.Well, that’s true. No, that’s true.And that’s why we’ll be hindered.Perhaps, perhaps.That’s the argument is that we shouldn’t ... The argument is still well yes, let’s not debate it, let’s just go full steam ahead, which I think is wrong because look where it’s gotten us with social media.So what are the biggest threats right now from each of these countries, and what does defeat look like to them? What’s their goal?So both of them speak in terms of permanent conflict, that this is over time. That there’s no signing ceremony on the Missouri in this. Well, because it’s happening over time, insidiously. And again, with them calculating what is our threshold that they can operate under without sparking a decisive response, right? So it just goes on forever. Just eating away at American advantages, that kind of thing. So for China, though, the ambition is that, to supplant the US economically and militarily, will we know it? I mean, you’re sort of like the frog in the boiling water. The temperature keeps going up. Will we not recognize it until, “Wait a second. We’re no longer the world power.”You know, it’s not going to happen in a day. It’ll happen over the course of many days and years. So they may achieve victory without us realizing it. And that’s, again, part of the reason I write the book is that we’re already in a war without realizing it, right? And certainly the public’s not aware of it, and our leaders are not speaking of it in those terms.Well, they’re a little more, with the election interference with the ...Yeah, for sure, but without realizing that at the same time, you’re getting attacked on other fronts and losing ground on other fronts.Right. So what is the US doing? What is the US doing to this? We’re not just sitting here?No, we’re not. I mean, first it started with recognition, and speaking in terms of a shadow war, though they don’t use that exact term, is something that US military commanders do. It’s something that folks in Cyber Command do, etc. Making piecemeal decisions of consequence, but without a clearly articulated vision. And I’ll give you an example. I mean, again, we talked about this, the Trump administration enabling some offensive cyber weapons in response to intrusive attacks by Russia and China. You know, in other words, meet them out on the battlefield here. So you’ve had that happen. The US has not made a decision exactly how to respond to threats in space, although we are starting to send satellites into space that have greater maneuverability so they could get out of the way.So they’re kamikaze, they’ve got grapplers, what are we going to do?Well ...Just shoot them.You could, I mean, a couple of things you’re talking about. Sending satellites up with some shielding so that they could resist the effects of directed energy weapons. The former head of Space Command, he talks about sending satellites up with the equivalent of carrier escorts, right? So other satellites that could help push off, even lay depth charges in space terms to, you know. So you’re talking in those terms, they haven’t made the decision on offense, but they are making decisions on defense in space. In terms of tying it together and responding with a contiguous national strategy, it hasn’t been articulated yet. And one point ...Why, in any of these administrations?We don’t have leadership.Is it just this administration, or is it previous?Previous administrations didn’t recognize it sufficiently. They were at least willing to identify Russia as a threat, particularly. You can give this administration credit for identifying China as a greater threat, you know, the trade space, stolen state secrets, etc. But you need a whole-of-government response, which requires focus from the very top, articulation of a strategy from the very top. In this administration focusing on China, but still will not identify Russia as the threat that it is. You can’t have that leadership. And don’t take my word for it. The sub commanders want the leadership, the space commanders want the leadership, the folks in the NSA want the leadership.There is only partisanship. They can’t make basic decisions together. Do you imagine the political climate changing so that happens? Or is Russia, has it worked? They’ve created dissent and discord.You have to depoliticize this threat. And this threat has been supremely politicized by the president.Russia has, and China has too, I assume?Well, they have for sure. You know, Jim Clapper makes a great point in comparison. He says ...Explain who he is.Jim Clapper, former director of national intelligence, to speak to him, and again he’s been politicized as well.Yes, he has.But he’s served 50 years in intelligence and served Democrats and Republicans. He says that America does not do future threats well. He imagines this scenario where George Tenet in August of 2001 says, “We’re getting a lot of chatter about terrorists targeting aviation in the US, I’m going to require all Americans to take their shoes off and not carry liquids on planes and go through an extra level of screening.” And he said, “Americans would have said, ‘no way.’” 9/11 happens, you get woken up. The trouble is, you can argue the US did have it’s sort of Pearl Harbor, with the election interference in 2016, or should have, because that was a consequential attack on our most sacred institution. But it had been politicized by one side, by Trump. So that you can’t identify it in a unified way and therefore respond to it.So what happens?Well, without getting together and thinking about a national strategy to respond, and taking actual steps, they’re going to continue to win, right? I have a final chapter where I lay out what smart people say are a series of steps that need to be taken.All right, talk about the steps, and then talk about what winning would be for them.Okay. A good more than half a dozen of them. One, know the enemy. So get over this delusion that they want what we want. And then that’s happening now. You’ve got to defend our institutions better. That’s simple, sounds simple. Can you do it when you have a president who’s had only one cabinet-level meeting on election security? And you can’t bring it up in his presence, according to the chief of staff, because he doesn’t want to talk about it? No. You got to get over that hurdle. You have to set clear red lines about where the US will not allow Russia and China to attack, whether it’s invade a country in Europe, create territory in the South China Sea, mess with our elections, deploy space satellites. We have to set what the red lines are.Well, Jim, “he said he didn’t do it.”There you go.“I asked him, and Putin said he didn’t do it.”Can I tell you what that Helsinki moment means for the folks who are on the front lines of this? That was one that in a thousand, well not a thousand ...Worst.Dozens of interviews for this book identified it as a worst moment.Worst. I thought it was, like, are you kidding me?The worst. And again, it’s not a political point.I was thinking of all the people that do the work, I mean, it was sort of like, are you kidding me?Felt undermined and embarrassed by it. So that can’t happen. So you set the red lines, but you also have to raise ...You know what? I hope someone else went and, “Just ignore him.”Well.That’s what I’m hoping. I’m assuming that’s what happened. Even a Pence would go on and go, “Hmm.”The question becomes, who does Russia listen to? Does it listen to them? Or does it listen to the president?No, not that, but the people who are working for us. “Just ignore him.”They get those messages all the time. But Russia doesn’t ignore the president’s comments, you know, and neither does China.No, but like, “Don’t do what he said.”I hear you.You know what I mean?Yeah.I think there’s a lot of “don’t do what he said” going on.There is, there is.Well, you saw that, and just some of the Mueller report, and don’t do what he said.Exactly. Or you know, the taking memos off his desk, right?Which is terrible, which is terrible.You know, this kind of thing. So that does happen. But just on that point for a moment, Russia and China looked at the signals coming from the top when they calculate how far they can push back.Right, that’s right.So it does have consequence.No, you’re constantly having to clean up a mess.Raising the cost to a point that it changes behavior. Our favorite response is to slap sanctions on this and that, and has that ... You know, Russia’s still in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. China is still on these man-made islands in the South China Sea. Clearly, the response to 2016 interference didn’t work, because they tried again in 2018, and they’ll try again in 2020. Raise the costs with consequence. And in the book there’s a discussion of a few ways to go about it. And I mean, there are of course the idea of sector-based sanctions, right? Go after Russian oil. That has enormous economic consequences. But what about information ops of your own?Oh, we’re doing that.Well we are, but to what degree? Ash Carter brings up the idea of, what if you expose Putin for the thief that he is to his own people? Expose his financial ...They don’t care.Maybe, maybe. What if you expose...They’d clap for him.Here’s something that Carter brought up as well. What if you expose all the Russian boys that are dying in Syria? Russia lies about the Russian regulars.Well it did work in Afghanistan. Yeah, that one might work.There you go. So, some of them can be clever. You know, these are the discussions that ...I don’t know, that’s a country that feels so bad about him, so manifestly insecure as a country, you know, if countries could be people. It’s literally the most insecure country on the planet. And so they have to feel good about themselves. And so believe almost anything. I’ve been there many times and I always think this country is ... We’re crazy, but they’re crazier. But you know what I mean? Like, you can’t say that ...No, I do.You know, it’s like, wow, that’s really inaccurate. And I think at some level, even though we make fun of ourselves, I think even ... most Trump supporters do get the joke. You know what I mean? They aren’t diehards in the way that you think they are.I hear you.You know what I mean? And there, I’ve found it to be fascinating in terms of how they feel about Putin. But getting back to ... Go ahead, sorry. So go ahead.So set red lines.Set red lines. Reagan made it costly. To me, I think one of the reasons the Cold War, whatever you think of Reagan, he made it so costly. Then we put them into economic turmoil.Exactly.And we just outspent them.Yep.At cost to us, but a greater cost to them.So that’s the thing, you have to raise the cost to make a difference and change the behavior. We clearly haven’t struck on that.What was his thing? What was his thing, the space thing?SDI.Just saying that was enough.The Strategic Defense Initiative, yeah.Just saying that was like ... To me, I was like, everyone was sort of, “intelligence,” and I’m like, “No, no, that will drive them crazy.”Absolutely. So you have that. I mean, there were other, you know, strengthen alliances. This is the thing, we’re in a space where NATO has never been, not never, but it’s been a long time since NATO was as relevant as it is today, right?Absolutely.Because you need that unity to stand up to Russia. And when you have public discussion, from the president, questioning the usefulness of the unit, that makes a difference, and Russia takes those signals. So alliances matter more, not less, today. That’s of issue. The other area that there is frequent agreement on is, you need treaties for space and cyber. We don’t have treaties for them.We do not.And you need to set, you know, we ... Listen, we have negotiated treaties without enemies before. We did it during the Cold War. We got a red phone, right? So to reduce the chances of nuclear conflagration, you need something similar for space and for cyber. Difficult to sit across the table from these people. But there is mutual interest in establishing some sort of parameters around this, because everybody would suffer from a space conflict. Listen, you blow up some satellites in space, that you can’t use those orbits for years afterwards. So everybody pays. You’ve got to find a way to avoid that kind of scenario.Right, right, so mutually assured destruction. Which of the two countries do you think is most reasonable? I would think China because of their economic interest. They love their economic interest.The general view you get is that Russia is maybe the more aggressive short-term threat, but China is the much longer term, more capable existential threat over time. Just bigger economy, bigger population, greater capability, greater knowledge.Also capability of working with them, correct?Well, yes.You have things at stake. You have things at stake.You do, and I make the point, people frequently make the point, that during the Cold War we had a couple billion dollars a year of trade with the Soviet Union. Basically nothing. We’ve got $600 billion a year now. So there are mutual interests in maintaining a relationship. And actually, in the midst of this trade war we’re seeing ...So what’s the impact of this trade war now?Well, it could be pretty darn bad, right?For who?Well, for both of us. I mean, I always say to people, “Okay, you want to stop buying stuff from China. Look around your living room. How much stuff is made in China? Are you willing to pay two or three times as much for your flat screen TV, or your furniture?” It’s actually, you know, most Americans can’t afford that. You may be, but that’s a consequence of cutting off that kind of trading relationship.You could say the same about Mexico, I suppose, in a lot of circumstances. So you have the potential here of exacting punishment from both sides of it. Another one is ... You mentioned rare earths earlier, right? The US stopped mining the stuff. China is now using that as a cudgel against us, saying “we’ll stop exporting that to you” or ...Mercury. Yeah, my brother is an anesthesiologist. He’s always talking about mercury.Yeah, there you go.There’s a couple of things he talks about, anesthesia stuff, that he’s an anesthesiologist and he’s like, “We cannot get this anymore because China bought up all of it.” Or something, it was really interesting. I was like, “What?” Yeah, isn’t that incredible?I know, he’s like, “No, this is really bad. This is a bad, bad thing for my job.” And he’s a doctor. Okay, so what’s the answer to this? What should we do? All these things you’ve talked about, what’s the critically most important thing we need to watch out for? And what would, besides Trump educating himself on some of this stuff, what is ... Does it have to be from Trump, or can it be from other leaders?Well, it could be from, I mean Congress can ... You speak about it in these terms, we haven’t heard it. Military leaders, our intelligence officials are speaking about it, but they need the resources and they need to mobilize us, right? Because we have to be involved. I will say that there is a public element to this as well. I spent a lot of time in Estonia on this because I love Estonia. But here’s a little tiny country of 3 million people who’s been beaten up by Russia repeatedly, and yet they’ve stood up. They’ve stood up and the president of Estonia, who I interview, they talk a lot about cyber hygiene. I know you’ve talked about it on your broadcast that, you know, we’re only as good as our weakest link, any system, in terms of these kinds of attacks, particularly the blunt force kind of stuff. I tell the story in here about how John Podesta lost his emails ...Oh man, that was too easy.And you know, the fake Gmail.I could have hacked John Podesta.I know! The fake Gmail thing ...Everyone’s like, John Podesta probably like had a password 1-2-3-4 would be my guess.Well, he may have, but you know, the story too is he sent it to his IT person, or his assistant did, IT person recognized it as an illegitimate at Gmail password reset but autocorrected it in the email back to “legitimate.” They click on the link and the rest is history. Incredible.You know, we all have to be smarter about how we handle this kind of stuff because you know, you could get into any institution ...Oh, totally.By an easy spearphishing email.Totally. So our only response is “every man for himself?”Yes. Well, not every man, it’s just ...Or else we’re going to have submarines or kamikaze...We’re all on it. We’re all in on this.Jimmy, shh. You scare the shit out of me now.But there’s a way forward. I’m an optimist.Kamikaze, geez, now I want to ...We just have to get on top of it.Now I’m going to have to call Elon Musk up and figure out what we need to do.Exactly.Is Elon sending up something like that? Isn’t he?He may be.No he’s not, you haven’t met Elon. As we privatize space, that’s really interesting because in this country, privatization of space is what’s happening, which is bad, because then you don’t have big strategic initiatives the way they have in these other countries.Right, in terms of competition. And again, so I don’t want people not to sleep at night. You know, I do want people to think about this, because I’m concerned about it as an American. There are smart people and good Americans thinking about this and taking steps, but until we demand more from our leaders on a strategy for responding to this, and if we aren’t willing to do more ourselves, then we’re going to be the frog in the boiling water, right? That over time, you know you lost this.Jim, you’re bumming me out, Jim. We’re never going to win, are we?Well, we can stop losing, and we’re losing now.We can stop losing. Thank you, Jim, for that. You should run for office on that.Yeah, exactly. That’s quite a bumper sticker.“I’m for not losing any more. Yeah, we’re going to not lose so much that you’re going to be sick of not losing.”Exactly, exactly. That’s not the greatest hashtag.Listen, I will say one thing on the positive point, because it is more than just not losing. I’m convinced of this — and I don’t mean to wave the flag too much, but I believe it — we have much more to offer the world and Russia and China, our systems do. And this is to some degree a clash of ideas. What kind of world do you want to live in?I think we get them with the sneakers and the McDonald’s, but I thought we ruined them.And the jeans.I thought they’d be like, “Oh well.”I know, we should have.But they didn’t. It worked on France.We had more to offer. Now let’s be frank. People are not clamoring for a CCP.That’s the thing.The Chinese Communist Party. They’re not clamoring for Putin’s, you know, regime.On the other hand, they’re not clamoring for doing anything about that. The fact that people don’t care about it. I was literally at a party yesterday, and it was talking about the stolen election in Georgia, which I think, I do believe Brian Kemp played games there, and who knows if Russia was involved and stuff like that, and things like that, and literally an intelligent person at the party was like, “Oh! Who cares?”Wow.And I almost decked this man. I was like, “Who cares?” Like, “You can’t prove it.” I’m like, “Oh my God, that you’re starting from not caring is really a problem, like that you ...”I care.I do too. I do too, and I think that people do get tired of it, when Trump keeps tweeting about it and everybody gets exhausted. It’s meant to be exhausting and that’s how you win.It is, exactly. Over time you numb people.Yes, exactly. Anyway, Jim, this is a fascinating book. I urge you all to read it. It’s Jim Sciutto, he’s from CNN, but he’s more than that. He’s more than an anchorman. He’s the author of a recently released book called The Shadow War: Inside Russia’s and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America.” We shall not let them defeat us. On the beaches or in the cyberspace.

"BDS — the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel — explained",2018-05-16,Vox,['Zeeshan Aleem'],"Filed under:Israel’s violence in Gaza is giving new life to the movement.If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.With gruesome images of Israel’s lethal crackdown on Gaza spread across the world, Palestinian activists are calling for a renewed push around a hard-hitting pressure tactic against Israel: Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS). European and Arab leaders are harshly criticizing Israel for killing dozens of Palestinian protesters in Gaza. Now Palestinians and their supporters are hoping the outcry will lead to more support for their campaign to boycott Israel and turn the country into an international pariah.At issue is the pro-Palestinian BDS movement. Its supporters, who take inspiration from the campaign that international activists used to pressure South Africa to end apartheid, work to punish Israel economically and isolate it politically because of its continued occupation of the West Bank, de facto control of Gaza, and mistreatment of Palestinian citizens of Israel. BDS has had some high-profile successes in recent months, such as when the pop star Lorde canceled a concert in Tel Aviv in December in response to pressure from BDS activists.Now pro-Palestinian activists online are calling for an escalation in international BDS campaigns in response to the killings in Gaza. Mustafa Barghouti, a member of the central council of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, told BBC’s Newshour on Monday that BDS and popular nonviolent resistance are “the best two instruments to force Israel to change its policies.” BDS is highly controversial in Israel and the American Jewish community. Some of its critics describe it as anti-Semitic, arguing that it unfairly singles out Israel for human rights violations when other countries have worse records, or that it’s a crude tool that can alienate people sympathetic to its cause. Its defenders argue that since BDS arose in response to Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, its focus on Israel is logical, and that its criticism is rooted in the country’s violations of international law, not Israel’s character itself. The movement officially condemns all forms of bigotry, including anti-Semitism. Experts have estimated that BDS could lop anywhere from $15 billion to $47 billion off the Israeli economy over the next decade. That financial toll could grow if the Gaza killings lead to a spike in support for BDS efforts globally. “Every time Israel blatantly violates Palestinian rights, there is another BDS victory,” Noura Erakat, a Palestinian-American legal scholar of human rights at George Mason University, told me.The BDS movement says its goal is to push the Israeli government to meet three main demands. In its own words, these are:1. Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall. International law recognizes the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Syrian Golan Heights as occupied by Israel.2. Granting Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel their right to full equality3. Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194BDS has been around for more than a decade, and it enjoys high levels of support among Palestinians, in part because it seems to have better prospects of effecting change than the divided and anemic Palestinian political leadership. But it’s really in the past few years that it’s begun to gain international prominence, evolving from a fringe movement to one that worried Israeli and Jewish leaders are condemning more and more strongly. “Those who wear the BDS label should be treated exactly as we treat any anti-Semite or bigot. They should be exposed and condemned. The boycotters should be boycotted,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in 2014.The BDS movement has some wins on the world stage, including the European Union’s creation of guidelines that require goods exported from Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories to be labeled as such (as opposed to simply being labeled as from Israel), a policy that’s expected to hurt Israeli exports. Norway’s $810 billion Government Pension Fund Global, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, blacklisted two Israeli companies over their involvement in settlement building in East Jerusalem.  The movement’s impact in the US has been more mixed. The United Methodist Church’s $20 billion pension board, the biggest pension fund asset manager in the US, blacklisted the five largest Israeli banks. The student councils of most of the University of California campuses have voted for divestment from companies making money from the settlements, as have student organizations at New York University, George Washington University, and Barnard College.  The National Women’s Studies Association and other academic groups in the US have voted to boycott Israeli universities. In 2013, legendary physicist Stephen Hawking refused to attend a conference in Israel in solidarity with BDS.In the aftermath of the Gaza violence, the White House didn’t echo its European allies in condemning Israel or calling for an international probe; it instead put all the blame on the Palestinians.There are signs that BDS can do more damage to companies by harming their reputations than by getting large numbers of people to boycott their products.Take the Israeli company SodaStream, which manufactures a kitchen appliance for carbonating water at home. BDS supporters targeted it for operating a factory in the West Bank, and the company ultimately shut down down the facility in 2015. Its CEO, Daniel Birnbaum, said the move was a financial decision that wasn’t tied to the BDS campaign, which he said had only a “marginal” effect on its business.But according to testimony Birnbaum submitted to Congress, the BDS movement hit the company squarely in the pocketbook. “There is absolutely no doubt that our reputation as individuals and as a company was compromised because of our association with the lies and allegations directed at us from the BDS,” Birnbaum said.SodaStream’s experience gets to the heart of the matter here. While BDS’s actual financial impact on foreign and Israeli businesses in Israel so far is extremely small, its campaigns can deal a significant blow to a brand’s reputation over time. And that’s enough to change the behavior of institutions that want to maximize their bottom line.So while BDS campaigns aren’t yet close to capable of bringing Israeli businesses to their knees, in the aggregate, they could easily become a substantial factor in the calculations that investors worldwide make about Israel’s business climate. Steven M. Cohen, a research professor at Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion, told me that to the average Jew, BDS is threatening because it comes across as “anti-Israel.”Although BDS has a formal mission statement, in reality, it serves as a banner for a number of groups and individuals with a wide variety of views and motives. And the movement has attracted members who push for goals that go further than getting Israel to comply with international law.As Vox’s Zack Beauchamp has written, “While the movement takes no official position on how to end the Israel-Palestine conflict, one of its co-founders, Omar Barghouti, has called for unifying them into a single state, which would mean dissolving Israel as a Jewish state.” That’s fed concerns among some Israeli observers that the thrust of BDS is ultimately at odds with a two-state solution. “Chief spokespeople for the state of Israel argue that the Palestinians and their supporters are not looking for freedom and to live peaceably within Israel, but that they’re trying to take over all of Israel or wipe out the Jewish state,” Cohen says.BDS advocates argue that the movement doesn’t stand by any specific political future, and instead focuses on compliance with international law. Many supporters of Israel have also been dismayed by the BDS movement’s successes in, for instance, getting Lorde to cancel her planned concert in Tel Aviv amid public pressure from BDS activists and fans. “I’ve received an overwhelming number of messages and letters and have had a lot of discussions with people holding many views, and I think the right decision at this time is to cancel the show,” Lorde said in a statement. “I’m not too proud to admit I didn’t make the right call on this one. I’m truly sorry to reverse my commitment to come play for you.” After she pulled out of the concert, a prominent American rabbi, Shmuley Boteach, ran a full-page ad in the Washington Post calling her a “bigot,” while a group of more than 100 musicians, actors, and directors signed a public letter supporting her.Israel’s recent victory in the Eurovision Song Contest — its first since 1998 — caused dismay among BDS advocates, some of whom basically hoped that Israel would be barred from participating. The fact that Israel, as the defending champion, will host next year’s competition is angering them further.“Israel will use next year’s Eurovision to try to legitimize its occupation, ethnic cleansing and illegal annexation,” Ali Abunimah, founder of the website Electronic Intifada, tweeted on Sunday. Europe, he writes, is “giving this propaganda its full Trump-like support.”Sometimes specific one-off boycotts by artists have been confused with support for BDS,  — like when Israeli-American actress Natalie Portman canceled her visit to Israel to receive the Genesis Prize, a prestigious award sometimes referred to as the “Jewish Nobel,” in April.The Genesis Prize, in a statement, said that “recent events in Israel have been extremely distressing to her,” adding that “she does not feel comfortable participating in any public events in Israel.” This was widely interpreted as a reference to the crisis on the boundary between Israel and the Palestinian-populated Gaza Strip, in which Israeli troops have shot a number of Palestinians during occasionally violent demonstrations near a border fence. Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev blasted the decision, saying Portman had “fallen into the hands” of the BDS movement; Oren Hazan, a member of Israel’s parliament from the Likud Party, called for Portman’s Israeli citizenship to be stripped.But Portman soon clarified that her action was targeted at Israeli leadership, not the state of Israel as a whole. “I chose not to attend because I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu, who was to be giving a speech at the ceremony. By the same token, I am not part of the BDS movement and do not endorse it,” Portman wrote in a statement on Instagram. “Like many Israelis and Jews around the world, I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation.”Israel has a strong economy, a large part of which is driven by a booming tech sector that houses a number of premier Western tech firms. It’s difficult to see how even a massive surge in BDS campaigns could destroy that reality. And so far, BDS’s successes haven’t prevented Israel from seeing a steep increase in foreign investment in recent years.But the country’s biggest concern is similar to that of Israeli businesses being targeted by BDS — the cost to its reputation.“It’s not just an impact of dollars and cents, but it’s an impact that is psychological as well,” Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, told me in an interview in 2016. “It’s about the effect of knowing that there are costs in the form of international isolation to continuing down the road Israel is on.”Israeli leaders are deeply concerned that an uptick in successful BDS campaigns and increased enforcement of EU guidelines would isolate it in the global arena. That’s why politicians from across the political spectrum in Israel have begun to describe BDS as an existential threat in recent years, and argue that its chief goal is “delegitimization.”For both critics and supporters of the BDS movement, that level of Israeli concern may be the clearest evidence that the campaign is picking up momentum. Whether it will be able to change Israeli policy is a different question entirely.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The East Palestine, Ohio, train wreck didn’t have to be this bad",2023-02-15,Vox,['Umair Irfan'],"Filed under:The train derailment and chemical spill was the culmination of a long trend of cost-cutting in the rail industry.In the two weeks since 38 train cars carrying hazardous chemicals including vinyl chloride derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, there remain frustratingly few answers about exactly why it happened or what the long-term environmental impact will be.Right now, the town’s 4,700 residents have been told that it’s safe to return home. However, they’re still wary, reporting sightings of dead fish in streams and dead chickens in backyard coops. One resident told the Washington Post this week that the air smells like nail polish remover and burning tires. On Thursday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine issued a formal request for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to send experts to East Palestine to advise and help residents sort through their health problems in the wake of the disaster. Rail workers, government officials, and industry analysts have long warned that such disasters are an expected consequence of an industry that has aggressively cut costs, slashed its workforce, and resisted regulation for years. On Thursday, another train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed outside Detroit, Michigan. So far, there is no sign of any chemical leaks. The East Palestine rail disaster does have precedent. It’s not even the first vinyl chloride spill. In 2012, a train derailed and leaked 23,000 gallons of vinyl chloride into the creek in Paulsboro, New Jersey. The critical questions now are why this type of spill happened again and what we can do to prevent the next one. There are plenty of technologies and strategies known to improve rail safety, but rail operators say they’re costly to implement. The worry is also whether there is any long-term danger to residents after the chemical clouds drift away. Thirty-eight cars derailed in the 141-car train, stretching two miles long and operated by Norfolk Southern. Several were carrying a variety of chemicals including vinyl chloride. The toxic chemical is shipped as a chilled liquid but quickly turns into an explosive gas at normal outdoor temperatures.Two days after the accident, on February 5, Gov. DeWine warned that a catastrophic tanker failure “could cause an explosion with the potential of deadly shrapnel traveling up to a mile” as residents were told to evacuate. To avert an explosion, responders decided to vent the vinyl chloride and burn it off. It produced a towering, pewter-colored column of smoke. The fumes wafted over the town’s 4,700 residents, situated almost directly between Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Residents felt the impacts firsthand, reporting headaches and nausea.It wasn’t until February 12 that the US Environmental Protection Agency posted a list of the chemicals leaked from the train. In addition to vinyl chloride, the train leaked butyl acrylate, a chemical that can contaminate water. Of the 20 total cars carrying known hazardous material, 11 were among the derailed.The EPA this week have told residents that it’s safe to return, though the agency is still screening homes and monitoring air quality. The agency says it hasn’t detected any vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride byproducts from the spill. On February 14, state and federal officials reported that a plume of butyl acrylate did reach the Ohio River, but that it doesn’t pose a hazard to drinking water. “The spill did flow to the Ohio River, but the Ohio River is very large and it’s a water body that’s able to dilute the pollutants pretty quickly,” said Tiffani Kavalec, the water division chief for the Ohio EPA, during a press conference on Wednesday. During a press conference on Wednesday, DeWine noted that state officials were not informed ahead of time that the train was carrying hazardous chemicals. “This train apparently was not considered a high-hazardous material train, therefor the railroad was not required to notify anyone here in Ohio what was in the rail cars coming through our state,” he said. The $80 billion US freight rail industry, spanning 140,000 route miles, is the largest in the world and, according to the US Department of Transportation, the most cost-efficient, with one of the lowest accident rates. The expansive freight rail network runs through just about every part of the country, connecting coastal metropolises to small towns in the middle, hauling 28 percent of freight in the US. One of the challenges in a train disaster is that so many different actors are involved with varying degrees of responsibilities. Trains and rails are owned by private companies, which are in charge of their own maintenance and inspections. That also means that a lot of information about their operations is not public. Since rail is considered to be a vital national industry, the federal government plays major roles in regulating it.But the government’s oversight is split confusingly among several agencies: Yet when a train derails, it’s local responders who are the first to the scene. They often don’t have the training and equipment to deal with chemical spills and when derailments occur in remote areas, it can take agonizing days to get the right personnel and tools. All of this can create a lot of confusion and frustration in the wake of a train wreck, particularly if hazardous chemicals are involved.That said, the freight rail industry has improved in safety over the years. While the 1980s saw years with more than 3,000 derailments, the DOT reported 1,044 train derailments in 2022. But rail operators are also facing pressures to cut costs from investors and competition from trucking and shipping. One way railroads are saving money is by making trains longer, so fewer personnel are required per car. Between 2008 and 2019, train lengths increased by 25 percent, according to the Government Accountability Office. There are now regular trains stretching more than three miles, often driven by just two people. The Government Accountability Office noted that the Federal Railroad Administration has no limits set on train lengths. “There are fewer derailments over time,” said Steven Ditmeyer, a former head of the office of research and development at the FRA. “The accidents that do occur, because of the longer trains, tend to be bigger accidents — more cars and more potential damage.”Regulators have also found more violations of hazardous materials rules. USA Today reported that federal officials found 36 percent more violations on trains over the past five years compared to the five years prior. Another issue is that populations are growing around rail corridors. People are drawn to those regions for the same reasons that rail is there in the first place: that’s where jobs and resources are. Communities have sprung up around once-isolated sections of rail, so when a car jumps its tracks, more people are in harm’s way and many may not realize it. “They may not have been aware of that hazard and the way that hazard can affect them,” said David Bierling, a senior research scientist at Texas A&M Transportation Institute. So when a train does derail, the train itself and the response to it can quickly become a tangled mess and catch many by surprise. It’s not certain why the Norfolk Southern train derailed near East Palestine, and the NTSB investigation could take years. However, the agency said there are signs that an overheated wheel bearing played a role.“Surveillance video from a residence showed what appears to be a wheel bearing in the final stage of overheat failure moments before the derailment,” according to an NTSB statement. “The suspected overheated wheel bearing has been collected and will be examined by engineers from the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC.”There are ways to detect these problems in advance. Railroads have infrared sensors that can identify components that are starting to heat up, but these sensors can be upward of 20 miles apart while an overheated bearing can seize in two or three miles. A train conductor may not receive any warning.  According to Ditmeyer, one way to find these problems in advance is with acoustic detectors. Failing wheel bearings often start making a clicking noise, sometimes hundreds of miles before they start overheating, so acoustic detectors on tracks could buy operators a lot more lead time to address potential problems. Combined with radio tags on cars, the system can identify the exact car and axle that’s causing problems. Better brakes are another important safety measure. A new generation of electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes for trains creates redundancy in the braking system and allows trains to apply brakes to all of their cars simultaneously. That means when a conductor slams the brakes, the cars don’t all run into each other. In a report last year, the FRA said that these brakes “improve both safety and braking performance of trains” but that train companies have been reluctant to invest in them due to cost. The Obama administration created a requirement for ECP brakes at least on trains hauling flammable materials, but the Trump administration in 2018 revoked the requirement. “The Department’s analysis shows that the expected costs of requiring ECP brakes would be significantly higher than the expected benefits of the requirement,” according to a Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration statement.Going back to shorter trains could also be beneficial, according to Ditmeyer. It would reduce internal forces and stresses within trains so derailments wouldn’t be as damaging. It would also effectively increase staffing per train car.But the rail industry has been cutting its workforce for years despite turning record profits. Over the last six years, train companies cut 45,000 employees, 29 percent of their workforce. “In my view, all of this has directly contributed to where we are today — rail users experiencing serious deteriorations in rail service because, on too many parts of their networks, the railroads simply do not have a sufficient number of employees,” Martin Oberman, chair of the Surface Transportation Board, said in a statement last year. In particular, the industry has relied on a system called precision-scheduled railroading that aggressively optimizes to run as much cargo with as few workers as possible. Rail workers don’t even get paid sick days. Congress last year had to intervene to avert a rail worker strike over poor staffing and sick leave. Investor pressure to reduce spending can be more powerful than a locomotive, so it will take even stronger regulations and oversight to enact these safety measures and prevent such disasters in the future.“There are things that could be done, the problem is they cost money to implement,” said Ditmeyer. “If railroads start shortening trains, Wall Street will punish them.”Part of the problem is also psychological. Train wrecks grab a lot of attention, but it’s tough to convince local, state, and federal officials to have the resources in place before disasters unfold. “It’s really hard to maintain that focus on preparedness,” Bierling said. “We cannot and should not be complacent.”Update, February 16, 4:30 pm: This story was originally published on February 15 and has been updated to include news of Ohio seeking CDC assistance with the response to the East Palestine rail disaster.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Texas Republicans are trying to use Beto’s punk rock days against him,2018-08-29,Vox,['Tara Golshan'],"Filed under:The Texas GOP tried to make Beto O’Rourke look like a drunk punk kid. It backfired.An old mugshot and photos from the punk rocker past of Rep. Beto O’Rourke, the Texas Democrat making a long-shot bid to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), are flying around on social media — thanks to the Texas Republican Party. The official Texas GOP account began circulating a photo of 20-something O’Rourke, with a voluminous head of hair and cool-kid stare, trying to paint O’Rourke as an immature drunk and former-criminal punk rocker. O’Rourke was arrested twice, but not convicted, in his 20s; a 1995 misdemeanor arrest for jumping a fence at University of Texas at El Paso campus — filed as a burglary — and a 1998 misdemeanor drunken-driving arrest in El Paso.The excuse for the photo? O’Rourke has said a debate with Cruz this Friday isn’t happening. One tweet implied O’Rourke was too drunk to debate the sitting Republican. A second tweet asked if O’Rourke was skipping the debate for music “gig.” Another featured a recent photo with O’Rourke and a skate board. This seems to have backfired for Republicans; Twitter users focused on O’Rourke’s perceived attractiveness and fun background as a musician and skateboarder. (Some users surfaced a photo of Ted Cruz in high school, performing the Christian Creation story as a mime). The Texas GOP did not respond for comment, but they did tweet this:Resurfacing opponents’ past criminal records is low-hanging fruit in political campaigns. But in this Texas Senate race, it is indicative of an increasingly nervous Republican Party. Recent polls show O’Rourke gaining on Cruz, recent polls find — a development that has pushed the Cook Political Report to change the state’s partisan rating from “Likely Republican” to “Lean Republican.”For the first time in more than two decades, a Democrat is proving to be a formidable candidate to win a statewide race in deep-red Texas — and the Republican Party is retreating to its standard failsafe: fear.On the surface, this whole attack campaign is about scheduling a series of debates. For weeks O’Rourke and Cruz’s campaigns have been going back and forth on where and when — and in what language — the two men should debate.In April, O’Rourke’s camp offered having six debates, including two in Spanish. In July, Cruz countered, challenging the Democrat to five debates, sending proposed dates and locations. The first was scheduled to be this Friday, August 31 in Dallas. On Monday, O’Rourke said that wasn’t going to happen.So now the Texas GOP is on the attack, hitting O’Rourke for “ducking” debates that were never fully organized. Their strategy has been to highlight O’Rourke as a punk-rock skater boy with a criminal history.The tweets are meant to make O’Rourke look juvenile. But instead, for those who have been following O’Rourke’s brand, the attack strategy seems to be just feeding into the Democrat’s image; a young, bold, former punk rocker on a Hail Mary mission to turn Texas blue. “When you’re putting out your own records and booking your own tours and writing your own songs, you get to control what you say,” O’Rourke told Vox, comparing his decision not to take PAC money for his campaign to his days playing in a punk band named Foss. “The campaign is the same thing.”Texas GOP didn’t respond for comment. But it’s increasingly clear they are taking O’Rourke seriously as a Democratic challenger. The latest survey, an Emerson College online poll, found Cruz and O’Rourke in a statistical tie. The poll, conducted August 22-25, found Cruz with 38 percent of the vote, O’Rourke with 37 percent, and 21 percent of respondents undecided. It had a 4.4 percent margin of error. Several other surveys have also found O’Rourke within single digits of Cruz.Put simply: It’s becoming a very real possibility that Cruz could lose reelection to a Democrat — an upset that would seriously imperil Republicans’ hold on the Senate majority. Texas has not had a Democratic senator in more than 20 years.If O’Rourke wants voters to think anything about him, it’s that he’s an open book. He hasn’t hired a political consultant or pollster on his campaign; he live-streams almost every aspect of his life, from his kids eating breakfast to his morning runs with voters. He brags that he’s not taking any money from PACs. His campaign still raised more than $10 million in the past three months, more than double what Cruz pulled in.His first campaign ad showed O’Rourke driving through every single Texas county, and was called “Showing Up.”And he’s fine talking about his legal history; it’s not the first time his arrests have popped up in his political career. O’Rourke apologized for his run-ins with the law when he ran for El Paso City Council in 2004. The two arrests surfaced again in O’Rourke’s first congressional race in 2012, when he was challenging then-sitting Rep. Silvestre Reyes, a Democrat. Reyes ran the photo and criminal record in a TV ad that said O’Rourke “has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests.” O’Rourke has acknowledged both cases, saying that he had no justification or “excuse” for his behavior then and that he was “grateful for the second chance.”“Some 20 years ago, I was charged with driving under the influence and, during my college years, I jumped a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso which resulted in a burglary charge,” O’Rourke told a local paper, the Palestine Herald-Press, in 2017.He continued: “I was not convicted of either. Both incidents were due to poor judgement and I have no excuse for my behavior then. However, since then, I have used my opportunities to serve my community and my state. I’m grateful for the second chance and believe that we all deserve second chances.”And as for his punk-rock past: It’s informing his campaigning, he said.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Israel’s stalled West Bank annexation, explained by an expert",2020-07-13,Vox,['Jen Kirby'],"Filed under:The politics and the potential problems ahead.It took three elections, but Israel finally formed an emergency government this spring, in the middle of a pandemic and a global economic crisis.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, of the Blue and White party, averted another election, but the deal also laid out a plan for annexation of parts of the West Bank as soon as July 1. The plan has the potential to completely upend the fragile, but unsustainable, status quo in the Israeli-occupied territory. Home to nearly 3 million Palestinians, the land makes up a critical part of any future independent state of Palestine. But the viability of that future state is complicated by the presence of some 500,000 Jewish settlers who also live in the West Bank, in settlements dotted across the approximately 2,262 square miles of territory. Under the two-state framework historically supported by the United States and the international community, the vast bulk of the West Bank would be returned to the Palestinians. As part of a final peace deal, Israelis and Palestinians would negotiate what to do about the settlements, with some heavily populated blocs near Israel’s recognized borders likely to be ceded to Israel. But peace talks have stalled for years, and there is no deal anywhere on the horizon. Instead, the Israeli right has been pushing for Netanyahu’s government to just go ahead and unilaterally annex significant portions of the West Bank that it wants to keep, making them officially part of Israel proper, regardless of what the Palestinians think about it.  In January, the Trump administration unveiled its “peace plan,” developed by US and Israeli officials without the input of Palestinian leaders, who refused to participate. The plan helped create the conditions for Netanyahu to move forward with unilateral annexation, and for months, it looked as though Netanyahu was going to do it. In fact, it was supposed to officially happen as soon as July 1. But it didn’t.The United States is hesitating — and has some other things to deal with, like a raging pandemic and economic recession. Gantz, whose support Netanyahu needs to move forward, is also urging patience, suggesting Israel deal with its own growing coronavirus outbreak first. The rest of the world has also resisted the plan: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson penned an op-ed against it. Other countries, from Germany to Jordan, have condemned the move, and United Nations officials have consistently called it illegal.So the plan remains stalled, for now at least. Given all the questions swirling, I contacted Brent E. Sasley, a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington and an expert on Israeli politics, to talk about the basics: what annexation means, why all this is happening (or not happening) now, and what comes next. He offered some historical context to explain the current dynamics and the still-present uncertainty about this moment.Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.I guess an obvious place to start is: What is the West Bank? Geographically speaking, it’s literally the west bank, uncapitalized, of the Jordan River. It’s become a convenient term to use when you don’t want to refer to “Palestine” or “Israel” or “Judea and Samaria” — the latter being terms that hark back to the ancient Jewish kingdom and which the Israeli government uses formally in all of its references toward the area. For some people, it’s a nonpolitical term because it doesn’t refer to anyone’s claim to the land. But for many, many right-wing Jews, many Israelis, and many people on the right who support Israel’s occupation, they see it as a political term because it doesn’t refer to being a Jewish homeland.Typically, most Israelis don’t see it as separate territory. They’re more aware now of the separateness of the West Bank, but for a long time, even after Israel conquered it in 1967, they didn’t. They’d talk about family members living in extensive areas of Israel, but they actually meant people living in West Bank settlements. The line itself between Israel proper and the West Bank was just not something that they saw.And if that’s the Israeli perspective, how do Palestinians see it?They would call it Palestine. So when we talk about annexation of the West Bank, what does that actually mean? So that is kind of the big question. In theory, annexation can mean anything. Netanyahu has, in the past, promised that he will connect part of the West Bank [to Israel]. He’s also talked about annexing the Jordan Valley, which is a very specific part of the West Bank. For some people, we’re talking about annexation of all of Area C. After the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into areas A, B, and C. Area C has fewer Palestinians and more Jewish settlements. For some people supportive of annexation, they think that the entire area should be annexed. And the Trump plan, for example — I wouldn’t call it a peace plan — lays out specific areas. So there’s no real answer. One could argue that’s a positive thing because there’s lots of room to hash out some kind of agreement. But I actually think it’s a bad thing. First of all, the ambiguity creates space for the Israeli government under Netanyahu to get away with almost anything. Even if it does something really small and says, “We have now annexed this,” they’ve moved the goalposts and created language that actually embeds annexation into the discourse. They’ve now done something that makes it very difficult to reverse, and depending on where they do it, it might even be impossible to reverse. That now becomes the new norm. So that ambiguity, I think, is really problematic and dangerous. So since we don’t have a precise definition of annexation, it can basically be anything that Netanyahu dreams it to be? Is that fair? Yes, although I would add one more point to that. And that is — I don’t know if you’ve heard the term “creeping annexation”?I have, but maybe remind me what it means.Everything that I just said is the case, but the bigger problem is that creeping annexation has been taking place since 1967. Creeping annexation refers to the gradual process by which Israel expands its control over the West Bank. That includes a whole series of factors. Israelis build settlements in the West Bank, and then Israel has to then kind of take control of that area. But to do that, they then end up building roads and infrastructure to hook those homes up to Israel proper. And then there has to be security for those settlements, because many of the settlers work in Israel, and many Israelis go to these settlements for various reasons, whether it’s to buy wine or visit family. So you end up with this whole infrastructure there. It also refers to the application of Israeli law in the settlements and often the surrounding areas. Palestinians in the West Bank have been able to use, in a limited way, the Israeli Supreme Court to dispute, for example, the route of the security barrier that Israel built. On the one hand, that sounds good, because that means Palestinians have access to Israeli institutions, and those institutions can push the government to change its policies. But on the other hand — this gets back to that ambiguity I was talking about — that means that Israeli law is applied not just to the Israeli citizens but to non-Israeli citizens, as well. So that’s part of the overall process we’re seeing.So it’s a sort of de facto control, even if it isn’t formal annexation?I mean, de facto control over much of it. Why is talk of formal annexation happening right now?I think there’s probably a convergence of factors.First, as I said, this is a process that’s been ongoing for a long period of time. So everything that I’ve said about the ambiguity and moving the goalposts and new language — yes, that would be a major change. But in some ways, it will just be making concrete what’s already been happening for a long time. Second, of course, is Trump. In order to appease the evangelical base of his support, Trump has been pushing hard to change massive, longstanding conditions and to really adopt the right-wing Israeli positions regarding Jerusalem and sovereignty over the West Bank. The Trump plan comes out of that process, and so Israeli right-wingers see this as a moment in which conditions are ripe for them to do this. If you have the backing of the world’s most powerful country, then you do it. I think a third factor is that the political right in Israel has been dominant since the 2009 election, and there’s nothing on the horizon that suggests the Jewish left, the Zionist left, is in a position to challenge them in any serious, viable way. After these last three elections there was no clear winner, that’s true, but the political right and the center-right always [did far better in] those elections. The Jewish left did not do very well at all in comparison. And when I say Jewish left, I’m excluding the Arab political parties here, because obviously they don’t have a majority of support from the Jewish population. That support is what’s necessary in order to form the government. I’m not dismissing that community, I’m saying in terms of the political game, their ability to set the agenda is marginal. And then finally, I think, you have Netanyahu. When he first came to power — not in his first term, but around his second and maybe third term — he was a little bit more pragmatic. I think he was more open to negotiation. Around 2012-2013, there was a moment when Netanyahu had been pressured not to completely leave the West Bank but to put in place a series of concessions that really would have changed the game. But they failed to a wide degree. I think Netanyahu has since then become more and more bold in promoting the idea of Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank. And so I think he’s been around for so long, he’s got no serious challengers on the left, so it’s, “Look where I am, I might as well do this now.”So all those factors converged for annexation to start on July 1. But then that date came and went, and annexation didn’t happen. Why does the plan seem to be stalling? It got harder than Netanyahu thought it would be. The Trump administration started to waffle a little bit. Benny Gantz, his partner, was not as keen on annexation as originally thought, and the settlers were really upset that the plan at least created some sense, however temporary, of an actual Palestinian state. They were not happy with that. So you heard a lot of voices starting to oppose this when it came down to actually trying to implement it.What would you say is causing the hesitation on the part of the Trump administration?I’m not sure that the Trump administration has as much energy and time to focus on this issue. Obviously, there’s a lot of other stuff going on that’s kind of occupying the Trump administration, certainly its domestic energy. So it has kind of left foreign policy alone, except for Trump’s intermittent pronouncements on foreign affairs. I also think there was a lot of pressure brought to bear on the Trump administration, and again, that’s within this context of the administration being slightly distracted by other things.It just wasn’t going as smoothly as they seemed to have thought it would, or at least they weren’t able to push it as much as they thought they would. What we’ve also seen is that when it comes to really substantive issues, Trump likes to say things, and he will sometimes lend his support to ideas or policies that fit with his general ideas, but he doesn’t always put the whole weight of the administration behind him because that’s just how he makes policy — or more aptly, that’s how he doesn’t make policy. I think we’re probably seeing something of that here, too. And from the Israeli perspective — or maybe Netanyahu’s perspective — how nerve-racking is Trump’s waffling? Because it would seem Trump is the window of opportunity. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I imagine if Joe Biden were to win in November, the circumstances would change radically. But perhaps if annexation has already happened, there’s probably little Biden could do to reverse it. Do I have that right? How do you see it?I would say there is a lot Biden could do to reverse course, but it’s unlikely he would do it.But I wouldn’t say Trump’s waffling is “nerve-racking” for Netanyahu. I would say “frustrating.” Definitely Netanyahu and his allies see this as an opportunity. But I also think they’re aware of Trump’s mercurial nature. They know what he’s like, they’ve watched, they’ve listened to him, they’ve seen what he’s done. I don’t believe that they are expecting Trump to stand firm.Is there a world where Israel goes ahead with annexation without US support?So there’s a difference between the US not supporting it and the US opposing it. So the former?Yes, sure.Yes, there is a world in which that happens. And, again, you pointed out all these calculations that Netanyahu has to make, and I think that part of it is that he does genuinely believe that Israel has a right to this land, and he believes he has a role to play in getting Israel to that point.If the US opposes it, that’s a different issue. But if the US doesn’t say anything, he knows he’s got the support of some people in the administration, at least privately. He’s got the support of the US ambassador to Israel. For him, that might well be enough. Again, this is where the ambiguity comes in. It might not be, “We are now going to choose to occupy 50 percent of the West Bank.” It might be, “We are now formally going to annex these settlements,” or the Jordan Valley, or even some smaller step. Given this ambiguity, do we actually know how formal annexation could happen? Is it a matter of issue, like an order? Or do troops move in? Basically, how would we know that yesterday is different from today? Right, that’s a good question. I don’t know. I mean, it depends on what Netanyahu wants to do. For major decisions or changes in law, he would need the support of the Knesset [Israel’s parliament].That would mean getting the support of coalition partners like [Benny Gantz’s] Blue and White party that might not necessarily be on board with everything. Like any government, there are a number of steps that could be taken to get around the need for legislative approval. It all depends on what they want to do. I know I’m not really answering the question, but I think it depends.I want to talk a bit about the domestic politics of this. There was a sense that Netanyahu was using annexation as an election ploy in this latest election. But is the Israeli public generally supportive of the move, or is it much more divided than it appears? So as a general rule, the landscape, or the context, is that most Israeli Jews think that the West Bank is, at least in some general sense, part of Israel.Again, it goes back to 1967, when many felt Israel was threatened [by Israel’s Arab neighbors]. And then that was replaced by this miracle: Israel didn’t just win [the 1967 war], but it was a stunning victory.And all of a sudden, after 20 years, the heartland of the Jewish people and Jewish history and Jewish religious aspects, all of that now is suddenly under Israeli sovereignty, and Israelis can actually go touch the Western Wall, their closest connection to the Old Temple. Ever since then, that underlying sense of religious nationalism — because religion is part of it — really connected them to the area. So you can trace polling data over time that shows how Israeli Jews think about this.  And so, as a general rule — and polling data does bear this out — most Israeli Jews see the West Bank as part of Jewish history and heritage, part of its religious history. That’s the context. The Israel Democracy Institute has good polling data. The one that you should look at is the Israeli Voice Index [from July 2020]. It found that 25 percent of Israelis oppose any application of Israeli sovereignty to parts of Judea and Samaria [the West Bank], while 24 percent support applying Israeli sovereignty to all of it — so that’s roughly equal. 14 percent support applying sovereignty to large settlement blocks and 8 percent support applying it to the Jordan Valley. If you add all of that together, 46 percent — almost half of Israelis — support some element, some aspect, of sovereignty. That’s at the general level. But we also see specific responses often change. If you bring in scenarios, if you mention specific settlements or specific areas, it changes depending on how you ask it.So what about Netanyahu, then? Are his political fortunes now intertwined with his promise to annex the West Bank?He’s been talking in these terms for a long time now. The extent of what he’s been saying is something new, but the contents or the substance itself is not new. He’s been saying, since he ran against Shimon Peres in 1996, that he is better for Israel’s security, better for the Jews, in part, not just because he’ll protect them but because he does believe in a stronger, more sovereign Israel that includes the West Bank or parts of the West Bank. That’s kind of been his rallying cry ever since he got involved in national politics. So it’s not really new. I guess the answer is yes — but it’s not a new thing.Since Netanyahu has been in power for so long, has his rhetoric helped solidify public opinion in favor of annexation? Maybe that’s an impossible question to answer, but I’m curious how much he’s helped shape public opinion. I don’t think so. To some extent, we do know that often public opinion will follow what leaders say and do. In Israeli history specifically, we know that on big security-related issues, sometimes the public will turn around and end up supporting policies that they didn’t support before if the leaders simply implement them and then just move ahead.But again, there’s a very large constituency in Israel for holding on to the West Bank or applying Israeli sovereignty in some way. And that’s not new. The right and the center-right are dominant in Israel. There is almost no other game in town. And so people who will participate in the political arena or people who vote are aware of this.They have choices, depending on their view, but again, the bulk of their choices all support what we now call annexation to one degree or another.What’s the deal with Benny Gantz? It seems he’s stalling on annexation, too. Is he sort of the kingmaker here? Why does his support matter?I wouldn’t call him a kingmaker, but yes, his agreement is necessary. He’s a partner with Netanyahu. We call it a “unity government” — it’s technically not a unity government, but he’s supposed to be the partner, the main senior partner.Without Gantz, the government could fall or would fall. His assent or his consent is absolutely necessary for there to be any progress on annexation. Is it surprising that Gantz is dragging his feet?I don’t think we should be surprised. He’s given observers a bit of a roller coaster ride. He presented himself as an alternative to Netanyahu, although, if you look closely at a lot of his rhetoric and things he was saying, I don’t think he was as much of an alternative as many people thought he was. But he presented himself as such, and said, “We’re going to stand for all these different things, none of which could possibly include Netanyahu.” Yet in the end, he goes with Netanyahu. And he agrees to let Netanyahu be in a bit more of a senior position, with Netanyahu as prime minister for the first part of their rotation agreement. That becomes very disappointing, and it looks like he’s just saying, “Yep, I’ll just do what I need to do to stay in power.”He was never a loud supporter of annexation or anything like that. The fact that he seems to be slowing it down, I don’t think that’s surprising. What will be surprising is if he flat-out said, “No. No annexation of any kind whatsoever of any part of the West Bank.” That would be more surprising.  Is there any risk of the government collapsing over this?Netanyahu can’t really do anything without Gantz’s support. Unless Netanyahu has lined up other parties to support him that would equal 61 seats in the Knesset, he can’t go anywhere. That’s not to say Netanyahu doesn’t have options to pressure Gantz. But yes, it is a risk.The two were brought together out of sheer expediency. Even though the two parties share a lot of right-wing ideology, they’re not exactly the same. Blue and White sees itself as a vehicle for doing its own thing. Benny Gantz sees himself as prime minister material. He views Netanyahu as older, as someone who had his chance but who doesn’t have the same level of vitality anymore. The two parties have different perceptions of the future and what their roles are in them. That does create a context for decisions that might break the government apart. What I’m trying to say is there is a risk of this when it comes to annexation, but as well as on other issues.What about the Palestinian response? What is their position, and is there anything Palestinians can do? I think that the Palestinians are in an extremely weak position, and they have been for a very long time. Part of that is because of decisions that they have made over time. And part of that is because Israel has been the stronger power for a very long time. So the balance is in Israel’s favor.And no other actors — neither the Arab states nor the United Nations nor, obviously, the United States — have been willing to really push Israel as hard as they could on these issues. And you have the Palestinians, who themselves are divided, so that weakens their position. Second of all, you have Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Fatah party, the Palestine Liberation Organization [the organization formally recognized by international bodies such as the UN as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians], and the Palestinian Authority [the interim Palestinian governing body in the West Bank].Abbas has been working with Israel for a very long time on security issues, which has been to both sides’ benefit but especially to Israel. They’ve also been working together on a host of other issues related to sharing resources or economic factors. So there is this longstanding level of institutional interaction. What that has done is, in part, made the Palestinians dependent on Israel. For the Palestinians — and when I say Palestinians, I mean Fatah, the PLO, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank; Hamas [which controls the Gaza Strip] is obviously a different issue — to now pull apart, sure, they could. They could say, “Look, we’re not going to work with you on security issues.” That would be harmful to Israel and to Israelis. But it would also really hurt the Palestinians, because then Israel won’t have incentives to prop up the Palestinian Authority, which Israel depends on, but which much of the Palestinian elite does as well, the economic and political leaders, or at least the old guard among the Palestinians. The fact that Abbas has been threatening action for many, many years but never really follows through has essentially removed any credibility that his threats might be taken seriously. Again, it’s not all Abbas’s fault, and it’s not all the Palestinians’ fault — they’re just in a much weaker position and there’s no way for them to get out of that position on their own.I mean, they have been trying. They’ve been working at the international level, in international institutions, in the diplomatic and legal arenas. But there’s only so far that can go.If Israel does move for formal annexation, what might the reaction be? Is there a potential for real violence? Neri Zilber, an Israeli journalist, had a really interesting thread on Twitter in which he argued that everybody talks about how there’s going to be this eruption of violence from “the streets” or from Palestinians. Sometimes people say, “But there was no violence when Israel did this or that, like when the US moved the embassy.” And Zilber argues that the Palestinians don’t organize reaction unless there’s something really substantive and concrete. So Trump said, “Yes, the embassy is now moved.” That sounds horrific, but it didn’t really change anything on the ground. There was no need to organize any kind of violence or other kind of response.But annexation, particularly if it’s accompanied by sending settlers and troops to the West Bank or to the Jordan Valley, that would be a substantive change. And so there would probably be some kind of reaction: protests, demonstrations, maybe riots. Those are more likely under those conditions. Where do the Arab states stand on this?The last war between an Arab state and Israel was in 1973. Any war that’s taken place since then has been with what we call a “non-state actor” and Israel.  In part that’s because the Arab states have lost interest in the Israeli-Palestinian issue because there’s a whole host of other things going on. It’s been so long that the old allure of what we used to call “pan-Arabism” — confronting Israel, destroying Israel, or at least removing it from parts of the area — that just doesn’t make sense anymore. You can’t do that to Israel at this point.And the Israeli economy is quite large, and it’s pretty clear that many of the Arab economies have structural problems that they have to reform.So there’s no willpower or interest in confronting Israel anymore. That’s the general context. On something like annexation, they’re not going to launch a war against Israel, like the old paradigm of conflict used to be. It is possible they could pressure Israel through the United States, through Europe, or on their own, in the UN and other places. Has the pandemic played any role in how annexation has — or rather hasn’t — played out?I don’t think so. No, I would say no — my shortest answer. But it is possible that it could make annexation difficult to pursue if the Israeli government ends up being consumed with figuring out how to stop the spread. It’s possible that would put a brake on things.So if Israel goes ahead and annexes the West Bank, is this the official end of a two-state solution?I don’t know if you follow discussions in the American Jewish community, or if you saw that Peter Beinart, he first had a longer piece in Jewish Currents, the left-wing Jewish magazine, and he had a piece in the New York Times. He argued that it’s time to acknowledge that the two-state solution is dead — and this is before annexation has taken place.Plenty of other observers, commentators, scholars, and activists have been arguing that for many, many years. I think a lot of people are struggling with that particular question. Those who believe that Israeli sovereignty should extend to some part of the West Bank, or believe that the West Bank belongs to Israel in some way, obviously they are very constant with the idea that either there shouldn’t be a two-state solution or that the Palestinians will be happy with some percentage of the West Bank and that’s fine. They don’t need all of it. There are people who genuinely believe that the Palestinians will be satisfied with some small amount of the West Bank. For others, like the J-Street types, or what we call “liberal Zionists,” it’s a fight that’s worth continuing. The two-state solution isn’t really dead, and we really won’t know it’s dead until we know. As long as things remain ambiguous and there’s no massive physical Israeli occupation of the entire West Bank and Israel does not annex the entire area and so on, in a sense the two-state solution is still alive. But I certainly think it’s a question that we need to be asking ourselves. At what point do we say that the occupation has become permanent? Does there have to be a certain number of settlers or troops living in an area before we say, “It’s pretty clear Israel has no intention of moving to a two-state solution?” The political right, which no longer really believes in a two-state solution, is not going to get there on its own, and there’s no one on the horizon to replace them. So maybe this is the moment. And by moment, I’m not pinpointing a particular date and time, but this particular point in history, which could be 2019-2020. All that. That’s a really vague answer, but it’s a question I’m struggling with myself. I don’t have a good answer for myself, so I can’t give you one.Is there any way out of this current situation? Would it be possible to work out an agreement on the West Bank without actually addressing the question of Palestinian statehood? Or are those two so intertwined that it would be impossible? There have been plenty of plans and ideas put forward over the years, dealing with some questions now and then dealing with statehood questions later. That didn’t work. There have been other plans that say, “Let’s deal with these questions now, the final-status questions, the questions about statehood, and so on. There is a way out.”When Ehud Barak was the Israeli prime minister and participated in the discussions at Camp David and Taba at the end of the 1990s and in the 2000s, he proposed swapping land. Israel would annex part of the West Bank, and the Palestinians would get some part of Israel. Back then, it was a very small amount that the Palestinians would get, but that idea is out there. Negotiators and others have been talking about this for a long time. So that is an option. But at this point, it’s not really an option for the political right in Israel.Is there another way out? The only other two options out there are enormous pressure on Israel to at least halt the process of creeping annexation, or you get a change in domestic politics in Israel and Palestine. But again, we’re at this point for a reason. We didn’t just get to this point by some exogenous force that put us here. We got here because of all the changes and the choices people have made and the developments that have been going on in the region within each country and in the United States. So I’m really not hopeful. I’m not hopeful for a two-state solution at this point. I’m not hopeful for a peaceful solution at this point.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
2023’s best books (so far),2023-07-01,Vox,['Constance Grady'],"Filed under:From shipwrecks to hijackings to sex comedies, these are the best books of the first half of 2023.If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.The year is half over now. We’ve seen the swell of austere literary fiction in February, the first crop of lazy beach novels for summer. There have been big buzzy memoirs published, and cookbooks, and essays. Now, before the overwhelming surge of fall prestige book season, let’s stop and take stock of all the good books the year has brought us so far.As Vox’s book critic, I take a great bite out of all the books that come out every year. In the first half of the year, these have been my favorites: Brainy sex comedies. Environmentalist cookbooks. Shipwrecks and con artists and monsters and yes, why not have another look at that big buzzy memoir. Here are the 11 best books I’ve read in the first half of 2023.Big Swiss is the wittiest of this year’s novels, and the quirkiest, too. A breakout hit from Jen Beagin that inspired a bidding war for its film rights, Big Swiss concerns Greta, a medical transcriptionist. Greta is obsessed with a woman whose therapy sessions she transcribes, a mystery blonde she has dubbed Big Swiss.Big Swiss is a married gynecologist talking to a therapist because she’s never had an orgasm. She also survived a brutal assault from a man who’s about to get out of prison, but she’s not there to talk about that: “I’m not one of those trauma people.” Greta, transfixed, tracks Big Swiss down at the dog park. “You must get this a lot,” Greta says, “but would you mind taking a quick look at this thing on my labia?”Big Swiss is a romp of a book, a study of trauma that disdains the trauma plot, a sex comedy with deep layers. Beagin’s sentences are so dryly funny they’re ready to snap like crackers, but she never loses sight of the humanity of her odd, lovable characters. Also, there are miniature donkeys. Read if you dream of: the first season of Killing Eve but with more dogs, less scatological Ottessa Moshfegh, more warm-hearted Elif Batuman.My teeth gnashed unceasingly while I read The Guest, Emma Cline’s delicious follow-up to her 2016 novel The Girls. I was too tense to do anything but let them. The Guest is set in the rarified world of the Hamptons, where everything is beautiful or at the very least expensive, and none of it quite belongs to Alex, the titular guest. Alex is a sex worker whose quasi-client, quasi-boyfriend, Simon, has thrown her out of his lavish Hamptons beach house. The problem is, Simon is currently Alex’s only client; at 22, she’s finding the rest of her regulars have started to dry up. She’s in debt, and she needs him. So she decides to make her own way in the Hamptons for a week and then see if Simon softens up toward her. But in the gated communities Simon frequents, it’s not that easy to be a guest.Alex’s superpower is her ability to make herself fit in nearly anywhere. “That was the point of Alex,” Cline writes, “to offer up no friction whatsoever.” Marshaling her status as a well-dressed and pretty young white woman, she schemes her way into country clubs and house parties — until, inevitably, she pushes her luck too far and gets kicked out. With flat, understated sentences, Cline keeps us crammed and immobile in the vacant confines of Alex’s mind. In chapter after chapter, Alex first systematically empties herself of any opinions or thoughts of her own in order to become the kind of woman her marks require of her, and then impulsively lashes out and creates friction. Alex is a creature of instinct who never seems to quite understand what she’s doing, but in Cline’s precise, elegant prose, we can see how heavily Alex bears the burden of being a woman with no needs of her own. Read accompanied by: a Negroni, unsweetened black tea, very dark chocolate. Vintage Contemporaries is a thoroughly charming and warm-hearted novel by Slate book critic Dan Kois. It concerns two best friends, both living in the bohemian East Village of 1991, both named Emily. One of them is brash and bold and wants to direct plays; the other is a more conventional follower who wants to write books. Kois follows them over the course of 14 years, tracking their friendship and dreams as they evolve along with New York itself.I keep wanting to describe Vintage Contemporaries as a love letter and then changing my mind as to whom the love letter is for. For the great domestic novelist Laurie Colwin, whose influence looms large over one Emily’s career. For the East Village of the early 1990s, when artists squatted in abandoned lofts. For editing and dramaturgy as creative artforms in their own rights. For old friends who know us longer than anyone. For all of the above, and more.Read if you like: Laurie Colwin, semi-ironic viewings of Beaches, Veselka pierogies.

  Have you ever spent a long afternoon in an art museum and walked out afterward to find that the world looks different than it did when you walked in; different, and more beautiful? As though the museum has trained your eye to find beauty more efficiently. Reading Kelly Link is like that: When you close the book, the world you return to is stranger and, yes, more beautiful than the one you left behind.White Cat, Black Dog is a collection of slantwise fairy tales reimagined as short stories. Link gives you “Hansel and Gretel” with vampires and spaceships; “Tam Lin” at an English estate house; “East of the Sun, West of the Moon” on the Upper West Side. Her retellings are thoroughly modern, but she’s able to preserve the strange, shivery emotional core of the originals so that all of them take place in a world regimented by rules that no one will ever quite explain to you. Read alongside: Sondheim’s Into the Woods, Robin McKinley’s Rose Daughter, Pamela Dean’s Tam Lin.

  In 2012, Tamar Adler published An Everlasting Meal, a sort of updated take on the M.F.K. Fisher classic How to Cook a Wolf that focused on solving the environmental problem of food waste by using up all your waste ingredients. The end of every meal, Adler argued in her mannered-in-a-good-way prose, should form the beginning of the next: last night’s roast chicken and vegetables should become the bones and the peels that make today’s stock; the stock can enrich the grain bowl that tomorrow will become fried rice. This year, Adler has published The Everlasting Meal Cookbook, the how-to guide that fleshes out the theory of her last book. It takes the form of a vast index of ingredients you might have left over from some other purpose, and all the ways Adler suggests you might salvage them for a new use. You already know that overripe bananas can become banana bread, but Adler is here to tell you that green bananas can become curry or tostones, and banana peels can be dry-fried into thoran. Adler’s prose is elegant and delighted at the same time, delighted with food and thrift and her own ingenuity. She can tell you what to do with almost anything, but most compelling are her suggestions for junk food: to simmer leftover french fries with cream and garlic and mash them; to put your leftover chips and onion dip into an omelet. This is a book that fights for environmentalism with hedonism.Read if you: keep meaning to figure out how to compost, are a fan of M.F.K.

  Since the explosive just-post-Weinstein days of 2017, much ink has been spilled over the problem of separating art from artist. Little of it, though, has been particularly helpful. In Monsters, critic Claire Dederer dwells provocatively in the ambiguities of the problem: You love the art and can’t unlove it. You also can’t stop thinking about the horrible things the artist did. So then now what?Dederer starts from the ground floor, with the definitions. What does she mean by monster? What does she mean by we? What does she mean by genius? She traces the rise of the idea of the artistic genius and the remarkable liberties we grant them, and she puzzles through the problem of how audiences respond as, again and again, our geniuses misbehave.

  David Grann is the rare nonfiction writer whose tightly paced and rigorously documented history books are anticipated as though they were Stephen King novels. His 2018 book, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, was a No. 1 New York Times bestseller and adapted into a Martin Scorsese movie. His latest book, The Wager, is about a doomed 18th-century naval voyage spurred on by hubris and ending in violent disaster. If it doesn’t read quite like it’s ready to be a Scorsese flick, that’s because there’s so much there that I want it to get adapted into a prestige TV miniseries instead.The British warship the Wager sails out of London in 1740 under the absurdly named War of Jenkins’ Ear. It was a clash of colonial forces, with Spain and England grappling for control of the New World. The Wager’s mission was to make its way south, down across the hellish and near-impassible Cape Horn below the southernmost tip of South America, and then back up north to the coast of Chile. There it would capture a Spanish galleon loaded with gold.Instead, the crew of the Wager develops scurvy and typhus. The ship founders and sinks off the coast of Patagonia. Survivors languish on a desert island, starving and freezing. One of them finds and adopts a dog; the other sailors eat it. At the heart of the book is a great clash of wills. The striving and aristocratic Captain Cheap wants the crew to press on to Chile after their mission. The charismatic gunner John Bulkeley wants to return home to England. They vie against each other for control of the remaining crew, well beyond the point at which their struggle turns bloody.One of Grann’s great strengths is his ability to toggle between narrative scales. He knows the engine of the story is the fight between the personalities of Cheap and Bulkeley, and drawing from their diaries and letters, he presents each character to the reader as a fully rendered human being. He also never lets us forget that the whole disaster was sparked by imperial greed, and that the colonial striving of Britain and Spain would lead to many more disasters like it.Read accompanied by: dark red wine and a good basket of well-salted French fries.In 1970, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked a group of commercial airplanes flying in and out of Israel. They landed the planes in the Jordan desert on a makeshift runway of sand and held their hostages there, confined to the planes, for a week. Martha Hodes was one of the hostages. She was 12 years old at the time. Today, Hodes is a historian at NYU. Some years ago, she writes, she realized that she had very little memory of the experience of being hijacked. She must have been afraid and sad at the time, but when she thought of the hijacking, she felt as though it had happened to someone else. The emotion was long-buried, so that all that remained of the experience was that every time she walked into an airport, she was struck with the urge to cry.In the richly emotional and elegantly constructed My Hijacking, Hodes puts her historian’s training to use to reconstruct the events of the hijacking. She aims to get a greater sense of what she lived through 50 years ago, and see if by doing so, she can reconnect to all the emotions her childhood self tamped down. With novel-like pacing and incredible psychological complexity, My Hijacking is an unflinching search for all the bad feelings we’d prefer not to look at.Read alongside: Yezid Sayigh’s Armed Struggle and the Search for State: The Palestinian National Movement, 1949-1993NPR host Elise Hu moved to South Korea in 2015 to establish a new bureau for NPR.

It has by far the most plastic surgeons per capita of any country in the world.

Instead, Hu tracks the social, political, and economic results of a beauty industry big enough to reshape a country. Her ability to lay out a highly rigid and codified standard of beauty in a different culture defamiliarizes our own enough to make its outlines and paradoxes plain.Read if you dream of: someone finally sitting you down and explaining exactly how Instagram Face became a thing.Spare is a book that defies killjoy distinctions like “good” and “bad,” “petty” and “open-minded.” Prince Harry suffers, he settles scores, he walks you through the process of applying his mother’s lip balm to his arctic-wind-chapped penis.

The Israeli-Palestinian peace process is dead. An expert explains why.,2019-04-15,Vox,['Alexia Underwood'],"Filed under:“If your solution does not include self-determination for everyone, and basic civil, human, and political rights for everyone — it’s not a real process.”One big question that’s bound to come up in the 2020 presidential election is where do the candidates stand on Israel? It’s an issue that some say is already threatening to split apart the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process — which the US attempted to broker for decades — has basically disappeared from view. Though President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner is working on a peace plan, there’s been almost zero Palestinian input. And Israel’s recent election, which will almost certainly allow right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to maintain his grip on power after he promised to extend sovereignty over large portions of the West Bank, does not bode well for any future vision of peace that includes an independent Palestinian state. For these reasons and others, there’s a good chance that Kushner’s plan will be dead on arrival. America’s consistent attempts and failures to broker peace are striking — and a new book by Middle East scholar Khaled Elgindy argues that it’s due to a particular “blind spot” the US has toward the Palestinians.Elgindy served as an adviser to the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank on peace negotiations in the 2000s and is currently a fellow in the Middle East center at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, DC.I reached out to him to talk about why the US has failed to broker peace, what role Trump has played in all of this, and how the issue of Israel and the Palestinians will continue to reverberate in the runup to the 2020 election.A transcript of our conversation, edited for clarity and length, is below.So let’s start by talking about the US’s “blind spot,” which is the title of your book. Explain what that means.The blind spot refers to two areas of diplomacy that American policymakers traditionally have tended to downplay or ignore altogether: Israeli power and Palestinian politics. The United States has the tendency to treat the two parties as though they were somehow co-equal in power, when in reality, one party is occupying the other. Israel is an occupying power. So it’s not only a conflict, it’s also an occupation. We’ve seen various moments in history where that plays out very dramatically. For example, when the Israeli army was besieging Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s compound during the second intifada [Palestinian uprising] in 2002, that’s not something that you would see in other contexts. In the negotiations between Egypt and Israel in the 1970s leading up to the 1979 Peace Treaty between the two countries, Israeli tanks didn’t surround Egyptian President Anwar Sadat’s headquarters, right? However, the United States tends to treat the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations like it did with those negotiations between Egypt and Israel, or the Northern Ireland negotiations: If we can just get the two leaders in the room to sit around the negotiating table, they can decide on the difficult compromises. The other side, the flip side of this blind spot, is Palestinian politics.American politicians instinctively understand that when you’re negotiating [with a foreign power], you’re not only negotiating with the person in front of you; you’re negotiating with their political opposition, with their public opinion, and so on. Americans understand that there are certain things you can push the Israelis to do and not do because of their own domestic political pressures. But when it comes to the Palestinians, the tendency is to treat them as if they don’t have politics, as if they don’t have a political opposition that they have to answer to, or a public opinion. It’s not only that they don’t understand the nuances of Palestinian politics. It’s that they treat them as though they don’t have politics at all.So it’s this sort of twin blind spot — where the Americans downplay Israeli power, especially its ability to dictate realities on the ground, and also neglect of Palestinian politics — that has hampered the US ability to act as an effective broker.But to add to this, America’s role in the peace process wasn’t only ineffective, it actually made things worse because it exaggerated that already significant power imbalance. And where are we today?We’ve got a triumphant Israeli government saying, essentially, we won. The settler project is a huge success. And on the other side is this broken, dysfunctional, divided Palestinian leadership that is barely capable of governing the few cantons under its jurisdiction: the West Bank and Gaza. It’s a very dysfunctional reality.So what’s happened, then, under the Trump administration? Have they made things worse?You know, in some ways they’ve made things worse, but in some ways I would argue they’ve actually helped clarify certain things. There are a couple of different ways to look at the Trump administration. You could say, “Well they’ve adopted a radically different approach.” It’s not at all clear that they actually support a real two-state solution. They’ve essentially thrown out the old peace process. That’s one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is, “Well, this administration is basically doing, in a very extreme form, what its predecessors had already started doing.” They just took it to its most extreme conclusion. So take, for example, UN Resolution 242, which has been the basic guidepost for the peace process for more than 50 years. It’s based on the principle of land for peace: that Israel would withdraw from land that it occupied in the 1967 war, in exchange for peace and recognition and normalization with the Arabs.That was the formula that was used in 1979 with Egypt. And Egypt got the Sinai Peninsula back [which Israel had captured in the 1967 war]. That was the formula in the negotiations in 2000 between Israel and Syria. And that was also the basis for the Oslo Accords [the set of agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1993 and 1995 that kicked off the “Oslo process” — negotiations aimed at getting a peace treaty between the two sides]. US policy was always to frown on Israeli settlements because Israeli settlements directly interfere in that land-for-peace formula. How can you give up land if you’re eating the pie as you negotiate, right? You’re negotiating over how to divvy up the pie, but one side is consuming it.But though the official position was “settlements are bad,” every US president since the Oslo process began basically carving out loopholes for Israel. They would say, “Yeah, settlements are bad. Israel shouldn’t do it, but I know how important Jerusalem is to you, so go ahead and build in East Jerusalem even though that’s technically still occupied territory. We’re going to treat East Jerusalem different than the rest of the West Bank.” And then other administrations came in and said, “Well, you know these settlement blocks [in the West Bank] are probably going to be part of Israel anyway, so go ahead and build there too.” So what ends up happening, then, is that those exceptions become the rule. You’ve gone from something like 270,000 Israeli settlers [in the West Bank and East Jerusalem] in 1993 to now more than double that, around 630,000. We didn’t get here by accident. We got here because of all those loopholes and allowances and exemptions that were carved out for Israel, because the US and Israel have that “special relationship,” and because the US wanted to accommodate Israeli politics, and imposing a settlement freeze is too hard for an Israeli prime minister to justify to their cabinet or to their political opponents. So we’re always willing to compromise on these basic rules of the peace process. But in doing that, the consequences are that the settlement enterprise thrived. And they now feel that they are victorious. And land for peace is basically dead.The word I use in the book for that contradictory position is “ambivalence.” It’s not a very sexy word, but it shows how the US has one position yet holds the opposite position at the same time.When President Barack Obama came in, I think he recognized the dangers of that ambivalence — that if you’re going to take a position on something, you ought to mean it. Obama said, “I want to stop the settlements. Not some settlements, not just small settlements. All settlements.” He tried to go back to the original peace process. The basic ground rules. But he didn’t put any teeth into it. He wasn’t prepared to impose any consequences on Israel for not being up to those standards.So then here comes Trump, and he says, “You know what? I have a different way of resolving this basic contradiction, which is to simply normalize the new reality on the ground — the old rules don’t really apply anymore because there are these realities on the ground, and that’s the new basis for a peace process going forward.”The problem with that view is that it’s totally arbitrary. It’s one that is dictated by power. That Israel essentially takes what it wants and we, the United States, will endorse that, and whatever is left over can go to the Palestinians.If, say, Hillary Clinton had won and she was president and was inclined to start a peace process, it would have looked a lot like the Obama peace process. It may have also looked a lot like Bill Clinton’s peace process, where they sort of blur the lines, and fudge the issues, and go through the process for its own sake. You create the illusion of a process even though nobody thinks it’s going anywhere.I think Trump is the blind spot in its most extreme manifestation. He’s almost a caricature of the blind spot. But by taking things to their absurd extreme, he’s created a clarifying moment for people, so a lot of Democrats are now like, “Oh, my god. This is not acceptable.” Maybe there are even some Republicans out there who are uncomfortable with these new dynamics. So you’re saying that Trump has done away with the illusion.Yes, he’s done away with the pretense and the illusion and all of that. Now we’re facing this stark choice: Are we supporting a two-state solution or we supporting a binational, one-state solution? Or are we getting behind what is effectively an apartheid reality on the ground? By unblurring the lines, he’s kind of put those options in stark focus.Let’s talk for a moment about his administration’s Middle East peace proposal, the so-called “deal of the century” that Jared Kushner has been working on. Many people think it’s going to be dead upon arrival. But what would it need to actually have a chance of success?Let me answer that question in a slightly different way. There’s basically a litmus test that you can apply to see whether this is a serious thing. First is does it call for an end to Israeli occupation? Does it actually say “end to occupation,” the way every president before Trump has? Second, does it refer to UN Resolution 242? Again, this is the basic, big ground rule of the peace process. And third, does it call for the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state?If it doesn’t meet all three of those standards, then we’re not even at the most minimal requirements of a pretend peace process. Then we have to broaden the criteria. If we’re not talking about a two-state solution, what are we talking about? Does whatever you’re calling for allow for self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians? Or does it simply repackage the subjugation of one group over another one? If your solution does not include self-determination for everyone, and basic civil, human, and political rights for everyone, then it’s not a real process. Any plan that is based on or implies the continued subjugation of one group over the other is just repackaging the conflict and perpetuating it.Okay. I think we can say based on what we know that this plan doesn’t meet those requirements. So what comes next? What’s the next effective step that Palestinians and Israelis can take?I don’t see a diplomatic process on the horizon. It’s possible that one could emerge at a later stage, but currently there’s no replacement to either an old Oslo process or to the United States as the chief mediator. And so we’ve got a bit of a vacuum there. But we also have a dysfunctional reality on the ground.I think if the Palestinians, especially as the weakened party, are going to change their circumstances, it’s not going to come from the United States. It’s not going to come from the Israelis. It’s probably not going to come from the United Nations. It’s going to have to start with themselves first.Right now the only party that really wants to radically alter the status quo is the Palestinians, and I think the first step to doing that is going to have to be to fix their own house, to put their political house in order. Ending the division between the West Bank and Gaza and the political split between Hamas [the Palestinian organization that rules Gaza] and Fatah [the Palestinian organization that runs the government in the West Bank] is the first step, but it’s also kind of a necessary but insufficient condition. That’s only the beginning. Then the Palestinians have to decide what is the future of these institutions. The Palestinians need a new kind of constitutional moment, a new consensus-building process that will redefine the Palestinian national movement, its priorities, its institutions, its strategy, because clearly all the old ones are either broken or failed or have disappeared.I think it’s really important for them to start thinking about these issues — not just reconciliation, but also what happens after.Given all this, I’m curious to hear what you think about how the conversation around Israel and the Palestinians is shifting in the US. Some people on the progressive left seem more willing to talk about the Palestinians’ situation. Do you think this is something that’s going to come up in the 2020 election?Yeah, I think it is going to be a factor, because if nothing else, the Republicans will make it a factor. We’ve already seen how. We have this emerging division inside Democratic ranks, within the party, that the Republicans are very keen on exploiting. We saw that with the anti-BDS [Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions] legislation, which they immediately tabled as soon as the government shutdown ended. I know a lot of folks in the Democratic establishment are nervous. They would rather not be divided on any particular issues, because they need a united front to be able to defeat Trump and all that. And I think the impulse of most of the campaigns will be to avoid this issue as much as they can. But I think it will be very hard to avoid for two reasons: One, the Republicans will make it an issue, to put Democrats on the spot. And two, because there is now a very mobilized political constituency that cares about the issue and has a different view from either the Republican or the Democratic party establishment. And they are becoming increasingly restive. They want to be vocal on this issue.I think the progressive grassroots want to make it kind of a litmus test for Democratic candidates, because they see this is part of intersectional relationships with other issues, like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, and non-intervention in general in places like Venezuela. They see this as part and parcel of this kind of ideological approach. And they’re going to make it an issue. So it’s going to come from both sides. It’s going to come from the progressive grassroots, and it’s going to come from the Republican establishment. One thing I’ve heard from more than one Democratic campaign is that, for the most part, they don’t expect foreign policy to be an issue in 2020, except on this issue of Israel and the Palestinians. They’re anticipating that it will come up.Which 2020 candidate who has announced so far do you think seems to have the best handle on this issue — meaning, who’s the least likely to have the “blind spot” that you mention?So far, the person who has the most clearly articulated view on this issue has to be Bernie Sanders. Since 2016, he’s been articulating a series of positions on Israel-Palestine. He’s not just responding. You know, a lot of times campaigns or candidates will have to stake out a position because they’re asked, “Well, where do you stand on this?” — on the US decision to move their embassy to Jerusalem, or the Iran deal, or whatever. I think most of the other candidates are probably still a little bit gun-shy; none of them have, to my knowledge, anything like Sanders’s fleshed-out set of positions on this issue. I think what we’ve mostly heard is falling back on “We want a two-state solution to the conflict,” etc. But I don’t think they’ve really been pressed on it.But Sanders has staked out, proactively, a fairly coherent set of policies, and what was pretty remarkable was that he did it in 2016, in Brooklyn, when he went into the debate with Hillary Clinton. I think he recognized that this is no longer a political liability — and that there’s actually a political benefit that can be gained from taking on this issue.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."

"The Gaza Strip blockade, explained",2023-11-01,Vox,['Rajaa Elidrissi'],"Filed under:Why Palestinians in Gaza have suffered for decades.   On October 7, Hamas, a militant group based in the Gaza Strip, launched a deadly attack on Israel, killing more than 1,400 Israelis and kidnapping more than 200. In retaliation, Israeli airstrikes had killed more than 7,000 Palestinians when this video was published on October 27, and thousands more have been killed since in Gaza, where Palestinians have lived for decades under an occupation and blockade. Since 1967, Israel has imposed tight restrictions on travel and essential goods such as food, fuel, medicine, and water in its occupied territories. In 2007, those restrictions became even tighter in Gaza after Hamas seized power there. Since then, it has been nearly impossible for Palestinians to leave Gaza or to access an adequate supply of essential goods.Today, the Gaza Strip, with a population of over 2 million Palestinians, is a victim of what many call “collective punishment” as Israel bombards its population, shuts off access to the internet, power, food, water, and medicine, forces them to leave their homes, and prepares for a ground invasion.This latest episode of Vox Atlas explains how the experience of Palestinians in Gaza got to this point, and what’s behind Israel’s occupation and its blockade of Gaza.

"British protesters want Green Day’s ""American Idiot"" to top the charts for Trump’s visit",2018-07-10,Vox,['Madeleine Ngo'],"Filed under:Over 100,000 British people are expected to protest Trump’s upcoming visit Thursday.Brits have invented a unique way to troll US President Donald Trump ahead of his upcoming UK visit — and it involves a Green Day song from 2004.Protesters who oppose Trump and his policies started a campaign to get people in the UK to buy and stream the Green Day song “American Idiot,” so that when Trump lands on Thursday, the song will be at the top of the music charts. It seems to be working: The single is already No. 1 on Amazon UK’s bestseller list, and as of Tuesday, it’s climbed to No. 18 on the UK’s official charts.Campaign organizers Keith Curle and Geoff Thomas urged people to listen to the song as many times as possible between July 6 and July 12, the day Trump is slated to arrive in the UK for a four-day visit; it will be his first official visit there since his presidential inauguration in January 2017. Trump plans to meet with Prime Minister Theresa May in Chequers and travel to Windsor Castle to meet Queen Elizabeth II, among other things.This particular official visit is a long time in coming. Back in January 2017, May visited the White House and invited Trump to Britain for a state visit, but that prompted backlash from British citizens who disagreed with Trump’s policies. UK residents promised to greet the president with waves of protests, and if all indications are correct, they’ll stick to their word.In addition to making the song “American Idiot” rise in the UK’s charts, British citizens crowdsourced over $23,000 to buy a plump orange balloon that resembles an angry baby Trump wearing a diaper. Although London Mayor Sadiq Khan originally banned the balloon from flying over the city, after an online petition garnered over 10,000 signatures, he decided to allow it.While the baby Trump balloon floats over the London skyline, local police are also expecting over 100,000 demonstrators to take to the streets, according to the New York Times.Trump’s current itinerary largely avoids London, but the Times reports that protesters still plan on disrupting his visit by creating a “wall of sound” outside of Winfield House, the American ambassador’s official residence in London, where Trump will be staying his first night. Protesters reportedly plan on playing mariachi music and the sounds of crying children asking for their parents. The British really don’t like Trump for a lot of reasons — including his contentious travel ban that affects several Muslim-majority countries, and for retweeting anti-Muslim videos from a British far-right political group.“We feel that Donald Trump’s presidency is led by Islamophobic hatred, it’s led by his anti-Palestine policies and that obviously affects Muslim communities not just in America and the Middle East, but around the world,” Shamiul Joarder, head of public affairs at pro-Palestinian group Friends of Al Aqsa told Al Jazeera. After a bombing in London that left at least 22 people injured last September, Trump used the attack to justify his travel ban in a string of tweets. Rather than an expression of condolence, Trump tweeted, “Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.” And in a later tweet, he wrote, “The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific.” His comments angered several British leaders at the time.For Americans in the UK during Trump’s visit, the US embassy in London has some advice: You should probably stay far away.In a statement on its website Tuesday, the embassy warned that Americans should “keep a low profile” and be cautious in case protests turn “violent.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The boycott movement against Israel, explained",2023-10-28,Vox,['Whizy Kim'],"Filed under:McDonald’s and Starbucks are among the targets of the nonviolent, but controversial, global protest. An unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas this month and the resulting escalating siege of Gaza has thrust the movement to boycott, divest from, and sanction Israel, called BDS for short, into the spotlight again, as some wonder what they might be able to do to encourage a ceasefire and help Palestinians facing a looming ground invasion of the crowded Gaza Strip.Just last year, a Pew survey found that some 84 percent of Americans had little to no awareness of the roughly two-decade-old campaign. Now, on social media sites such as X (formerly Twitter) and Tiktok, using the hashtag #BDSMovement, people are naming brands with ties to Israel and calling for boycotts: McDonald’s is being targeted after a location in Israel offered free food for the Israeli military, as are other global fast food chains such as Domino’s Pizza and Burger King. Some are boycotting Starbucks after the company sued its labor union this month over a union social media account posting support for Palestinians. Meanwhile, demonstrations organized by local BDS-affiliated groups are taking place around the world.  The renewed attention on BDS comes at a pivotal time for American public sentiment on Israel and Palestine. Here’s what to know about the controversial boycott.At its simplest, BDS is a global nonviolent protest movement. It attempts to use economic and cultural boycotts against Israel, financial divestment from the state, and government sanctions to pressure Israel’s government to abide by international law and end its controversial policies toward Palestinians — policies now described by some human rights experts and legal scholars as apartheid.BDS is a tactic, not an organization, so disparate groups take up their own campaigns that may focus on a slightly different set of targets, though all share a moral grounding and tactics of peaceful resistance. BDS takes direct inspiration from the South African anti-apartheid fight and the US civil rights movement, both of which effectively used boycotts. South African anti-apartheid activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a spirited defender of the BDS movement, calling the parallels between apartheid South Africa and Israel “painfully stark.”Part of BDS’s directive is to shake up Western support of the Israeli government. It advocates for a “narrative shift on the question of Palestine, that would focus on the rights of Palestinians, a spokesperson for the BDS National Committee, which represents the group of Palestinian civil society groups that founded BDS, tells Vox.The first international call to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel came in 2005 from that vast coalition of groups. At the time, more than 4 million Palestinian refugees had been displaced since the creation of the Israeli state, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Just a year before, the International Court of Justice wrote in an advisory opinion that the separation wall Israel built along Palestine’s West Bank — where illegal Israeli settlements continue to spread today — was a violation of international law.“Trade unions, farmers unions, students and academics, artists, climate justice groups, Indigenous justice networks, LGBTQ+ activists, and many more groups have taken up the [BDS] cause,” the national committee spokesperson tells Vox. The BDS homepage identifies seven US advocacy groups aligned with BDS, including the Jewish Voice for Peace, Democratic Socialists of America, and the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights. Public figures who have expressed support for BDS include Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), musician Lauryn Hill, and writers Sally Rooney, Naomi Klein, and Arundhati Roy.What unites these groups and individuals are three core demands: that Israel end its occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem; give full rights to the Palestinian citizens of Israel; and allow Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. BDS’s approach ramps up from personal actions, like boycotting certain goods and companies, to global action calling on governments to impose sanctions and embargoes against Israel.BDS’s boycotts have included not just Israeli products and companies, such as SodaStream, but also non-Israeli corporate giants the movement believes are complicit in the oppression of Palestinians. Different BDS groups around the world may list different companies and goods to boycott, but the BDS National Committee focuses on a few strategic targets at a time. Right now, it’s highlighting Hewlett Packard, an American company worth more than $25 billion that’s most known for its line of printers, because it argues that HP’s tech has aided the Israeli state in surveilling and restricting movement of Palestinians by implementing a biometric ID system. (In response, HP released a statement that it does “not take sides in political disputes between countries or regions” and that it “implements rigorous policies to respect human rights.”)The BDS campaign has in the past persuaded several high-profile companies — perhaps most famously ice cream maker Ben & Jerry’s, but also French telecom company Orange — to stop selling in occupied Palestinian territories and, in the case of Orange, end its business partnership with Israel altogether. SodaStream, facing continued pressure from BDS and accusations of mistreating its Palestinian employees, closed its West Bank factory in 2014. Some BDS participants also boycott MoroccanOil, whose beauty products are manufactured in Israel.Boycotts against Israel dig deeper than merely examining what consumers buy at the store. BDS asks supporters to abstain from Israeli cultural institutions, and even to refrain from working with Israeli universities and academics that it alleges help prop up dehumanizing narratives about Palestinians and the occupied territories. One oft-used BDS strategy is urging musicians, artists, and other celebrities not to visit Israel. Earlier this year, British singer Sam Smith canceled a show in Israel after BDS pushback. Other artists who have canceled or postponed performances in Israel include Elvis Costello in 2010, Lauryn Hill in 2015, and Lana Del Rey in 2018. Also in 2018, Lorde canceled a performance in Tel Aviv after activists called on her to join the boycott of Israel.  (Eurovision, the multi-country singing competition, was a boycott target in 2019, the year Israel hosted. The event took place as planned.) In 2017, Seattle Seahawks player Michael Bennett pulled out of a trip sponsored by the Israeli government, citing Muhammad Ali as a role model who “stood strongly with the Palestinian people.”The call to divest pressures companies to refuse to do business with Israeli companies firms, for investors to withhold their capital, and for banks and pension funds not to use customer money to invest in the Israeli economy. In the past, BDS has successfully pushed government pension funds in Luxembourg, New Zealand, and Norway to divest from Israel.The “S” in BDS calls for sanctions against Israel, which include an embargo on providing weapons and military aid, and also a cessation of trade and diplomacy with Israel. BDS advocates say this is a crucial moment to apply pressure on political leaders — especially the US government. “It’s our tax dollars and our US weapons,” says Ahmad Abuznaid, the executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, a US advocacy group that has joined the BDS movement. The US has sent $158 billion in aid to date, according to a Congressional Research Service report, and the Biden administration recently proposed a $106 billion foreign aid package that would include $14 billion for Israel. Meanwhile, the White House has resisted urging a ceasefire. Recently, the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a “humanitarian pause” in Gaza.It’s unclear how much impact BDS has on the Israeli economy. A 2015 report from the global policy think tank Rand Corporation estimated that Israel’s gross domestic product would lose about $15 billion due to nonviolent Palestinian resistance, which includes BDS — but that’s still a tiny portion of Israel’s present-day GDP of over $500 billion. Bloomberg recently reported that foreign investment in Israel had fallen considerably in 2023, likely impacted by political and social turmoil in the country; the judicial overhaul supported by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s increasingly hardline, right-wing government led to mass protests from Israeli citizens earlier this year.BDS has faced a deluge of criticism. One common argument against it, for example, is that it hurts Palestinians more than it aids them by further reducing jobs and other economic opportunities; similar arguments were deployed against boycotts and sanctions of apartheid South Africa.Most of the criticism, however, centers on casting BDS as a vicious stripe of antisemitism. This argument connects condemnation of the policies of the Israeli state with hatred of Jewish people, despite the fact that many Jewish people and Jewish groups have denounced the government — particularly Netanyahu — and lifted up the cause of Palestinian rights. Some BDS opponents argue that the movement calls for the de facto destruction of a Jewish state; the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights advocacy group, claims that BDS tries to “end the right to Jewish national self-determination on any portion of this contested land.” Others contend that BDS is antisemitic because it singles out Israel when other governments are worthy of similar human rights scrutiny; they say it expects Jewish people to adhere to a higher standard than other groups. (This, again, is similar to an argument lobbed at boycotts against South Africa.)The Israeli government, for its part, has tried to crack down on BDS efforts since their inception. In 2017, it passed a law banning people who support boycotts of the country from entering Israel. In 2019, the pro-Israel nonprofit Jewish National Fund filed a lawsuit against the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights using the Anti-Terrorism Act, a federal law under which victims can receive damages from groups found to have aided or abetted terrorism. It painted BDS participants as material supporters of terrorism led primarily by Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2021, but such accusations of terrorism are “routinely the first question that’s asked upon Palestinians,” says Abuznaid.In the US, 38 states have passed some kind of anti-BDS law, according to civil rights group Palestine Legal. In many jurisdictions, that means government contractors must sign a statement affirming that they don’t participate in boycott or divestment actions against Israel; such laws generally don’t affect individuals, though some could be used against independent contractors who support BDS in a personal capacity. Other states blacklist companies supporting BDS from receiving government contracts, or bar public pension programs from investing in BDS-aligned companies.Some states have passed resolutions denouncing BDS for promoting antisemitism, claiming it inhibits peace in the Middle East or that it threatens the relationship between the US and a key ally. In a vociferous 2016 Washington Post op-ed, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo explained his signing of an anti-BDS executive order, writing, “New York stands with Israel because we are Israel and Israel is us.” Several states have divested from doing business with Ben & Jerry’s and its parent company Unilever for its participation in BDS.Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, tells Vox that many of these state laws have been or are being challenged in court. “They have been struck down in many cases,” he says. “In other cases, litigation has caused the laws to be more narrowly defined.”In 2017, 43 US senators proposed a bill backed by the lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee criminalizing support of BDS by up to 20 years in prison. In 2019, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced a bill that would make it safer for states to impose their own anti-BDS laws. Neither made it through Congress, but Rubio reintroduced his failed bill earlier this year. These efforts have had at least some chilling effect. Airbnb, for example, backtracked on its decision to remove listings in Israeli settlements in the West Bank after an Israeli class action lawsuit demanded compensation for the hosts whose listings had been removed.At this very moment, Abuznaid says, the most urgent action isn’t a boycott — it’s to demand a ceasefire. About two-thirds of US voters now appear to be in favor of a ceasefire and de-escalation in Gaza, according to a recent poll of about 1,300 likely voters from left-wing think tank Data for Progress. Both Shakir and Abuznaid believe that more Americans are starting to question their government’s role in Palestinian oppression. While the majority, according to recent polls, still support Israel more than they do Palestine, a recent CBS News poll showed that fewer than half of respondents wanted to send weapons and supplies to Israel. “They may not understand what BDS means,” says Shakir, “but they may be supportive, for example, of not having their tax dollars going toward funding weapons to the Israeli army.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The 3 big questions facing Israel after Netanyahu delays judicial overhaul,2023-03-28,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Netanyahu paused the judicial overhaul. Hard questions about Israel remain.Benjamin Netanyahu has taken such extreme measures as prime minister of Israel that he is undermining the myths that have shielded Israel for generations. It’s more difficult than ever to argue that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East and that its relationship with the US is unwavering, as he pursues illiberal legislation that would eliminate the independence of the judiciary.Scholars and human rights experts have long probed the health of rule of law and civil rights in the country. Now, Netanyahu has advanced a radical judicial overhaul that would turn the country into unchecked majoritarian rule. As the Israeli parliament or Knesset was due to vote on the changes to the courts, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke out against Netanyahu. Hundreds of thousands of protesters had already been demonstrating weekly against Netanyahu and his far-right coalition. After Netanyahu fired the defense minister on Sunday, more than 600,000 Israelis turned out in the streets. They effectively shut down the country on Monday, and led Netanyahu to postpone voting on the judicial overhaul package till after the Knesset’s holiday for Passover.

  The movement is changing the discourse around Israel. Vocal criticism of Israel has been a third rail of American politics, but earlier this month 16 Jewish members of Congress wrote an open letter raising their fears about the overhaul. The Biden administration has been slow to clearly articulate how dire the situation has become, but a former Israel prime minister told me that President Joe Biden must step up. Whether or not Netanyahu moves forward with the vote, whether or not his coalition fractures, his aggressive actions have already exposed three core questions about Israel’s democracy, its security, and its relationship with Jews in the American diaspora. Israel has often told the world that it’s the “only democracy in the Middle East.” But it has never been much of a democracy for Palestinians, whether citizens of Israel, residents, or those living under occupation. Palestinian citizens of Israel have faced systematic discrimination from the state, and new laws in recent years — and in recent months — have made it worse for them. Israel has often been called a state that’s both Jewish and a democracy. In reality, it is increasingly a Jewish democracy. And only now that it may no longer be a democracy for Israelis has so much of the country organized.“I do not refer to Israel as a democracy even before the judicial overhaul … because of its long-perpetuated occupation of millions of people who are not involved in any of the processes that govern their lives,” said Michael Sfard, a leading Israeli human rights lawyer. For all of Netanyahu’s illiberal moves, however, some say the vibrant pushback shows the vitality of the country’s institutions. My colleague Zack Beauchamp emphasizes that the occupation and Netanyahu’s own brazenness has corrupted the country’s governance. He argues that the mass mobilization across Israel shows the strength of Israeli democracy in the face of existential challenges. But, as he notes, even if the Israeli protests are successful, issues will remain.

  Importantly, the occupation of the West Bank is likely to continue. Palestinians living there will have no voting rights, no citizenship, no say in how they live. The protests will not lead to democracy for all people in Israel and Palestine. Some protesters — like a group at Hebrew University who were chanting “Democracy for everyone, from the river to sea” earlier this month — might recognize the deeper issues with the country’s governance. But that does not appear to be a universal position among the movement.And Netanyahu’s response to the protests hasn’t been promising. Monday, as part of Netanyahu’s new arrangement to push off voting on the judicial overhaul, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was promised authority over a new national guard. Ben Gvir is a serial inciter of Palestinians who, according to the magazine Jewish Currents, “has been indicted 53 times, seven of which ended in convictions, including once for supporting a terrorist organization.” And now Ben Gvir effectively has a private militia. “It’s a new armed agency that basically will be dedicated to patrolling Palestinians-with-Israeli-citizenship neighborhoods in binational cities,” Sfard told me. “It’s part of the extreme right’s pursuing a complete surrender of any kind of Palestinian equal participation in Israeli public life.”

  Many of the country’s undemocratic trends date back years and years. Some Israeli historians have argued that Israel has never been a democracy. This was made clear 2018 when a law was passed that made the country the nation-state of the Jewish people — that is, a democracy for Jews and not for others. Palestinian members of the Knesset called it a law of apartheid, “a law of Jewish supremacy and told us that we will always be second-class citizens,” as lawmaker Ayman Odeh put it at the time. “What kind of democracy is it that has a population that has no voice in how it’s ruled?” Rashid Khalidi, a historian at Columbia University, told me recently.Now, Netanyahu and his coalition are forcing questions about Israel’s democracy — or lack thereof — to the fore. The Biden administration has criticized Netanyahu’s brazen judicial reforms. On Sunday, a statement from White House spokesperson Adrienne Watson expressed concern and called on Israeli leaders to “find a compromise as soon as possible.” But a line was tacked onto the end of the statement that seemed to be a contextualization of how far the White House was willing to go in its criticism. It concluded by saying that “US support for Israel’s security and democracy remains ironclad.” “Bone deep,” was how Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, described the US-Israel relationship in January.The US is Israel’s closest security partner and depends on it. What would it take for the US to readjust or withdraw its commitment? Netanyahu’s coalition consists of far-right settlers who have tested the US-Israel relationship. Last week, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman summoned Israel’s ambassador to Washington to the State Department and criticized Israel for the provocative repeal of a 2005 act that may bring settlers back to the northern West Bank.Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich drew White House criticism for comments (he later walked back) for calling for a Palestinian town to be erased. Then, last week, he rejected that there even is a Palestinian people. That type of dehumanization can lead to new extremes. At the same time, Israeli leaders are transforming the way the occupation is managed, moving it away from military and toward civilian rule under Ben Gvir. Without pushback, it will lead to an ever-more emboldened settler leadership in the country. “Palestinians will pay the price for the pause on judicial reform,” said scholar Dana El Kurd. But at what point would the Biden administration decide that there is sunlight between it and Israel on matters of security?The settler rampage on the Palestinian village of Huwara last month causing one death and 300 injuries, which came after a Palestinian gunman killed two Israeli settlers nearby, was an indication of where the US will draw at least something of a line. State Department spokesperson Ned Price called the rampage “completely unacceptable” and called for an investigation.Settler attacks are already a regular feature of Palestinian life in the occupied West Bank, but if there is another coordinated rampage, will it lead to Congress exercising oversight over arms sales to Israel? The Biden administration is unlikely to implement consequences for Israel beyond not meeting with ministers like Smotrich, but that could change. It’s not yet clear what Biden’s reported White House invitation to Netanyahu means, and what the president is willing to say behind closed doors that he won’t convey to Israel publicly. Even the most ironclad relationship can be bent out of shape.When Smotrich visited the United States earlier this month, he was met by hundreds of protesters — from the American Jewish community. One-hundred and forty-five Jewish leaders signed a statement that said he shouldn’t be provided a platform. “His presence in the US to address primarily Jewish audiences would be an affront to American Jewish values,” they wrote.Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, signed the statement and joined the protests. She says it was the first time in her life that she has protested an Israeli government official. “In a way that we’ve never seen before, there is a deep and growing concern among American Jews as it relates to Israel’s future,” Soifer told me.That deep and growing concern, just like the Biden administration’s concern, may not ultimately lead to policy changes in the United States. A new Gallup poll shows that, for the first time, Democrats sympathize more with Palestinians than Israelis. Nevertheless, Evangelical Christians remain one of Israel’s strongest constituencies in American politics.But it does seem there’s a deeper understanding emerging that for Israel to be a democracy it can’t just confront the far-right’s legal challenges, but also the entrenched occupation and the reality of oppression of Palestinians. “There is no going back to the status quo from before,” Sfard told me.Netanyahu may have paused the judicial overhaul for a month or so, but his legal assault has already revealed the hollowness of Israeli democracy, the growing rift with Washington, and the tension point with the American Jewish community.

Trump’s Jerusalem move was supposed to destabilize the entire Middle East. It didn’t.,2017-12-12,Vox,['Sarah Wildman'],"Filed under:Naming Jerusalem the capital of Israel triggered protests and four people died. But the anger, and response, was more contained than feared. When President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel last week, his announcement was bracketed by a slew of dire warnings from around the globe that it would spark mass violence and widespread instability across the Middle East. The Arab League, an organization of 22 mostly Arabic-speaking countries, warned on Sunday that Trump’s announcement “deepens tension, ignites anger, and threatens to plunge the region into more violence and chaos.” Hamas, the Islamist extremist group and political organization that controls the Gaza Strip, said Trump’s decision on Jerusalem “opens the gates of hell.”  The US State Department cautioned American diplomatic staff and their families to avoid Jerusalem’s Old City and the West Bank, including the cities of Bethlehem and Jericho, and to steer clear of crowds, and US embassies were instructed to be on alert for a backlash. The Israeli army sent in additional battalions to the West Bank following the announcement. But while many thousands did take to the streets in Jerusalem, the West Bank, Lebanon, Morocco, Yemen, Indonesia and Turkey, by Monday morning they had begun to walk away. Leaders around the world condemned Trump’s decision, and the region remains on edge, but, despite street protest, the predicted tidal wave of regional instability has so far failed to materialize. That’s not to say there wasn’t violence: Four Palestinian protesters were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces, and hundreds were wounded. On Sunday afternoon, a lone Palestinian attacker stabbed an Israeli security guard. But the incidents remained isolated and so far haven’t sparked wider protests. So why didn’t the regional instability materialize as predicted? Analysts say part of the reason protests in Israel and the West Bank are not being sustained is that the primary feeling among Palestinians right now is not rage, but rather despair and fatigue. “Many Palestinians who went through the second intifada don't want to repeat it,” says Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, referring to the five-year bloody uprising against the Israeli occupation that led to the deaths of over 3000 Palestinians and more than 1,300 Israelis, and thousands more wounded on both sides. Plus, Omari adds, Palestinians sense there is a lack of direction, and a lack of stewardship, from their political leaders, and are thus reluctant to protest without a clear purpose or guidance.However, he explains that individual acts of violence may still occur: “When there is despair, there is no way to predict what will trigger people.” Which means the situation remains potentially volatile.Israelis and Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital. Though Israel’s parliament and the prime minister’s home are in Jerusalem, they sit in West Jerusalem, the side of the city Israel has controlled since 1949. Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed that half of the city. The international community views that land as occupied territory; the Palestinians would like it to be their capital oen day. Since 1988 and the beginning of a peace process that envisioned a two-state solution to the conflict — that is, an independent Palestinian state and an independent Israeli state side by side — US policy has been to leave the status of Jerusalem to be decided by the two sides as part of a final peace agreement. But decades later, there’s still no peace agreement. And the city has not stayed stagnant in the intervening years. The Israelis have continued to build neighborhoods around the city, and its two sides, East and West, have become more and more entwined. And over the years, changes to the status quo in Jerusalem has triggered violence. In 2000, Israel’s then-Israeli-opposition leader Ariel Sharon made a widely criticized and highly publicized visit to the central area of Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. The move sparked riots in the city that eventually resulted in the second intifada. Just this past July, Israeli security measures restricting access to the al-Aqsa Mosque complex set off another wave of protests and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces. This time, though, experts aren’t seeing that kind of sustained violence and chaos, and they aren’t — yet — predicting it to emerge.Protests may start spontaneously, says Khaled Elgindy, a fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution who served as an adviser to the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah on permanent status negotiations, but “to sustain an uprising ... they have to be driven by political organization.” That’s not happening, he says, in part because “Palestinian politics is in a state of disarray.” The biggest protest Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has made thus far is his announcement that he will not meet with Vice President Mike Pence when he arrives in the region next week.  The Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian interim government conceived in 1993 when the Oslo peace process began, is in turmoil, Elgindy notes. Among Palestinians, several experts told me, there is a lot of frustration directed at their own leaders over their decision to try, initially, to work with the Trump administration, despite widespread concern about Trump’s approach to the region. Trump’s announcement on Jerusalem, Elgindy says, “was a huge set back” for Palestinian leadership. “The discourse inside Palestine,” he continues, “is that’s it's over. Trump stabbed the two-state solution and the whole Oslo process in the heart.” That means the frustration and concern in the Palestinian cities and towns is directed at Palestinian leaders as well as at Israel and the US. There is also a dawning anxiety that Palestinians have no purchase on the international stage. They are alone. “I think people are a) a little bit in shock, and b) regrouping,” says Diana Buttu, a Ramallah-based analyst and a former legal adviser to Abbas and Palestinian negotiators. “I also suspect that people are quite tired. It is exhausting to live here,” she adds. “Jerusalem is definitely important, but it is exhausting to have to think about all the issues you have to push back against on a daily basis.”  The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"What are the ""two-state solution"" and the ""one-state solution""?",2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:These are the two broad ways the Israeli-Palestinian conflict might end.Editor’s note, November 9, 2023: This story has been updated to reflect details of the current Israel-Hamas war. For all of Vox’s latest coverage on Israel and Palestine, see our storystream.The “two-state solution” would create an independent Israel and Palestine, and is the mainstream approach to resolving the conflict. The idea is that Israelis and Palestinians both want to have their countries; Israelis want a Jewish state, and Palestinians want a Palestinian one. Because neither side can get what it wants in a binational state, the only possible solution that satisfies everyone involves separating Palestinians and Israelis.The “one-state solution” would merge Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip into one big country. It comes in two versions. One, favored by some leftists and Palestinians, would create a single democratic country. Arab Muslims would outnumber Jews, thus ending Israel as a Jewish state. The other version, favored by many on the Israeli right, would involve Israel annexing the West Bank and either forcing out Palestinians or denying them the right to vote. Virtually the entire world, including most Israelis, rejects this option as an unacceptable human rights violation.But belief in the possibility of a two-state solution has dropped significantly, which seems to have let to a decline in public support. In one survey, published in January 2023, only 34 percent of Israeli Jews and 33 percent of Palestinians supported a two-state solution — which the authors note was “linked to low perceived feasibility.”The inability of Israelis and Palestinians to come to terms on two states has led to a recent surge in interest in a one-state solution, partly out of a sense of hopelessness and partly out of fear that if the sides cannot negotiate a two-state solution, a de facto one-state outcome will be inevitable. But each version of the one-state solution is unacceptable to one side or the other, and it is difficult to see how one could be implemented in the foreseeable future without significant violence.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
What Biden must do in Israel,2023-10-17,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:The stakes of Biden’s Mideast trip are enormous. Can he pull the region back from the brink?Biden’s team has gone to the Middle East. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Israel, Jordan, and much of the region in a marathon trip. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Israel to meet with his military counterparts, as has the top US military commander in the Middle East. Two US aircraft carrier groups have been deployed to the eastern Mediterranean to provide further support. Now, President Joe Biden is on the way to Israel himself, a rare US presidential trip to what is effectively an active war zone. I asked several Middle East policy experts: What can Biden actually accomplish? Just in going to the Middle East, Biden has delayed Israel’s decision to send ground forces into Gaza, a move that had seemed imminent for days, according to a source familiar with the administration’s thinking. That fact alone shows that Biden may be able to cool a war that is already flaring out of control. But the visit also carries the risk that the president will become inextricably linked to the ongoing destruction of Gaza — especially amid accusations that Israel had bombed a Gaza City hospital, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians, the day before the president’s arrival. (The Israeli military claimed that the deadly explosion had been caused by a malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another armed group in Gaza.) Herein lies the contradiction of Biden’s approach to Israel right now. Biden is proud of being a staunch advocate for Israel, and his supportive remarks in the wake of Hamas’s deadly October 7 attack have been gratefully received by Israelis. But he is also the one who needs to deliver a hard truth to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the country’s war cabinet: More bombing of Palestinians in Gaza, or a full-scale ground assault, will only make things worse for Israel, for the Middle East, and for America. Biden’s approach to the Middle East has long been focused on embracing allies in public — and sending sharper messages behind closed doors. But it’s not clear if those private messages always get through. Earlier this year, for example, Biden reportedly urged Netanyahu privately to scrap parts of his judicial overhaul plan, but the Israeli prime minister dismissed the advice and barreled forward with the controversial policy. The Biden administration’s key foreign policy players now realize just how bad this war could get, and how it could spill over into other countries in the region and even beyond. But if Israel can’t commit to an immediate cessation of hostilities so that water, food, medicine, and humanitarian assistance reach Palestinians in Gaza who are in need, then Biden may need to break from his usual approach and speak up publicly. (A ceasefire would require negotiations with Hamas, which Israel is unlikely to pursue right now, but Israel could unilaterally pause the bombardment of Gaza and allow for humanitarian corridors.) That may include communicating directly to the Israeli people, as President Barack Obama once tried to do in going around Netanyahu and make a plea for a two-state solution. And Biden needs to speak directly to the Palestinian people to convey that he sees the photographs of Palestinian suffering and is doing everything he can to stem the violence. If he fails to do all this, the Middle East and much of the world will not only see the US as complicit in Israel’s military campaign — as it already does — but it will be seen as of a piece with it. The larger consequence: the sapping of America’s credibility on the world stage.No country has more leverage over Israel than the United States, which has extended hundreds of billions of dollars in aid over the decades, along with bipartisan diplomatic support. Biden must turn the “bone-deep” alliance with Israel into a moment where Israel can listen.Since 2008, there have been five major rounds of conflict between Israel and Hamas, and each time the United States has worked to negotiate ceasefires, both to protect civilian lives on the ground and to ensure that the war does not expand to other parts of the Middle East. This time around, the war is already on a much larger scale: Hamas’s surprise attack has annihilated Israel’s sense of security, and Israel’s response has already left a remarkably high death toll for Palestinians in Gaza. The situation is further complicated because any ceasefire would require negotiations with Hamas, and Israel is unlikely to participate in even backchannel talks with them after the attacks.Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, understands from experience how negotiations toward such a truce would work. In May 2021, he helped secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after 11 days of conflict, in which Hamas and militant groups launched rockets into Israel and the Israeli military struck Gaza. But the fact that May 2021 wasn’t the first time that Sullivan had worked to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza shows a troubling dynamic in US Middle East policy, which seems to revolve around putting out the occasional fire rather than addressing the root causes of these conflagrations. In a 2019 podcast, he described brokering such ceasefires as “a recurring episode in American foreign policy.” In the middle of a war of this scale, the root causes of the conflict between Israel and Palestine will not be addressed. But there has been a slight change in the tenor of the Biden administration’s approach over the last week. The main focus has been on opening the Egyptian border crossing of Rafah in Gaza to let in humanitarian aid and allow for people to leave Gaza. Blinken appointed David Satterfield, a career diplomat, as a special envoy to “urgently address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.” Sullivan went on the Sunday talk shows this past weekend to talk about the humanitarian situation for Palestinians and said that Israel has “in fact turned the water pipe back on in Southern Gaza.” (Reporting from Business Insider disputes this and quoted a US official saying that water access remains “limited.”) This recognition of Palestinian rights and needs, however limited, may stem from Blinken’s shuttling to Arab capitals, where leaders reportedly rebuked him in public and private for a de-emphasis on Palestine. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi condemned the death of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and said, “This is the result of accumulated fury and hatred over four decades, where the Palestinians had no hope to find a solution.” Blinken’s efforts to get Saudi Arabia to denounce Hamas’s attack have not yet been successful, according to the Washington Post. The Biden administration requires the support of Arab partners in determining Gaza’s future after the Israeli military campaign. A visit to Tel Aviv in which Biden endorses an Israeli policy that includes ongoing attacks that have resulted in significant civilian deaths in Gaza would backfire. It will be harder and harder to say that what Israel is doing to Gaza is self-defense.Biden told 60 Minutes this weekend that Israel choosing to invade and actively occupy Gaza would be “a big mistake” and that “there needs to be a Palestinian authority. There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state.” Yet he still expressed full support for Israel. A busy week of diplomacy has alerted the Biden administration of the urgency of playing both sides against the middle, but that can sound like contradictory policies. “Biden has said he supports Israel destroying Hamas, but he doesn’t want a civilian catastrophe, a humanitarian disaster,” Mairav Zonszein, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told me. “I don’t know if those two things can coexist.”Israel also faces a contradictory crisis of its own: whether the provision of badly needed water, food, and medicine to Gaza would reinforce Hamas. “Israel — they’ve done this before, and they’re continuing to — use humanitarian aid as a tool, and they’re very, very concerned that Hamas will try to take advantage of those openings and use those materials,” Zonszein explained. “Paradoxically, if Israel wants to have freedom of operation, per se, to continue, then it has to deal with the humanitarian aspect. It can’t just ignore it completely because then it really will lose its ability, I think, to have any legitimacy in acting.”Biden may have already achieved something just by going to the Middle East: slowing the ground offensive. But given the stakes of the current war, the depth of US involvement in support of Israel, and the potential risk of a catastrophic regional conflict, that’s not enough. Experts I spoke with say he’ll need to convey to Netanyahu that each day the military campaign goes on in Gaza, Israel is raising the potential for militant groups like Hezbollah to join the war; pushing away potential Arab allies like Saudi Arabia, eliminating any prospect of normalization with Arab states like Saudi Arabia; and ending the decades-long stalled peace process once and for all.Biden could call for clear ground rules for the occupied West Bank, where settler violence against Palestinians, already at unprecedented levels, is rising. And he must emphasize the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel, who face a surge of discrimination. Experienced Middle East analysts and grassroots activists agree that an immediate truce is needed so that urgent humanitarian aid can reach Gaza. “We strongly urge the Biden administration and US partners to seek, at a minimum, a temporary cessation in fighting to allow for the delivery of direly needed food, water, medical supplies and other critical aid immediately necessary to the preservation of life,” the Center for International Policy, a progressive Washington think tank, said in a statement. Biden might also convey the extent to which Israel bombing Gaza won’t work because it hasn’t worked. Eliminating Hamas isn’t really a policy. If it were one, then Israel might have been successful in the previous rounds of intensive conflict since 2008-2009.At the same time, Biden surely understands that in the wake of the Hamas attacks, Israel needs to establish a sense of security for its citizens. “Israel has to be able to restore its military deterrence superpower because if it doesn’t, then Israel will appear weak; by extension, the US will appear weak,” Zonszein told me. “On the public level and on the leadership level, it’s an existential war — not because the attack itself presented an existential threat, but because the level of success it had in undermining the basic safety and security of Israelis is so deep that they can’t remain there.”  But he also must know that an Israeli ground incursion into Gaza won’t solve that calculus and will instead cause irreparable damage to Palestinian life, while setting back Israel and the United States for decades in the Middle East. On his Substack, Marc Lynch, a political scientist at George Washington University, has detailed how such an invasion would be a “humanitarian, strategic and moral catastrophe” — one that Biden could be in the sole position to prevent. “And I would beg the White House,” Lynch continues, “to step back and reconsider whether granting Israel blanket immunity in the coming days really serves the interests of either Israel or the United States, or if what Israel really needs right now is an external hand to impose restraint and save it from its own worst impulses.”“The coming days look likely to be filled with horrific images and a horrific reality. It’s not too late to avoid that… but it’s getting there.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Jared Kushner, Peter Navarro, and our epidemic of overconfidence",2020-04-07,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:The Trump administration is plagued by the Dunning-Kruger effect — the overconfidence of the ignorant. And it’s making the rest of America sick.It was the White House coronavirus clash of the heavyweights: Dr. Anthony Fauci, perhaps the most respected public health official currently working in the US government, against Peter Navarro, an eccentric Trump economic adviser who shares the president’s anti-China obsession (and once quoted a fake version of himself named Ron Vara — an anagram for Navarro — in a book he wrote). Per Axios, Navarro got into it during a coronavirus task force meeting on Saturday. Navarro claimed that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that Trump had been touting as a potential counter-coronavirus drug, had been shown to have “clear therapeutic efficacy” in foreign trials. When Fauci, who has become one of the most trusted medical experts on the subject, corrected him by pointing out that the evidence for the drug’s success against coronavirus was “anecdotal,” Navarro reportedly flew into a rage — raising his voice and (falsely) accusing Fauci of opposing the travel ban Trump imposed on China.On Monday, CNN’s John Berman asked Navarro about the confrontation: “What are your qualifications to weigh in on medicine more than Dr. Anthony Fauci?” Navarro’s response: “My qualifications, in terms of looking at the science, is that I’m a social scientist.”It’s only fitting that there’s a concept from social science — psychology, specifically — that helps us understand Navarro’s bluster. In a now-famous 1999 paper, Cornell University’s David Dunning and Justin Kruger found that people who did poorly on tests of abilities like logic and grammar “grossly overestimated” their own talents in those fields relative to peers. Competent people, by contrast, were less likely to overestimate their own talents. It seemed that the incompetent people knew so little that they were unable to adequately assess how little they knew — and thus were overconfident.This phenomenon, known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, may explain Navarro’s outburst. There are important differences in this case: Navarro has basic knowledge and expertise — he has a PhD in economics from Harvard, and actually warned Trump early on about the risks from coronavirus. He is not, however, an expert on medicine, and an economics doctorate doesn’t qualify him to give medical assessments over Fauci. But not being an expert also means that you’re unable to fully appreciate how little you know — and perhaps might even make you feel comfortable shouting down a preeminent expert in the field on an issue of vital national importance. It’s not just Navarro, though. The entire Trump administration is an exercise in what happens when people without relevant expertise get to run the world’s most powerful government. Nothing makes that clear than its response to the coronavirus.No figure, other than the president himself, better embodies the ethos of the Trump administration’s coronavirus effort than Jared Kushner.A presidential son-in-law with no relevant experience in medicine or epidemiology, Kushner has nonetheless come to occupy a key role in coordinating the White House’s response to the virus. He has been previously failed in his roles attempting to solve the opioid crisis and the Israel-Palestine conflict (about which he once bragged about having read 25 books).Early on in the crisis, per the New York Times, Kushner told Trump that the media was overhyping the virus to hurt his presidency. He later went on to convince Trump to hype an essentially nonexistent Google testing website, crowdsourced ideas for policy responses from said brother’s father-in-law, and launched a drive-through testing initiative that (as of early April) produced a grand total of five testing sites across the country.Despite Kushner’s efforts, the testing situation in America remains dire. A dearth of adequate and rapid tests makes it harder for doctors and nurses to allocate scarce resources to the patients who need it. In the long run, the failure to test makes it harder for America to relax social distancing measures and move toward a South Korea-style surveillance model.Failure after failure, both during the pandemic and his broader time in government, Kushner reportedly remains convinced of his own abilities — that he knows better than anyone else, including federal experts and state officials.“Kushner shares the president’s view that governors are driving their residents into a panic by airing worst-case projections of medical needs,” the Times reports. “In conversations with advisers to the president, many of whom were stunned by the remark, Mr. Kushner has stressed what he considers his own abilities, saying that he has figured out how to make the government effective.” By any reasonable lights, Kushner shouldn’t be anywhere near the White House’s coronavirus response — let alone coordinating it. Navarro, widely considered a crank in his own field of economics despite his Harvard degree, shouldn’t be in the White House — let alone working on the coronavirus response team. Yet Kushner is in on purely nepotistic grounds — and he reportedly brought Navarro in after discovering the latter’s book on Amazon.This is the nature of the American government today. The Republican Party and its allies in the right-wing media have spent the past several decades attacking the very idea of neutral policy expertise, treating academia as enemy-held territory rather than a source of important knowledge about the world. As a result, it became fertile ground for an arrogant anti-elite populist — a man who seems to believe he knows more than everyone about everything — to take it over and remake in his image. Experts aren’t infallible, of course. If there’s one thing we’ve learned in the past two decades, it’s that our elite class is eminently capable of catastrophic failure.Yet blanket skepticism of elites in Trump’s style is no more justified than blind faith in their pronouncements. In fact, it’s arguably quite a bit more dangerous, particularly when it comes to something like a pandemic response, a difficult task that requires understanding and synthesizing conclusions from a variety of technical and deeply specialized intellectual disciplines.  Instead, though, we have a president and a ruling party that instinctively distrusts the people most qualified to do that. It is under these conditions that Jared Kushner and Peter Navarro could end up playing key roles in confronting the biggest public health crisis in a century.Trump, Kushner, and Navarro may be the ones suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect. But Americans will be the ones suffering the consequences.lease consider making a contribution to Vox today.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
A bloody week for Israel and Palestine culminates with a shooting in the West Bank,2023-04-07,Vox,['Nicole Narea'],"Filed under:Will the violence escalate further?A week of escalating tensions between Israelis and Palestinians seemed to culminate Friday with a shooting in the occupied West Bank in which two Israeli sisters were killed and their mother was critically injured. The attack exacerbated fears about intensifying violence in the region, and deepened international concerns about whether deescalation is possible in the short term.The shooting, which Israeli authorities are investigating as a terrorist attack, came just hours after Israeli airstrikes targeting the Palestinian Islamic militant group Hamas in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Hamas has not claimed responsibility for the shooting. Israel ordered the airstrikes in response to a bombardment of rockets fired from Lebanon on Thursday night — the largest since the countries went to war in 2006. Israel blamed Hamas for firing the rockets, but also has held the government of Lebanon, which is struggling with its own political and economic crises, responsible for failing to prevent the attack. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it “will not allow the Hamas terrorist organization to operate from within Lebanon and holds the state of Lebanon responsible for every directed fire emanating from its territory.” Those rocket strikes themselves were in response to Israeli police twice raiding the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem earlier this week, as Palestinians prayed during Ramadan services.For now, neither Israel nor Hamas has articulated a desire to escalate the conflict. Reuters reported Friday that “quiet will be answered with quiet at this stage” by the Israeli army, and that Hamas would do the same after having “made its point.”But 2022 proved the deadliest year for Palestinians living in the West Bank since the United Nations started recording killings in 2005, and the conflict has continued to claim many lives this year. At least 90 Palestinians and 15 Israelis, almost all civilians, have been killed in 2023 so far, according to CNN, meaning that the violence could potentially be worse this year than the last.Tensions spiked this week after Israeli police twice stormed the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and arrested hundreds of Palestinians as they offered up prayers during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The mosque is considered one of the holiest sites in the Muslim world, and is built on one of Judaism’s holiest sites.Israeli police say they were looking to arrest “law-breaking youths and masked agitators” who had brought stones and fireworks into the mosque, refused to leave, and tried to barricade themselves inside, despite a prior agreement with the mosque’s authorities that no one would be allowed to stay in the mosque overnight during Ramadan. It’s not clear exactly why they tried to barricade themselves inside, but Palestinians have been worried that Jewish nationalist groups are encouraging inflammatory practices at the mosque, which is one of the few remaining national symbols over which they have some control.CNN reported that, on Wednesday, police had broken windows and doors to enter, deflected fireworks with riot shields, and used stun grenades, rubber bullets, and batons on the crowd. At least 12 people, including two Israeli police officers, were injured in that altercation. The raids have drawn swift condemnation from neighboring Muslim and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Qatar. The White House has expressed concern about the violence and urged Israelis and Palestinians to deescalate the situation.The US Office of Palestinian Affairs tweeted Wednesday that “Violence has no place in a holy site and during a holy season. Alarmed by the shocking scenes in Al Aqsa Mosque and rockets launched from Gaza toward Israel. We call for restraint and de-escalation to allow peaceful worship and to protect the sanctity of the holy sites.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formed the most far-right coalition government in the country’s history, and human rights organizations have blamed its nationalist, exclusionist policies for the escalating violence against Palestinians. Netanyahu has already seen a central pillar of his coalition’s platform backfire: a judicial overhaul that was seen as a transparent power grab and sparked some of the biggest protests in the country’s history.But his coalition of ultra-Orthodox and religious Zionist parties have also advanced policies of Jewish supremacy, abandoning any notion of negotiating with Palestinians. An agreement laying out the coalition’s ideology states that “The Jewish people have an exclusive and inalienable right over all areas of the Land of Israel.” It has since authorized more Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians live under Israeli rule. Violent uprisings among Israeli settlers there have become increasingly common this year. In response to these and other long-worsening conditions, grassroots Palestinian groups and individuals are increasingly turning to violent resistance and occasionally terrorism.Netanyahu’s coalition has also maintained a controversial policy, initiated under the previous government, that allows Israeli forces to open fire in a broad set of circumstances, such as when arresting someone suspected of committing a felony crime or planning a suicide attack, or in life-threatening situations. That policy, criticized by human rights groups as permitting use of excessive force, led to the accidental shooting of a Palestinian American reporter for Al Jazeera last year. The US has called on Israel to reconsider the policy. Israel claims that it’s responding to rising attacks by Palestinian militants. But its strategy raises the risk of intensifying tit-for-tat attacks like the series of violent incidents sparked by the storming of al-Aqsa this week.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."

4 stories that mattered in politics this week,2017-12-08,Vox,['Matthew Yglesias'],"Filed under:Chaos in Congress.Congress wrapped up one of its most inglorious weeks in recent memory today, slinking out of town under heavy clouds of scandal. Three members of Congress announced resignations this week, and almost everyone believes there will be more to come. Meanwhile, leaders of both parties in effect asked for an extension on reaching an agreement on how to fund the government next year, and Republicans’ moment of triumph on taxes was stolen away from them on the recognition that the bill the Senate passed last week suffers from massive drafting errors. Then the White House decided that, for good measure, it wanted to stir the pot a little on the Israel-Palestine conflict for no particular reason.Here’s what you need to know.  It turns out that when you draft your major tax legislation late at night at a rapid pace with little outside scrutiny, you wind up doing some pretty sloppy legislating. Senate Republicans appear to have written a corporate AMT provision that they intended to raise a little bit of revenue in a sloppy way that actually raises a ton of revenue and alienates the businesses who were supposed to benefit from a big tax cut.Speaking Wednesday at the White House, President Donald Trump gave a speech, saying, “Today we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel’s capital.”Under considerable pressure from his colleagues, Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) announced plans to resign his Senate seat after facing a range of sexual misconduct allegations. After several days of intensifying verbal conflict, Democratic and Republican leaders agreed to kick the can down the road and extend government funding for two weeks to avert an early-December showdown.

The Israel-Hamas prisoner deal was extended. What comes next?,2023-11-27,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:Monday’s extension is good news for anyone concerned about the humanitarian situation, but the bigger questions about the future of the war remain.Israel and Hamas agreed Monday to extend a temporary ceasefire under which dozens of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners have been released from captivity. The deal will continue the initial four-day humanitarian pause in fighting through this coming Thursday morning, with the potential for further extensions. The Qatar-mediated agreement is the longest break in hostilities since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing over 1,200 people, and the Israel Defense Forces launched an air and ground assault that has devastated large parts of northern Gaza and killed more than 13,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The pause has allowed Palestinian civilians to safely access humanitarian goods like food, water, medical supplies, and other basic necessities amid the critical lack caused by the war.Monday’s extension, then, is good news for anyone concerned about the humanitarian conditions and plight of prisoners and hostages. But the bigger questions about the war’s path and the future of Gaza remain as unclear as they were when this pause began.One Israeli American citizen, a 4-year-old girl held hostage by Hamas in Gaza since October 7, was released into Israel Sunday as part of the 50 Israeli hostages released since Friday. In return, 150 Palestinian prisoners previously in Israeli jails — minors and women — have been released from detention back to their families. As Vox’s Abdallah Fayyad explained, Israel holds “thousands of Palestinians, including hundreds of children ... on murky legal grounds.” Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad are still holding well over 100 hostages in Gaza. Most are Israeli or dual citizens, but a number of other nationalities are included in that group, including laborers from countries like Thailand and the Philippines. More than a dozen of those foreigners were released over the weekend. Over the next two days, both sides will release more hostages and prisoners; while no announcements about the extension specified how many on either side, an Egyptian official indicated Monday that Hamas might release 20 hostages while Israel frees 60 prisoners. At this pace of exchange, the ceasefire could continue for days, given the number of hostages still in Gaza. But there is no agreed-upon framework for a long-term deal, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that the war will go on after the current ceasefire concludes. While the prisoner exchange could strengthen Hamas’s political position, further complicating Israel’s goal to eradicate the group, Israel appears undeterred.For weeks, news outlets had been reporting about an impending ceasefire and prisoner exchange, but Qatari and US politicians began speaking openly about such a deal and their role in it only last week as an agreement finally appeared near. (Because Israel and Hamas don’t have direct diplomatic channels, Qatar and Egypt, which maintain communication channels with Hamas, were pivotal in securing the ceasefire and exchange.)According to the Associated Press, discussions about a prisoner and hostage exchange emerged as soon as October 12, with the first proposal suggesting all women and children held in Gaza be released in exchange for freeing all Palestinian women held in Israeli prison. That proposal morphed into the current deal over weeks of negotiations brokered primarily by Qatar. Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, voted in favor of the deal last Wednesday, with only the ultranationalist, far-right religious party of National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir voting against the proposal, according to the Times of Israel. Though there will still be about 150 hostages in Gaza after this extension, that doesn’t mean Hamas can use them to prolong the ceasefire indefinitely; it can only continue another five days following the first extension. Hamas has also only agreed to release civilians; although the militant group that controls Gaza has taken some Israeli soldiers hostage, guaranteeing their release will require further negotiations, Raphael Cohen, director of the Rand Corporation’s Strategy and Doctrine Program, Rand Project Air Force, told Vox. “When the Israelis want to get the soldiers back, that will presumably be on different terms. It’s one thing if you’re trading Israeli civilians for a handful of, primarily, women and minors,” some of whom are alleged to have committed serious crimes, Cohen said. For Hamas to release the soldiers, they may ask for “people who Israel believes have actually committed murder and who are more senior Hamas operatives — that’s a very different political calculus.”Though the ceasefire and prisoner exchange has gone through with minimal interruption, there was an hours-long delay in Saturday’s exchange when Hamas threatened to call off the deal, saying that Israel had not abided by its part of the agreement. However, the planned exchange went ahead, and as of Monday, all parties had agreed to a continuation of the pause. Qatar has become a major player in global diplomacy and has been an important part of the current negotiations, in part because it’s one of two nations that maintains a direct relationship with Hamas. “It wants to be influential, diplomatically, and it does understand that, obviously, it’s not a regional superpower that can dictate things,” Bessma Momani, a political science professor at the University of Waterloo, told Vox’s Jen Kirby. That puts Qatar into a challenging balancing act:Yet maintaining these delicate ties — and working those connections — is a very good way for Qatar to advance its interests, and its security. That approach comes with some risks, but, at least right now, they don’t outweigh the upsides for Qatar.Hamas has, in the past, taken hostages as a negotiating tool to get Palestinian prisoners released from detention in Israel, and it has historically been effective — often asymmetrically so, as in the case of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who, after being held by Hamas for five years, was traded in 2011 for more than 1,000 Palestinian detainees.The present exchange, though nowhere near that scale, still notches a political win for Hamas.“It shows that not only is Hamas defying this notion that they’re going to be destroyed,” Khaled Elgindy, director of the Middle East Institute’s program on Palestine and Palestinian-Israeli affairs, told Vox. “Israel is still talking about eradicating Hamas, but they’re forcing Israel to negotiate with them and to release Palestinian prisoners, even in relatively small numbers.”As Fayyad wrote, Israeli jails hold thousands of Palestinian prisoners, many of whom are held under administrative detention — meaning indefinitely and without being charged, for reasons as minor as a social media post or nonviolent protest — in the name of national security. Those who do get a trial are tried in military courts, where the conviction rate is around 99 percent:Israel maintains that it detains people because of legitimate security concerns, such as potential participation in violent attacks. But while there is a thin veneer of due process … ‘Evidence has shown that [administrative detention] is a pretext to persecute and deprive people of their fundamental rights and freedoms because they challenge the Israeli military occupation,’ said [Elizabeth Rghebi, the Middle East and North Africa advocacy director at Amnesty International USA.]Many Palestinians “have had loved ones who have been arrested, detained, tortured, [or had other] experiences in Israeli prisons,” Elgindy said. “The fact that Hamas can deliver that in the midst of the most ferocious bombing campaigns we have ever seen in the Gaza Strip is pretty remarkable.”The ceasefire will also allow Hamas to rearm, to a degree, although substantial regrouping and rearmament would take longer than the brief period allowed under the ceasefire deal, Cohen said. Israel’s defense minister Yoav Gallant promised that the pause in hostilities would be just that, “then we will continue operating with full military power,” Reuters reported Friday.“I can’t see the truce lasting more than a week,” Miri Eisin, managing director of the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, told the Guardian. “The IDF wants to dismantle Hamas’s terror capability and military capability, and the only way to do that is through a systematic and careful ground operation.” However, the Biden administration signaled Monday that it hoped for a prolonged pause to release as many hostages as possible. What Hamas is betting could change the dynamics of the conflict is that the longer the pause, the “more international pressure there will be to make this truce permanent,” Cohen told Vox. “I think it affects more the political calculus rather than the military calculus.”The pause comes amid growing congressional calls for conditions on military aid to Israel, a concept President Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan didn’t explicitly dismiss during an interview on Sunday’s Meet the Press.Despite that, there is no appetite within Israel to negotiate for a permanent ceasefire right now, Cohen said. “At the end of the day, none of the structural dynamics here have actually changed — Hamas has been rooted out of more than half of the Gaza Strip, optimistically. It’s still in control of the southern half; many of the Hamas senior leaders ... are still at large, which means that stopping now functionally just means that you’ve bought yourself a couple of years of peace, and you’re going to be in the same place again just in a matter of a couple of years.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The power and peril of documentaries in a skeptical culture,2021-08-10,Vox,['Alissa Wilkinson'],"Filed under:The new documentary The Viewing Booth asks if images are losing their power.On January 6, watching the footage of the US Capitol, I wondered what I would have seen if I were still 15 years old.Back in the mid-’90s, I was a homeschooled high schooler in a profoundly conservative homeschooling community. My friends and I spent our Friday nights in small group “worldview” studies. Evangelical leaders on VHS tapes taught us that the US Constitution was divinely inspired, that America’s founders were all devoted Christians, trickle-down Reaganomics and male-led churches and governments were God’s plan for the world, and that you could understand people by slotting everyone into “competing worldviews,” for which we had a handy chart.The chart was a decoder ring, letting us see through “media bias” and “liberal lies” to arrive at an objective view on the truth. That was the basis of the whole project, we were told: to learn to think critically about what we saw or heard or read. Thus educated, we would be impervious to bias. We would be the ones who saw the world the right way.On January 6, I imagined being my 10th-grade self, watching the events that I now consider to have been an insurrection unfold on the nightly news — all we had back then — against the backdrop of my worldview grid. I would have noticed that some people were flying Christian flags, or repeating talking points I’d heard before about liberty and freedom. I would, I think, have seen Christian heroes, standing up for liberty and against oppression.Would I have found the violence disturbing, I wondered? Would I have found the footage shocking?Probably. But thanks to that worldview grid, I would also have defense mechanisms to help me push back against my discomfort. I would have found a way to justify what I was seeing. It’s what our textbooks often did when confronted with many violent historical facts — the entire history of race in America, or the uneasy truth about what our fledgling nation did to its indigenous population in the course of westward expansion. As a teen, I learned that Bill Clinton was unfit to be president because of his sexual conduct, but that Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich — despite his own scandals — was just fine. I heard you could be “pro-life” and still excuse those who advocated for torture and war. I could believe that slavery, as abstractly as I understood it, was fundamentally bad, and simultaneously accept the suggestion of a “Christian hero” biography checked out of my church library in upstate New York that Robert E. Lee was someone to admire and emulate.As a community, we found a way to show that what seemed wrong was right, actually, in this case. Eager to please the adults, with almost no exposure to anyone who thought differently, I assumed the grown-ups were right. So when those folks stormed the Capitol, what 15-year-old me would have seen were patriots revolting against an unjust power grab, fulfilling the founders’ wishes and, by extension, God’s.I’m pretty sure being confronted with facts that challenged my beliefs, and then finding a way around them, would only have made me feel more confident that I was right. I was startled to hear that same analysis — that knowing how to circumvent challenges to my worldview would only strengthen it — from the lips of the subject of a new documentary, The Viewing Booth.I first saw the film at the True/False Film Festival in March 2020, long before the Capitol insurrection, a week before most Americans realized this pandemic was going to be a thing. It stuck in my mind all year. I thought about it when I watched video footage of George Floyd’s murder. I thought about it as I heard people declare that protests against police brutality and unrest across the country were staged or “false flag” operations. I thought about it while watching videos of my co-religionists (albeit in a branch I’ve left behind) protesting common-sense public health measures by gathering in public squares to sing songs I know.The Viewing Booth isn’t about any of those things — though, in a real sense, it’s about all of them. Israeli documentarian Ra’anan Alexandrowicz has long been an activist opposed to the occupation of Palestine, and has made films that try to show what’s going on in the hope of shifting his audience’s opinion. That process has made him think deeply about the ethics of documentary; for instance, after making his 2001 film The Inner Tour, he realized that as an Israeli, he could no longer in good conscience point his camera at Palestinians in occupied territories. He remained committed to the work of being an activist-documentarian, but started thinking about how we watch as much as what we see.Alexandrowicz shot The Viewing Booth at Temple University, where he is a researcher. He asked American students who said they were interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to enter a constructed viewing booth, where they watched videos related to the occupation uploaded to the internet by both activists and pro-Israeli outlets, and to verbalize their thoughts.He ended up centering the film on the reactions of one young woman, Maia Levy, an American of Israeli descent whose stance on videos originating in the West Bank city of Hebron is in opposition to Alexandrowicz’s. Levy enters the viewing booth twice; first to watch several videos, and then again six months later to comment on the footage of her original session. In her first visit to the booth, Levy is presented with a menu of videos, from which she chooses several to watch. Some of them have been shared online by human rights activist group B’Tselem and others have been shared by pro-occupation groups. One depicts a group of Israeli soldiers raiding a home in the middle of the night, terrifying the children there and providing little explanation. In another, a soldier in an occupied zone brusquely grabs a child who happens by. A third shows soldiers giving gifts to smiling Palestinian children. Levy tells Alexandrowicz that her parents, both Israeli, have dismissed footage from B’Tselem as manipulative and manipulated garbage, and that she’s also recently traveled to the region seen in the videos. She is inclined to believe the videos from pro-Israeli sources, and to find ways to dismiss the pro-Palestinian ones. Levy narrates her reactions to Alexandrowicz as she watches, remarking upon the moments when she is skeptical of what she is seeing. Levy doesn’t think the videos are faked, exactly. But she wonders what key information might have been left out to cast them in a new light. Did the soldiers receive a tip that a bomb was planted in the home? Did they pay those children to be filmed receiving gifts? Why is a camera present in the first place? She pauses the videos and explains what she’s thinking, answering questions Alexandrowicz poses to unpack her reactions even more.The point of The Viewing Booth isn’t to hear what someone like Levy thinks about the occupation and the conflict. Nor is it to demonstrate that Levy’s pre-existing beliefs affect how she interprets what she sees; that’s obvious. Instead, Alexandrowicz wants to hear her vocalize her thoughts as she watches, and to think about what they demonstrate about how we view images today.I talked to Alexandrowicz in July 2021, nearly 18 months after I first saw The Viewing Booth and on the verge of its public premiere. What he noted during our conversation was that making the film taught him a lot about the defense mechanisms we tend to bring to images that challenge our beliefs — something we all do, no matter how objective we believe we are. Alexandrowicz largely leaves his personal opinion out of the film, instead interrogating Levy’s framework for viewing the videos on offer. His most basic aim was to gain insight into the challenges of using images and video to change people’s minds on issues that populate today’s specific media landscape. He was coming at this subject from a very particular vantage point: as a documentarian working in these still-early days of the 21st century.Watching video in the present context is different than it was in the 1990s, or in the 1960s, or in the 1920s, or at the dawn of moving images. One obvious reason is that the world we live in now is saturated by images and videos, which can have a numbing effect. We’re privy to intimate images of so much more of the world’s suffering today than previous generations ever were. On top of that, most everyone who watches videos today has also made videos of their own — probably on the smartphone in their pocket — which means even as audience members, we’re more aware of how we choose what goes in the frame and what stays out of it, and how those choices can manipulate the viewer. We already bring some knowledge of the filmmaking process to the screen.Another factor, Alexandrowicz says, might be even more impactful. When I talked to him about The Viewing Booth, he noted that education often involves learning how to think critically of the media we consume, which is vital and yet can have unintended consequences. “Critiquing, reframing, all the tools that come from critical theory and critical viewing are sort of very accessible now to audiences, which is great,” he said. “But at the same time, when people are viewing images that are difficult for them ideologically, these critical tools become a defense mechanism.”Learning to carefully consider the images we see in media is good, because it hopefully means we don’t just swallow what we see on screen without thinking about it. Simultaneously, we come away with tools we can use to reject images that conflict with our views. “It creates a situation in which criticizing media is a way to not see what it is,” he says. “Thinking critically” is vital to living wisely today. But that doesn’t mean the same approach can’t be deployed to rewrite reality.The context in which we encounter videos and images has also shifted, especially in a streaming age. News, entertainment, and verité footage uploaded to the internet by any random person can and often is all accessed through the same screen or device. If you’ve ever watched a TV show where actors play out a scene that looks similar to what you’re seeing in a YouTube clip, and you’re watching both the show and the YouTube clip on similar screens, it’s even more difficult to resist having the fiction frame how you understand the nonfiction.In The Viewing Booth, Levy accepts that the video in which soldiers break into a home where children are sleeping shows something that actually happened — that the raid wasn’t, itself, fiction. But she floats the possibility that the soldiers might have heard there was a bomb in the house, and when Alexandrowicz asks where that thought came from, she realizes it’s from the Israeli Netflix drama Fauda. Whether or not a bomb is present, the images of crying, traumatized children are powerful. Still, the possibility of the bomb as an excuse changes things for Levy.For Alexandrowicz, Levy’s thought process illustrates another defense mechanism, which has to do with the way we watch fiction and the way we watch nonfiction. The difference between the two can be surprisingly hard to parse, but Alexandrowicz thinks of it as the difference between two forms of consciousness. There’s the “nonfiction consciousness,” which he defines as “the knowledge or belief that what we are looking at has a direct relation to reality, to the real world.” It’s the state of mind in which we watch documentaries; it’s why we get angry when we find out that something in a documentary is faked but not disclosed — say, the voice of a human, using an AI.In contrast, when we watch with our “fiction consciousness,” we expect a level of mediation. “Someone wanted to portray reality, and then they created a production and they cast people to be in that situation,” he says. That mediation gives us a layer of remove. Someone who gets killed onscreen in a film, we assume, didn’t really die. A crying person is acting. It’s emotionally easier to bear.Because we have these two consciousnesses at our disposal, Alexandrowicz hypothesizes that another defense mechanism develops when we “fictionalize” the nonfiction, by finding a way to insert a layer between ourselves and the image. In other words, we try to find a way to cast the nonfiction as fiction. “If [Levy] could see the same image, but experience it in a more fiction-consciousness way, that would take away some of the weight of images threatening her,” Alexandrowicz suggested. In a way, I think that’s what many people found themselves doing on January 6. Media coverage and politicians’ speeches seemed more devoted to bending the insurrection into the form of a Hollywood blockbuster than grappling with the deep rot it unveiled. A similar response seems to pop up whenever a huge, traumatic event is unfolding. Thinking of the news as another episode of TV or an action thriller, however unconsciously, helps us believe that we fully understand what we are watching. Rarely is that the case.Becoming more critical of images and videos thanks to our collective status as both viewers and creators, and our understanding of the way videos and images can manipulate the truth, has contributed to an overall sense among contemporary audiences that what we see cannot be trusted and requires further interrogation. On balance, Alexandrowicz agrees, that’s good. However, if that baseline of increased suspicion makes it harder for any of us to maintain a “nonfiction consciousness” — to believe that images can teach us true things about the world — what happens to documentary? To the news? To activists who make videos? If the trend toward skepticism and mistrust continues — or even worsens, with the mounting certainty of high-quality deepfakes just over the horizon — what happens next?After watching The Viewing Booth, I wondered whether, had I been my 15-year-old self during the Capitol insurrection, I would have been convinced at all by the images I was seeing that something was wrong. I thought about people who saw videos of George Floyd, or of an angry mob forcibly entering the halls of Congress, and were able to deploy defense mechanisms that strengthened their existing views. I wondered when I’ve done it myself.There is no simple solution, no good way to easily navigate inherent disbelief.One thing The Viewing Booth made me think about, however, is the difference between objectivity and reflexivity, and how all of us could stand to more frequently reflect on the act of viewing. (Interestingly, the Hebrew title of the film is Mirror.) “I think the only thing I come out of the film with, something that allows me to move forward, is this idea that everything is so polarized, but maybe one thing that could still be unpolarized is reflecting on how the process of subjectivity works,” Alexandrowicz said. Looking for, confronting, and scrutinizing the reasons we interpret a video or image a particular way can help us come to terms with the whys of it — and combat the tendency to believe that we are “objective” viewers. You probably unconsciously know that your own beliefs factor into how much you trust the image in front of you. But directly acknowledging as much can have a powerful effect. “What it taught me is that when I’m thinking of how to maybe try to convince people of things — not that [Levy] was convinced in the film, but there was a process there — is that maybe a question mark is more effective than an exclamation mark,” Alexandrowicz explained.For him, that lesson will affect the way he approaches his future work, and how he thinks about media literacy: “Usually, we refer to media literacy as educating people on how to better read media and understand it. But I think what this film suggests is that there is another part of media literacy, and that is understanding ourselves as viewers.”For me, it shifts how I view myself. I suspect that I sometimes assume I am more of an “objective” viewer than a subjective one because I’m critical of what I watch, as a good 21st century viewer with a camera in my pocket. But does that actually make me more objective? Or am I falling into the same trap I would have when I was 15, by separating myself from what upsets me and finding ways to sidestep what bothers me? How would I know?That awareness gives me a new set of questions to interrogate myself with. When am I using my critical eye as a way to reinforce my own biases, or to avoid being threatened by the weight of what I am seeing? Can I reflect on those responses, rather than attributing them only to the footage I’ve just watched?It’s hard work, but work worth doing. There is no going back. We are all living in our own little viewing booths — and if we want to know the world as it is, and even love it, and maybe change it, we’ve got to make sure we are looking at it straight on.

"Trade, defense, and Israel: 2020 Democrats’ foreign policy flashpoints",2019-06-26,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:Expect Democrats to fight over these three main foreign policy areas.Most Americans tend to vote on issues closer to home, like health care and the economy, rather than foreign policy. They’re unlikely to pull the lever for a candidate based on that candidate’s worldview or thoughts on grand strategy. But experts say there are a few key foreign policy issues that have the potential both to resonate with American voters and to expose important ideological rifts among the 2020 Democratic candidates — including trade and the global economy, military and defense spending, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Which means the Democratic debates this week could feature the opening salvos of a brutal ideological fight over the future of American foreign policy.There will be perhaps no bigger set of issues on foreign policy for the Democratic candidates than trade, at least early on. In general, traditional candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have defended America’s decades of free-trade economic policies. After all, seeking free trade and a globalized market has certainly helped US companies sell products abroad, rebuild foreign nations, and make America wealthy.But more left-wing candidates, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), critique this bipartisan consensus. In their view, US-fueled globalization has only lined the pockets of oligarchs and filled corporations’ coffers while failing to improve the lives of middle-class citizens.“For decades, the leaders of both parties preached the gospel that free trade was a rising tide that would lift all boats. Great rhetoric — except that the trade deals they negotiated mainly lifted the yachts and threw millions of working Americans overboard to drown,” Warren said during a foreign policy speech at American University in November.The trade debate among Democrats, then, will likely serve as a proxy fight for whether a candidate is perceived to stand with the middle class or with the ultrarich. But the candidates will also have to stake ground on key issues, primarily on the future of free-trade deals.Take the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a big free-trade agreement negotiated during the Obama administration among the US and Latin American and Asian nations — which many viewed as an overt counter to China’s growing economic power.Biden was vice president while negotiators worked out the accord. It wasn’t ratified by Congress before Biden (and Barack Obama) left office, and President Donald Trump — a free-trade critic — withdrew America’s participation from it only three days into his administration, negating any need for a vote. The remaining countries completed the deal without US involvement months later.So Biden would certainly be eager to reenter the agreement if elected president, right? Not exactly. Biden’s campaign refuses to confirm whether he supports the TPP. Buttigieg’s campaign hasn’t responded to repeated requests from journalists about his position; Warren and Sanders predictably said they are against joining the deal. Why the hesitation from Biden? Trump campaigned in part on bashing free trade, and some of his toughest challengers in the Democratic primary are fierce skeptics of it. It’s therefore likely that he sees supporting unrestrained trade as detrimental to his campaign.The progressives also look askew at the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, between the US, Canada, and Mexico because they say it’s done more harm than good to the American economy. Buttigieg has a similar concern, saying NAFTA led to the loss of many US jobs. Biden, meanwhile, is a full-throated supporter of the deal and voted to implement it in 1993.The ultimate test, though, may be each candidate’s stance on combating China’s aggressive trade practices. Warren and Sanders agree with Trump that China has hurt the US economy by manipulating currency and stealing American intellectual property. Both candidates have promised to fight back.“It’s wrong to pretend that China isn’t one of our major economic competitors,” Sanders tweeted in May. “When we are in the White House we will win that competition by fixing our trade policies.” He was actually responding to Biden’s comment in which he scoffed at the assertion that Beijing was truly an economic foe: China is “not competition for us,” the former vice president said. Buttigieg, meanwhile, considers the China challenge to be more about how its system of “authoritarian capitalism” is a threat to America’s way of life. “We also must be prepared to defend our values, interests, and relationships,” he said in his June foreign policy address.Which means much of the Democratic foreign policy debate will center on who likes free trade and who doesn’t, with a lot of “How do we deal with China?” sprinkled in. Some experts believe it’ll be the most bruising foreign policy fight in the campaign’s earliest days. But, they add, it’s surprising that there hasn’t been more discussion about it yet.“To me the key storyline so far is the relative silence on economics,” says Heather Hurlburt, a US foreign policy expert at the New America think tank in Washington, DC. “Warren and Sanders are trying to tug thinking on international issues around to an economics-first perspective, and the more centrist candidates just haven’t responded,” she continues. “The party is going to need to have another set of ideas around how economic and security policy connect.”Every Democratic candidate is likely to call for military restraint and an end to the yearslong war in Afghanistan and other military engagements around the world. The Democratic base (and many Trump supporters) is tired of the US fighting in the Middle East, Central Asia, and elsewhere.But the US president is also the military’s commander in chief, meaning candidates vying for that position must tussle over how they would oversee America’s armed forces.The likeliest fight will be on a deceivingly simple question: How much should the US spend on its military? For Sanders and Warren, the answer is simple: a lot less. They note that the US spends vastly more on defense than many nations combined, despite having few clear successes to show for it in recent decades. Reducing the military’s war chest, they say, would free up billions to spend on health care, education, and other areas while still leaving plenty left over to spend on security.That argument leads some experts to raise an eyebrow. “The progressives seem to be suggesting you can significantly cut the budget while confronting Russia and China, which is wishful thinking at best, at least if one looks at the next four years,” says Thomas Wright, a US foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in DC.Some of the more traditional foreign policy candidates, like Buttigieg, seem to agree. “Meeting the challenge of China means we must maintain investments in a military that can deter aggression and adventurism,” he said in his June foreign policy speech. And while Biden has not talked much about defense on the campaign trail, he did back Obama’s repeated calls to trim the military’s budget.It’s worth noting that no candidate in the race so far has talked very specifically about when they would use military force. Still, many will surely want to hear Democrats talk about how they’d deal with the critical foreign conflicts and crises the US currently faces.For example: Would any of the candidates vow to remove all US troops from Afghanistan by their first term? Will they pull all troops out of Iraq or Syria? Or will they say a residual force must remain to combat terrorists in the region? And how much money should the government spend on providing benefits to troops in uniform and veterans out of it?Democrats can’t avoid those questions forever.Israel and Palestine could prove another flashpoint for 2020 Democrats.Poll after poll has shown that liberal Democratic primary voters are less sympathetic to Israel than they were in years past. That may help explain why several candidates for the Democratic nomination are highly critical of Israel. Sanders, for example, has repeatedly condemned Israel for its actions on its border with Gaza, where, time and time again, Israeli forces have killed mostly unarmed protesters — including women and children — who are pleading for an end to the decade-long Israeli blockade of food, fuel, and medicine going into the Gaza Strip. And while Buttigieg has chastised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s leadership, he continues to call Israel a “strong ally” and has said he would keep the US Embassy in Jerusalem.Warren didn’t mention Israel or Palestine once in her foreign policy speech last year, but she refused to speak at a pro-Israel lobbying group’s DC conference this year (Buttigieg and Sanders also didn’t attend; Biden wasn’t yet in the race). That was widely seen as a rebuke to Netanyahu’s far-right government and Trump’s coziness with it.Biden hasn’t touched Israel on the stump, but the Obama administration’s relationship with the Jewish state was extremely frosty. He’ll no doubt say he supports the country — surely, all candidates will — but he may join his fellow candidates in speaking harshly about Netanyahu. In 2016, for example, Biden said he was “frustrated” with Netanyahu’s leadership.“I think every 2020 presidential contender will be asked how can they stand by Benjamin Netanyahu,” Waleed Shahid, the communications director for the progressive group Justice Democrats, told BuzzFeed News in January.It’s of course possible that many other foreign policy issues will arise during this week’s debates and over the many months before the election. But this early on, expect these three main areas to dominate the Democratic discussion on foreign affairs.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Poway and Pittsburgh: the rise in murderous anti-Semitism, explained",2019-05-01,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:A dangerous breed of  anti-Semitism, at once very old and very modern, is on the rise. Exactly six months apart, two different shooters went into American synagogues during services with an intent to kill Jews. The Pittsburgh shooting on October 27 claimed 11 lives, the worst act of anti-Semitic violence in American history. The Poway shooting on April 27  — the last day of Passover — claimed one, a woman named Lori Gilbert Kaye, who threw herself in front of the synagogue’s rabbi and saved his life.The attackers in both cases had something in common beyond a hatred for Jews: They were motivated by a very specific kind of anti-Semitic ideology, one focused on a fictional Jewish plot to destroy America by encouraging mass nonwhite immigration. Like the marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, who chanted “Jews will not replace us,” they believe that Jews are masterminding a plot to undermine white supremacy in America by bringing in literal boatloads of nonwhite migrants.This particular brand of anti-Semitism is both old and new. It’s old in the sense that anti-Semites, including Adolf Hitler, have long cast nonwhite migration to Western countries as a Jewish plot against the white race. It’s new in the sense that it flourishes and spreads on the internet, encouraging violence in a terrifyingly unpredictable fashion.It’s also “new” in the sense that it’s part of a broader rise in anti-Semitism in the United States since Donald Trump rose to power. Newly released data from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) shows that 2017 and 2018 saw two of the highest numbers of anti-Semitic incidents in nearly 40 years of ADL data, an increase experts say is at least partially linked to Trump’s demonization of immigrants and famous Jews (like George Soros) who advocate on their behalf.“We have a president who talks about ‘hordes’ and ‘swarms’ and all sorts of other things about immigrants,” says Deborah Lipstadt, a historian of anti-Semitism at Emory University. “This stuff has been around for a long time ... but now lots of the barriers are down, and now people feel like they can say it and they can do things.”This is not to say that anti-Semitism is an exclusive province of the right. Left-wing anti-Semitism is a real thing, even in the United States. But the kind of anti-Semitism that’s inspired two mass casualty attacks on synagogues to date is, in fact, a principally right-wing phenomenon. It arises not out of Israel-Palestine grievances, as left-wing anti-Semitism often does, but rather from distinctively right-wing forms of xenophobia and racial grievances.While both kinds of anti-Semitism need to be called out, it’s the right-wing variant that has actually taken lives. Yet in the wake of Poway, some conservatives have focused their critique on the left, a move that’s at once analytically inaccurate and morally misguided.This new right-wing anti-Semitism poses a dangerous threat to the American Jewish community — one that has Jews like me more scared for our community than we have been in my lifetime. It’s high time to treat it like the threat it is.Anti-Semitism is ancient. Lipstadt dates its Western variant back to the foundation of Christianity, specifically the early church idea that Jews were responsible for Jesus’s murder. Over the course of time, it has taken on a variety of guises. In 12th- and 13th-century England, Jews were blamed for several murders of young boys — an early version of the “blood libel,” the eventually common European theory that Jews kill young Christians and use their blood to make Passover matzo. The rise of scientific racism in the 19th and 20th centuries cemented the idea that Jews were a “race,” poisoning Western society by intermarrying with non-Jews and diluting their stock. “The cross between any of the three European races and a Jew is a Jew,” as infamous American scientific racist Madison Grant once wrote.These two examples show how anti-Semitism tends to adapt to its time, mutating to fit whatever the prominent political controversies and fault lines are. Two of those major fault lines today are immigration and multiculturalism.The man who attacked the Pittsburgh synagogue last October posted a short message on the far-right microblogging platform Gab explaining his motivation. He singled out the work of HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that has recently focused on bringing in refugees from places like Syria and Afghanistan, as his motivation for attacking a synagogue. “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” he wrote. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.”The Poway shooter distributed a lengthy manifesto to the virulently anti-Semitic troll web forum 8chan with similar themes.His diatribe is full of anti-Semitic grievance, with a surprisingly large number of references to classically Christian versions of anti-Semitism like collective Jewish responsibility for the murder of Jesus. But in the sections where he explains why he decided to target a synagogue specifically, he focuses on the same core idea as the Pittsburgh shooter, whom he repeatedly praises in the manifesto: the notion of Jews using nonwhites as weapons in their war on whites.“Every Jew is responsible for the meticulously planned genocide of the European race. They act as a unit, and every Jew plays his part to enslave the other races around him — whether consciously or subconsciously,” the Poway shooter writes. “[Latinos] and [blacks] are useful puppets for the Jew in terms of replacing Whites.”This particular variant on the Jewish puppet master trope is not novel. Hitler saw interwar African migration to France as a Jewish plot against whites. Some Southern segregationists, believing blacks too intellectually limited to lead the civil rights movement, posited Jews as its true masterminds.But the fact of mass nonwhite immigration to the West, which intensified significantly after World War II, has turned fears of so-called “white genocide” into the No. 1 concern of far-right political movements. Today’s fringe right is obsessed with the idea that whites are being destroyed by demography — that white countries are being “colonized” by the force of nonwhite breeding and immigration.“The term ‘white genocide,’” my colleague Jane Coaston notes, “is the single most popular hashtag used by white nationalists on Twitter.”So anti-Semitism, long a central part of the fringe right, adapted to fit this particular obsession with immigration and demographics. Modern right-wing anti-Semitism takes the ideas of Hitler and the segregationists and uses them as a kind of master explanation for why Western political systems are allowing “white genocide” to take place. You see propaganda to this effect in cesspools like the Daily Stormer and 8chan; it’s the reason the Charlottesville white nationalists chanted “Jews will not replace us!” as they marched with tiki torches.And now it has inspired two different men to shoot up synagogues.It feels like a cliché to say that all hate is linked, that all minority groups are victims when any of them is attacked. Yet a direct implication of the above analysis of anti-Semitism is that it’s true: Hate directed at other minority groups stokes anti-Semitism.When white nationalists agitate against African Americans, they blame Jews for advocating for civil rights. When white nationalists fret about Latino and Muslim migration leading to “white genocide,” they blame Jews for keeping the immigration system relatively open in the first place. When any minority group is demonized by the far right, it always seems to somehow ensnare Jews.You see this very explicitly in the Poway shooter’s manifesto. He repeatedly cites the Christchurch shooter, a man who killed 50 people at two mosques in New Zealand, as his inspiration. The New Zealand killer was also an 8chan denizen preoccupied by the notion of “white genocide,” and the Poway shooter saw attacks on mosques and synagogues as two sides of the same coin. He even claims to have set fire to a mosque in Escondido before attacking Poway’s Chabad synagogue, a crime with which police have just charged him.The Christchurch shooter “was a catalyst for me personally,” he writes. “He showed me that it could be done.”What this shows is that a political climate of generalized demonization of minorities ends up becoming one in which Jews become targets. The more angry people are about nonwhite immigrants, the more recruits the anti-Semitic fringe right gets — and the more of a threat they pose to Jews as a result.Which brings us to President Donald Trump.There is no doubt that the alt-right surged in popularity when Trump entered the race for the presidency — and then won. His demonization of Mexicans as rapists, his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country, and his use of language like “shithole countries” and “invasion” to demonize immigrants mainstreamed alt-right ideas. He retweeted outright white nationalist accounts (one of which was called “White GenocideTM”) and broadcast alt-right memes (like one with Hillary Clinton’s face next to a Jewish star). Around the same time as Trump’s rise, the ADL data shows the number of anti-Semitic incidents begin to rise again after declining and leveling off in previous years: The jump from 2016 to 2017 was, per the ADL, the largest single-year increase in the number of anti-Semitic incidents in its 40 years of collecting data. The report doesn’t break down incidents by ideology of the perpetrator, but a separate ADL research paper found that 49 of the 50 extremist murders in 2018 were committed by far-right extremists (rather than, for example, far-leftists or jihadists).It also so happens that the surge in anti-Semitism began as Trump’s fortunes rose politically — and it’s very hard not to conclude that there’s at least some connection there. This is certainly the sense of what’s happening in the Jewish community: A staggering 81 percent of American Jews describe themselves as becoming “more concerned” about anti-Semitism in the US since Trump took office, per a 2018 GBA Strategy poll conducted for the left-leaning Jewish group J Street.Now, it would be a mistake to blame Trump personally for any particular attack on Jews. The Poway shooter, for example, explicitly disparages Trump as “Zionist, Jew-loving, [and] anti-White.” The synagogue shooters weren’t immediately been inspired to violence by a Trump rally.It’s better, instead, to think of the relationship between the Trump presidency and anti-Semitic violence as something like the one between global warming and extreme weather events. We know that by transforming the underlying nature of our weather patterns, climate change makes catastrophes like hurricanes more likely in general. But blaming any particular hurricane on climate change is impossible, because you can’t really know whether or not the storm would have happened absent the underlying systemic change.Similarly, Trump has changed the underlying conditions of American politics. He has made virulent anti-immigrant sentiment more popular, attracted the support of far-right online political movements, and refused to credibly disavow these groups. Just days before the Poway shooting, he was still defending his “very fine people” comment about the Charlottesville “Jews will not replace us” marchers.These are conditions under which people are in general more likely to be attracted to the fringe right, and thus introduced to anti-Semitic ideas about who’s responsible for “white genocide.” Even if particular attacks can’t be blamed on Trump, the overall system under him is one in which Jews are far less safe than we used to be.“I think he’s an anti-Semitic enabler,” Lipstadt says. “He’s very careful not to criticize his followers. ... He’ll enable anything that’s going to get him elected or get him support.”None of this is to say that anti-Semitism is an exclusively right-wing problem.On the left today, there’s a serious problem with a slippage between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. Legitimate criticism of the Israeli government’s policy and character too often crosses the line into attacks on Jewish supporters of Israel, and even Jews in general.The British Labour Party, taken over by its left flank in 2015, has become a redoubt of such leftist anti-Semitism. Dozens of Labour elected officials, candidates, and party members have been caught giving voice to anti-Semitic comments. One municipal Labour official called Hitler “the greatest man in history” and added that “it’s disgusting how much power the Jews have in the US.” Another Labour candidate for office said “it’s the super rich families of the Zionist lobby that control the world.”The party received 673 complaints about anti-Semitism between April 2018 and January 2019 alone, an average of more than two complaints per day. Ninety-six Labour members were suspended for anti-Semitism during that time period, and 12 were outright expelled.In the United States, this is far less of a problem. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has said some things about Israel that have worrying resonances with anti-Semitic stereotypes. She has blamed pro-Israel groups for “allegiance to a foreign country” and claimed that money coming from such lobbying groups is responsible for America’s support for Israel. It’s not great stuff, and it can and should be called out when it crosses the line lest the American left degenerate to the level of its British peers. Yet in the United States, there is no credible evidence that the left is fueling the rise in anti-Semitic violence in the same way as the right is. A Somali immigrant like Omar is not stoking the kind of hate about migrants that fuels the “white genocide” conspiracy theory. She’s the kind of person the alt-right would like to see eliminated.And yet the reaction to Poway from some mainstream conservatives like Meghan McCain and Sen. Ted Cruz has been to bring up Omar, as if there’s some kind of relationship between her comments and the attack. Pundit Ben Shapiro grotesquely suggested that Omar has “a lot of the same opinions about Jews that the white supremacist had in that manifesto.”One of the problems with anti-Semitism is that it’s pan-ideological, with examples of it cropping up on both sides of the political aisle. That makes it really easy to focus on the one coming from your opponents — everyone can talk about the anti-Semitism that’s politically convenient while ignoring the one that isn’t. It was a bad look when some Democrats and leftists did it after Omar’s comments; it’s a bad look now that conservatives and Trump supporters are doing it after Poway.But the very comparison between those two things shows that the problem truly is worse on the right than it is on the left, at least in the United States.The deadly anti-Semitic violence in America is coming from one side, with real and demonstrable connections to the way the leader of the Republican Party talks and thinks. Though the Poway shooter may have disavowed Trump, the alt-right in general loves him. They think they have a friend in the White House, and their online rhetoric reflects that. It’s not deflection to say that this is much, much scarier than Omar’s poorly phrased comments about the pro-Israel lobby. You can believe that Omar’s comments were bad, that they could help normalize certain anti-Semitic stereotypes, and that the anti-Semitism from the right, steeped in white supremacy, is the real threat to Jewish lives.This is a truly scary time for American Jews. A 2018 American Jewish Council survey found that a majority of Jews feel “less secure” in the United States than they did one year ago. I certainly fall into that group.America, a country that so many Jews have seen as a safe haven from European anti-Semitism, has now seen two synagogue shootings in six months — alongside a significant surge in anti-Semitic harassment and assault. The recent march of white nationalism has fundamentally destabilized Jewish life in this country, making us wonder whether this place really is as different as we’d like to think. It’s a fear that could very well outlast Trump’s presidency.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The Ilhan Omar anti-Semitism controversy, explained",2019-03-06,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Why her comments about “allegiance” to Israel created such a firestorm — and why it all matters.The long-simmering controversy over Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN)’s heated language on Israel has reached a boiling point — with House Democrats weighing a plan to vote on a resolution clearly designed to punish one of their own rising stars.Omar had already stirred controversy with comments last month attributing pro-Israel sentiment to the financial clout of the pro-Israel lobby. Then last week, she spoke about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on a panel with Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), who, like Omar, is a first-term member of Congress and a Muslim. “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country,” Omar said as part of a discussion about past anti-Semitism allegations lobbed at her.In full context, Omar doesn’t explicitly identify who or what this “political influence” is coming from other than the pro-Israel lobbying community in general. But given her previous comments, the latest remarks struck many observers as playing into well-worn anti-Semitic tropes about Jewish attachments to Israel making them disloyal to the United States. Some were no longer inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. On Monday, House Democrats unveiled plans to vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism that reads as a clear rebuke of Omar personally, criticizing the “insidious, bigoted history” of “accusations of dual loyalty.”Yet Omar also has vocal defenders in both the Democratic Party and the broader left-progressive community, including some prominent Jewish leftists. Her defenders argue she is being attacked in bad faith as a Muslim woman of color who dares to criticize Israel, pointing out that anti-Semitism on the right doesn’t get nearly this much attention. Nor, they argue, does Islamophobia get taken as seriously: Just this week, Republicans in the West Virginia Legislature put up a viciously Islamophobic poster connecting Omar to the 9/11 hijackers, without nearly as much fanfare as Omar’s comparatively tame comments.   This backlash, particularly from progressive members of Congress, appears to have caused Democrats to delay the vote on the anti-Semitism resolution — and potentially rewrite its text entirely.It’s true that Omar’s comments on Israel keep falling into well-worn anti-Semitic tropes — and her defenders often prove too willing to paper this over and dismiss criticism from even progressive Jews as “smears.”It’s also the case that Republican officials frequently call on anti-Semitic tropes and say worse about other minority groups without nearly so much bipartisan condemnation. Pushing for a House vote on anti-Semitism really did feel like unfairly singling out Omar — and whitewashing the GOP’s record in the process. That’s why progressives rallied to Omar’s defense, and why the Democratic leadership has been forced to reconsider its initial resolution.In short, the entire situation is a mess — and an example of how difficult it is for Democrats to carry on an important conversation about anti-Semitism on the left without downplaying the far more pressing problem of anti-Semitism on the right.Ilhan Omar is widely seen as one of the rising stars in the 2018 legislative class. She has an inspiring story — a refugee from Somalia who rose to become the first black Muslim woman in Congress — and has demonstrated a talent for giving voice to perspectives often excluded from mainstream American politics. Her grilling of Venezuela envoy Elliott Abrams last month shined a spotlight on American complicity in grave human rights abuses in America, a kind of critique of the foreign policy elite rarely heard from members of Congress.Her stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — unapologetically pro-Palestinian — fits with this profile, broadly speaking. It has helped make her into a darling of the insurgent left, which is highly critical of the Democratic establishment’s generically pro-Israel view. Yet when Omar talks about Israel, she has a bad habit of saying things that feed into anti-Semitic stereotypes.In 2012, she tweeted that “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” The tweet implied that Israel and its supporters were secretly tricking the world into supporting it, a longtime anti-Semitic trope for which Omar apologized after taking office in January. “I heard from Jewish orgs. that my use of the word ‘hypnotize’ and the ugly sentiment it holds was offensive,” she tweeted. “I spent ... little energy [in] disavowing the anti-Semitic trope I unknowingly used, which is unfortunate and offensive.” In mid-February, Omar created another stir when she tweeted that support for Israel in the US Congress was “all about the Benjamins,” suggesting that the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC was buying off American politicians. This smacked of the well-worn conspiracy theory that Jewish financiers buy off American politicians, and led to Democratic leadership publicly condemning Omar’s comments. Omar deleted the original tweet and said she “unequivocally” apologized. And for a few weeks, that seemed to settle the matter. But then, at the panel with Tlaib last Wednesday, Omar tried to address her anti-Semitism problem again. And that’s when things went south.Omar’s remarks at the panel did acknowledge, to be clear, that it’s important to be sensitive when Jews take offense at her comments. But she also suggests that being Muslim leads to the assumption of anti-Semitism, and that the accusation is used as a label to shut down debate.Then she concludes with the instantly infamous comments about “allegiance” to Israel. Here’s the full quote: What I’m fearful of — because Rashida [Tlaib] and I are Muslim — that a lot of our Jewish colleagues, a lot of our constituents, a lot of our allies, go to thinking that everything we say about Israel to be anti-Semitic because we are Muslim. And so to me, it’s something that becomes designed to end the debate because you get in this space of — yes, I know what intolerance looks like and I’m sensitive when someone says, “The words you used, Ilhan, are resemblance [sic] of intolerance.” And I am cautious of that and I feel pained by that. But it’s almost as if, every single time we say something regardless of what it is we say that is supposed to be about foreign policy or engagement or advocacy about ending oppression or the freeing of every human life and wanting dignity, we get to be labeled something, and that ends the discussion. Because we end up defending that and nobody ever gets to have the broader debate of what is happening with Palestine. So for me, I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country. And I want to ask, why is it okay for me to talk about the influence of the NRA, of fossil fuel industries, or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobby?It’s an extremely fraught answer.It is true that pro-Israel lobbying groups like AIPAC push American policy in a pro-Israel direction. But they are not all-important — US-Israel ties run a lot deeper from lobbying money — but the evidence suggests they clearly have clout, particularly on Capitol Hill.Moreover, the charge of anti-Semitism really is used to immunize Israel from any criticism at times: As someone who is both Jewish and a critic of the Israeli government’s occupation of Palestinian land, I can’t count the number of times I’ve been called an anti-Semite or a self-hating Jew. A Muslim member of Congress is far more likely to be targeted by unfair accusations like this.And Omar’s most fundamental point — that it would be better to talk about the underlying issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than nitpicking her language — is reasonable. The irony is that her own word choice is what causes this problem: By using charged language on a tremendously sensitive topic, she ends up distracting from the conversation she really wants to start.The use of the word “allegiance” in reference to Israel — particularly in context of the activities of the heavily Jewish pro-Israel lobbying world — is a touchy subject for good reason: It touches on age-old anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an infamous early-20th-century Russian forgery, describes a plot by Jewish moneyed interests to subvert and destroy Christian societies through their finances. This in turn draws on a deeper European anti-Semitic tradition that portrays Jews as not just greedy but fundamentally disloyal — working to subvert Western societies from the inside for their own nefarious ends. It’s a line you heard not only from Nazis but also World War II-era American anti-Semites like Charles Lindbergh.After the war and the creation of the state of Israel, anti-Semites started using Jewish activism in favor of the Jewish state as proof that they were right all along about diaspora Jews being disloyal to their home countries. David Duke, the former Louisiana state representative and Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, released a YouTube video in 2014 titled “The Illustrated Protocols of Zion.” The video’s core thesis is that the forgery was essentially true — that today, the work of Zionist groups like AIPAC is proof that there really is a disloyal Jewish conspiracy.“The Protocols of Zion could have just as easily been titled The Protocols of Zionism,” Duke says. “The modern elders are leaders of Zionism ... hundreds of Zionist organizations across the world, that are funded with tens of billions of dollars, are used to promote the interests of Zionist Israel and what they see as the collective interests of the Jewish people.”Omar is, of course, not coming from the same hateful place as Duke, and equating them would be absurd. I can’t emphasize that point enough: They are not at all the same, or even in the same ballpark. In a statement emailed to me, her spokesperson Jeremy Slevin emphasized that she did not mean to imply anything about the Jewish community writ large.“At the event last week, Rep. Omar reiterated the remorse she feels for her comments last month—and the pain she knows they caused. As she said in her apology, we must distinguish between criticism of a particular faith and fair critiques of lobbying groups,” Slevin said. “She has consistently spoken out about the undue influence of lobbying groups for foreign interests of all kinds and her comments were about just that. To suggest otherwise is an inaccurate reading of her remarks.”But intent aside, her language is unintentionally providing mainstream cover for Duke’s brand of conspiracy theorizing — as he was quick to point out. “Omar is right ... about Israel,” he tweeted after the news of her panel remarks broke.If you’re not careful when talking about pro-Israel lobbying, you can provide ammunition to some awful people. By suggesting that pro-Israel lobbying constitutes a push for “allegiance” to a foreign country, Omar was suggesting that an activity disproportionately conducted by Jews is essentially disloyal, making a fundamentally anti-Semitic idea more acceptable to voice on the left.“She may think she is only criticizing Israel and its policies,” Deborah Lipstadt, an Emory University professor and leading scholar of anti-Semitism, told Jewish Insider. “But one cannot ignore the fact that she is relying on traditional anti-Semitic tropes to do so.”There’s a real dilemma here. Pro-Palestinian activists, writers, and politicians have every right to point out what they see as the pernicious influence of groups like AIPAC. Pro-Israel lobbying groups are undeniably powerful, and it’s worth mentioning in our conversations about both Israel policy and money in politics. You can and should be able to say that “lobbying pushes America’s Israel policy in a hawkish pro-Israel direction” without implying that heavily Jewish groups are literally trying to make American politicians pledge allegiance to a foreign entity.At the same time, there is a special need on the left — where most pro-Palestinian sentiment resides — to be careful about just how you discuss those things. If references to Jews’ baleful influence on Israel policy become too flip, too easy, things can go really wrong.To see a real example, one need only to look at Britain.In British left-wing and pro-Palestinian circles, derogatory comments about the political clout of Israel and “Zionists” have become quite common. When left-wing insurgent Jeremy Corbyn won the center-left Labour Party’s leadership in 2015, the people who inhabited these spaces seized control of the party power centers.Corbyn, who had once referred to members of Hamas and Hezbollah as his “friends,” opened the floodgates for the language of Labour’s left flank to go mainstream. The result is a three-year roiling scandal surrounding anti-Semitism in the party.Dozens of Labour elected officials, candidates, and party members have been caught giving voice to anti-Semitic comments. One municipal Labour official called Hitler “the greatest man in history” and added that “it’s disgusting how much power the Jews have in the US.” Another Labour candidate for office said “it’s the super rich families of the Zionist lobby that control the world.” The party received 673 complaints about anti-Semitism between April 2018 and January 2019 alone, an average of more than two complaints per day. Ninety-six Labour members were suspended for anti-Semitism during that time period, and 12 were outright expelled.Today, about 85 percent of British Jews believe there are “high” levels of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and that Corbyn himself is anti-Semitic. Almost 40 percent of Jews say they would “seriously consider” leaving the country if Labour wins the next parliamentary election. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi of Britain, recently warned that British Jews feel “an existential threat” from Corbyn’s Labour Party.This is why Omar’s tweet was so troubling. If the line doesn’t get drawn somewhere, the results for Jews — who still remain a tiny, vulnerable minority — can be devastating.Last weekend, as the outrage surrounding Omar’s comments grew, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) tweeted something equally, if not more, offensive. He blasted Jewish Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) for jumping “to Tom $teyer’s conclusion” — a reference to major Democratic donor Tom Steyer, who has a Jewish father. In essence, he implied that a Jewish rep is doing the bidding of Jewish money — a suggestion that Nadler blasted as “inane and anti-Semitic.” Yet Jordan’s comments haven’t driven the national news cycle, or caused the House majority to write up resolutions condemning him. He just sort of skated by, part of a broader problem of Republican impunity for using anti-Semitic stereotypes. Indeed, one of the key differences between the United States and Britain is that in the US, anti-Semitic tropes are far more common on the right than the left.Take House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who attacked Omar and Tlaib even before the latest rounds of controversy began. Last summer, McCarthy posted a tweet accusing three Steyer and two other Democratic billionaires of Jewish descent — George Soros and Michael Bloomberg — of trying to buy the midterm election:In 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump once told a room full of Jewish Republicans that “you’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money,” adding that “you want to control your politicians, that’s fine.” In 2016, Trump released a campaign ad that played a quote from one of his speeches over footage of George Soros and former Fed Chair Janet Yellen (also Jewish) that comes across as an anti-Semitic dog whistle.“For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don’t have your good in mind,” Trump said.Just this past week, Trump called Jewish Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) “shifty,” a comment playing on his last name but also on the history of Jews being described as crafty and sneaky manipulators. This all creates a stunning contrast, as the progressive Jewish writer Peter Beinart points out:Just randomly overheard @realDonaldTrump on @CNN call @RepAdamSchiff ""little shifty Schiff."" Doubt it will even make the papers. Think for a second what would have happened if @IlhanMN or @RashidaTlaib had said that. Then ask yourselves what explains the double standardIndeed, observers of anti-Semitism in the US generally believe that right-wing demonization of Jews is the much bigger problem. Republicans have gone after Soros in particular for years, with politicians and GOP-aligned media creating a narrative in which he and other left-wing Jews are puppet masters, using their money to undermine America from within. And they are engaging in the same normalization of Protocols-style anti-Semitic tropes as Omar.The most dangerous kind of rising anti-Semitism in America is associated with the online alt-right, not the pro-Palestinian left. These people, Trump fans whom the president has done little to distance himself from, harass and threaten Jewish journalists and public figures. This is where David Duke — who served in the Louisiana Legislature as a Republican — feels comfortable. This is the milieu from which the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter emerged.Yet Republicans are attacking Omar and demanding Democrats punish her. Trump, for instance, has repeatedly attacked Omar — even calling on her to resign from Congress. It is exceptionally hard to see these critiques as good-faith concern about the mainstreaming of anti-Semitic tropes. In fact, it’s hard to see them as anything but a cynical attempt to marginalize a left-wing Muslim and woman of color and foster internal division in the Democratic caucus.And this is the problem with the anti-Semitism resolution Democrats initially planned to introduce.The draft text, as reported by Politico on Monday, did not mention Omar by name. It condemns anti-Semitism in the abstract and touches on other forms of bigotry, including even “unfounded, vicious attacks on and threats to Muslim-American Members of Congress.” But despite that line, the context of the past week of political conversation makes it clear that the resolution is targeting Omar, a way of distancing the Democratic leadership from her and publicly chastising her.This resolution would have played right into GOP hands. It would allow them to say that Democrats are going after Omar, and to vote in favor of a resolution condemning anti-Semitism without seriously policing their own on the problem. The fact that some Democrats may have voted against the resolution as a gesture of solidarity with Omar could give them further ammunition to paint Democrats as the party with the anti-Semitism problem, when in fact its leadership has been quick to criticize Omar’s comments.There’s a fine line between legitimate self-policing, militating against a UK-style disaster, and helping Republicans smear a Muslim member of Congress they don’t like. The House resolution, however well-intentioned, initially put Democrats on the wrong side of it.But things changed. The Democratic leadership, under pressure from progressive groups and officials like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), appears to be postponing the vote till at least Thursday. They’re currently planning to revise the resolution to make it less of an implicit condemnation of Omar, or even rewrite it entirely. “A draft resolution would be updated to include additional language rejecting anti-Muslim bias, although some Democratic sources believe that an entirely new document might be crafted,” Politico reports.This is a victory for Omar. It’s a sign that she has significant support in the party, and that leadership isn’t willing to throw her under the bus entirely. A lot, however, still depends on the fate of the resolution: what it ends up looking like, or if it gets introduced at all.Whether Democrats can land on a balance that respects two vital but competing imperatives — addressing real issues of anti-Semitism and defusing a malicious GOP campaign against Omar — remains to be seen.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Is the US-Israel alliance doomed?,2021-05-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Israel is an increasingly partisan issue — a development that threatens the foundations of the US-Israel alliance.Throughout the Gaza conflict, President Joe Biden has been about as supportive of Israel as its leaders could have hoped. He has issued statements supporting its “right to self-defense,” blocked UN Security Council resolutions calling for a ceasefire, and even chose to move forward with a previously approved US arms sale to Israel worth $735 million.In short, it seems like the US-Israel alliance is as strong as ever. But beneath the surface, there are signs that the relationship isn’t what it once was. Despite Biden’s firm stance, the US and Israel may be heading for a divorce in the long run.The most visible of these signs is the rising discontent with Israel among progressive Democrats in Congress. The left flank of the party, represented by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has been unsparingly critical of Israel — with Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in the House, like Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib (who is of Palestinian descent), calling Israel an “apartheid state.” But even some more centrist Democrats with strong pro-Israel bona fides are taking a harder stance. Rep. Greg Meeks (NY), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, initially called for a pause on the new arms sale; Sen. Robert Menendez (NJ), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has suggested Israel is not taking enough care to avoid killing civilians in Gaza.“If you don’t follow congressional statements on this stuff over time, it is really hard to explain how remarkable this is,” writes Yousef Munayyer, a nonresident fellow at the Arab Center think tank in Washington, DC. The Democratic position on Gaza reflects a long-running process of partisan polarization of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The US-Israel alliance, which has its origins in Cold War geopolitics, has been a bipartisan endeavor for decades. But a series of factors — including the actions of specific leaders like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and deeper political trends in both countries — has created a partisan imbalance. Republicans have become more pro-Israel than ever, while Democrats are becoming more and more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.“People are becoming increasingly aware of the indefensible human rights situation on the ground in Gaza,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) told me via email. “This includes a diverse coalition of progressive Jewish-Americans, Muslim-Americans and others who see our humanity as directly tied to one another.”Historically, the cornerstone of the US-Israel alliance has been bipartisan support — both on Capitol Hill and among the American public. You need both parties to continue approving US aid to Israel in Congress; you need policy continuity in the White House to ensure unchanging US support in international forums like the UN. The more partisan Israel becomes, the weaker the alliance gets.Unless something fundamental changes, it’s easy to see how the US-Israel alliance could continue to unravel in the long term. Biden may be the last Democratic president to give Israel a blank check during a war.Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday.The US and Israel weren’t always close allies. When Israel (along with France and Britain) invaded Egypt in 1956, the United States condemned the Israel attack. And the US actively worked against Israel’s clandestine nuclear program for years.Even when the US did come to support Israel, it was more about cold strategic calculation than anything else. American presidents and strategists came to see Israel as a useful tool for containing Soviet influence in the Middle East, which was significant among Arab states, and used its diplomatic and military support to weave Israel firmly into the capitalist bloc.This strategic justification came down with the Berlin Wall. Yet US aid to Israel kept flowing after the Cold War, as did diplomatic support — propelled largely by US policy toward the Middle East and American domestic politics.In the post-Cold War era, the US saw itself as a guarantor of regional peace and stability in the Middle East — even, and perhaps especially, when it upset that stability through actions like the invasion of Iraq. In its self-appointed role as Middle East manager, Washington cultivated alliances with some of the region’s status-quo-oriented powers — places like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Israel.Moreover, every post-Cold War president through Barack Obama saw solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a priority for Middle East policy, believing (to varying degrees) that solving the conflict was both a moral imperative and important for improving regional political dynamics. America’s alliance with Israel was supposed to help, positioning the US as one of the only international brokers Israelis felt like they could trust. But US domestic politics was equally important. Polling data shows that, for the past several decades, supporting Israel has been popular with a clear majority of American voters. Key constituencies in both parties — Jews on the Democratic side, evangelicals on the Republican side — have been especially vocal in Israel’s defense, willing to devote resources and activist demonstrations to support pro-Israel policies.Historically, Israel’s image as “the only democracy in the Middle East” has been especially important in cementing the American pro-Israel consensus — giving a sense that America wasn’t just justified in supporting Israel, but obligated to do so in order to defend a beleaguered democracy. “It is the existence of a shared identity and transnational values that is the foundation of this relationship,” Michael Barnett, a professor at George Washington University, wrote in 1996.But in recent years, these foundations have started to crack. At both the elite and public level, Americans have become skeptical of the strategic wisdom of deep involvement in the Middle East. The Biden administration has sought to deemphasize US involvement in the region, reflecting the rising consensus that it’s been a quagmire distracting America from the more pressing challenges posed by a rising China. Simply put: Maintaining strong relations with Middle Eastern allies like Israel is seen as less important to America than it was in the recent past.At the same time, the public consensus that the US should take an unconditional pro-Israel stance has weakened. A March 2021 Gallup poll found that, for the first time in nearly 15 years of polling, a majority of Democrats favored “putting more pressure on Israel” to make compromises for peace with the Palestinians.It’s this last trend that should particularly trouble policymakers in Jerusalem: They need Democratic support to keep the aid flowing and ensure strong diplomatic support in bodies like the UN. But there are deep reasons behind the growing Democratic skepticism about Israel — ones that are likely to widen the divide rather than narrow it in the coming years.The most significant reason for a widening gap between Israel and the Democratic Party is also the easiest to grasp: The center of Israeli politics has moved far to the right as Democrats have moved to the left.The Israeli left’s public support plummeted in the early 2000s, after the peace process it had championed collapsed into the violence of the Second Intifada — the bloodiest conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in decades. When Benjamin Netanyahu became prime minister in 2009, he and his Likud party continued to move to the right — reflecting fundamental changes in Israel’s political center of gravity.The center-left Labor party, historically the dominant force in Israeli elections, now holds a mere seven of 120 seats in the Knesset (parliament). The left is so weak that, prior to the Gaza war, it was ready to agree to a deal that would hand the premiership to Naftali Bennett — a far-right firebrand who wants to annex parts of the West Bank.Israel’s occupation of the West Bank has deepened significantly under Netanyahu, with settlements expanding at rapid rates in the past 10 years. The justification that shielded Israel from charges of operating an “apartheid state” — that the occupation was temporary, to end with the creation of an independent Palestine — has become harder to maintain.All of these developments have undermined the traditional values-based argument for US support for Israel that has been crucial to maintaining the alliance in the post-Cold War era. “We’ve always been for two states. Still are,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) wrote on Twitter. “The defining ‘shift’ has been that the Netanyahu government and the Republicans have effectively abandoned the idea of a viable Palestinian state.”But it’s not only Israel that’s changed: Democrats are also considerably more progressive than they used to be.The median Democrat is more left-wing across the board than they were even 10 years ago. And there’s some evidence that the constituencies that make up an increasingly large share of the Democratic Party — African Americans, Latinos, and younger voters — are less sympathetic to Israel than the general population. Jewish Democrats, that traditional bastion of American pro-Israel sentiment, have soured on Israel under Netanyahu: A Pew survey released in May found that nearly twice as many Jewish Democrats believe the US is “too supportive” of Israel than believe it’s “not supportive enough.” J Street, the liberal pro-Israel lobby that supports increasing pressure on Israel to end the occupation of Palestinian territory, regularly attracts leading Democratic politicians to their annual conference. Many also boycott a similar event by AIPAC, J Street’s more powerful and more rigidly pro-Israel cousin.Moreover, two political tendencies with pro-Palestinian bents — democratic socialism and social justice activism — have become more ideologically influential inside the party. In left-wing circles, support for Israel is often described as support for imperialism and white supremacy. There’s a reason critics of Israel in the House like Omar have used the phrase “Palestinian lives matter” in discussing the current crisis: It’s pressing on the Democratic attachment to Israel at of one its weakest points. Democrats and Israel are just in drastically different political places, and it makes a once-natural connection much harder to sustain.The notion of a weakening US-Israel alliance might sound fuzzy, maybe even fanciful. How can you describe an alliance that still leads to billions of military aid every year as one under stress?Yet a closer look at the past 10 years reveals places where the bipartisan consensus on Israel has started to crack. And much of the blame, ironically enough, can be laid on two of Israel’s most prominent advocates — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former President Donald Trump. The two men have worked deliberately to polarize the US-Israel relationship, identifying Israel’s cause with the Republican Party’s. Their behavior was both cause and consequence of the alliance’s weakening: consequence in the sense that they were partially reacting to a perceived Democratic drift away from Israel; cause in that they significantly exacerbated said drift — which would not have happened at the same pace without them.Netanyahu clashed with Obama repeatedly throughout their mutual time in office, frequently on the peace process and settlement construction. Their personal relationship was famously icy; one senior Obama aide once told a reporter that Netanyahu was a “chickenshit.”Of course, allies disagree with each other on policy all the time, even bitterly: Think about the bitter spat between the United States and France in the run-up to the Iraq war. But Netanyahu escalated his feud with Obama far beyond normal disagreement, taking actions that functionally aligned the government of Israel with Obama’s domestic opponents — the Republican Party.During the 2012 election, Netanyahu all but openly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney in his bid to unseat President Obama. In 2015, Netanyahu worked with congressional Republicans to orchestrate a speech to a joint session of Congress opposing the Iran nuclear deal — an effort to help Republicans whip votes for legislation undoing Obama’s signature foreign policy accomplishment.From Netanyahu’s point of view, the strategy of meddling in US politics on the Republican side made sense. He thought Obama’s efforts to limit settlement growth and bargain with Iran was damaging to Israel; allying with Republicans was his best bet for countering what he saw as hostile behavior.But at the same time, picking sides so aggressively in your ally’s domestic politics shows a lack of confidence in the alliance itself: a sense that the relationship’s health is conditional on which faction is in power. Netanyahu’s actions reflected not only specific disagreements with Obama, but a feeling that the Democratic Party as currently constituted couldn’t be trusted to safeguard Israel’s interests.Democrats, for their part, have viewed Israel far more negatively in opinion polling after Netanyahu’s meddling than before it. If the structural trends pushing Democrats and Israel apart were a low-grade fire, the prime minister dumped gasoline on it.“I think [rising partisanship on Israel] had a lot to do with the prime minister playing a critical role in lobbying the US Congress on the Iran deal,” Shibley Telhami, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies American attitudes toward Israel, told the Times of Israel in 2018. “You have a right-wing government in Israel, and that government is seen to have embraced the Republican Party in the US.”During the Trump presidency, the identification of Israel with the GOP accelerated further. Netanyahu embraced Trump, going so far as to put up giant campaign posters in Israel with his face on them. Trump, for his part, publicly embraced the Israeli right — appointing a far-right ideologue ambassador to Israel, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, leaving the Iran nuclear deal, and proposing a “peace plan” that gave the Israeli right everything it wanted.While this may have seemed like a deepening of the US-Israel relationship, it actually served to factionalize the alliance further: to make “supporting Israel” into something that Republicans do, a position aligned with the most hated man in Democratic politics. It helped open the floodgates for the congressional criticism we’re seeing now.“Donald Trump politicized US support of Israel,” Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, told my colleague Alex Ward.Partisanship is the most powerful force in American politics today. Once an issue becomes understood in two-party terms, partisans of each faction feel powerful psychological pressures to line up on opposite sides. Netanyahu and Trump made conscious choices to reframe Israel in these terms, thinking that it would benefit their own political positions and advance their own policy priorities. But now we’re seeing the longer-term consequences. A Democratic Party already set up to be skeptical of an alliance with Israel is growing rapidly more skeptical of Jerusalem’s good intentions.So far, it looks like Biden is the most significant short-term force standing in the way of this realignment. It’s not exactly clear why he’s coming down so firmly on Israel’s side, but so far the gap between him and congressional Democrats is fairly striking.Then again, Trump’s early Israel policy was much more moderate than the right-wing position he embraced later in his term. It’s possible that, down the line, Biden will adjust to the new Democratic consensus on Israel in the way that he’s adjusted to the party’s more progressive stances on race and economics. But even if that doesn’t happen, policies that used to get unanimous votes in Congress — approving US foreign aid to Israel, resolutions supporting Israel’s right to self-defense — will no longer sail through without controversy. Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN) introduced a bill earlier this year putting human rights conditions on US aid to Israel. It has 19 co-sponsors and has been endorsed by J Street.When I spoke to Matt Duss, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s foreign policy adviser and a veteran Israel-Palestine policy hand, he told me that this weakening of the alliance is inevitable only “if Israel continues on the current political trajectory.” It’s Israel’s leadership that has chosen to expand the settlements and respond to Hamas rockets with such overwhelming force; it’s Israel’s prime minister who chose to align his country with the factional interests of the Republican Party. If Israel’s leadership undoes those choices and moves to a different path, the cracks in the US-Israel alliance could plausibly be repaired.So that’s the big question: Is Israel capable of and willing to change? Or is it really willing to sacrifice its relationship with the world’s only superpower on the altar of permanent occupation?

Journalists can tweet about Black Lives Matter but not about Palestine,2021-05-26,Vox,['Peter Kafka'],"Filed under:Newsrooms are debating, in real time, what’s okay to say out loud and what you’re supposed to keep in your head. Ask Emily Wilder.Last week, no one had heard of Emily Wilder. Then she became the focus of a national campaign to get her fired. Days later, she was.Things move fast. So there’s a good chance that days from now, the story of a rookie journalist who lost her job because of the way she used social media to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, will have faded from the discourse. Her firing will become just another bullet point in future stories about “cancel culture” on the right and left.On the other hand: I have a hunch that the particular circumstances of Wilder’s narrative will have more resonance than your standard Outrage of the Week. Because it merges two storylines — the long-running, intractable standoff between Israelis and Palestinians, and the newer, intractable fight over fairness and objectivity in journalism that is being hashed out on Twitter and in Slack rooms and in the real world. What do fairness and objectivity in journalism really mean? And do those two ideas have to be linked at the hip? That is: Can you be fair in your reporting but abandon “the unreasonable and hideously stupid expectation that reporters must harbor no strong opinions about the things they care about,” as journalist Laura Wagner put it in Defector?Answers that might have made sense a few years ago don’t seem to work anymore, so journalists, their bosses, and their readers are coming up with answers on the fly — and, in this case, failing miserably. First, the chronology, as relayed by Wilder in press interviews and via Twitter:The AP says it fired Wilder for violating the company’s social media policy while employed there — that is, not for tweets she made prior to getting hired — but wouldn’t spell out specific infractions. A rep passed along this statement: While AP generally refrains from commenting on personnel matters, we can confirm Emily Wilder’s comments on Thursday that she was dismissed for violations of AP’s social media policy during her time at AP. We have this policy so the comments of one person cannot create dangerous conditions for our journalists covering the story. Every AP journalist is responsible for safeguarding our ability to report on this conflict, or any other, with fairness and credibility, and cannot take sides in public forums.So we’re left to guess at Wilder’s supposed infractions. The most likely candidate is this May 16 tweet — posted the day before the Stanford College Republicans went after her — critiquing the way mainstream media covers the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Which presumably conflicts with the AP’s policy that “employees must refrain from declaring their views on contentious public issues in any public forum.”Wilder has also retweeted several other tweets about the conflict, and the AP says that “Retweets, like tweets, should not be written in a way that looks like you’re expressing a personal opinion on the issues of the day. A retweet with no comment of your own can easily be seen as a sign of approval of what you’re relaying ... unadorned retweets must be avoided.”But let’s be clear: Wilder was working out of the AP’s Phoenix newsroom, half a world away from its former offices in Gaza, which were destroyed this month by Israeli airstrikes. Firing her doesn’t “safeguard” the AP’s ability to report on the conflict in any way. All of this tweet-parsing is ridiculous and shameful. The most charitable explanation is that her managers really didn’t like a handful of tweets their new hire had made — which is something they could resolve without firing her. But firing her days after she became the target of a political campaign is an explicit capitulation, and a green light for other groups to target other journalists with similar efforts — which they most certainly will. It’s worth noting that we still haven’t heard directly from anyone at the AP about its side of the story in any detail. In a memo distributed to AP employees this weekend, executives wrote that “much of the coverage and commentary does not accurately portray what took place,” but didn’t offer their own version of events.But if the premise of the AP’s actions is that the appearance of wrongdoing is as important as the act itself, then the AP is the guilty party here: It’s signaled that it will throw its journalists under the bus at a moment’s notice if people on Twitter complain loudly enough.  And while the AP has told employees it intends to have an internal “conversation” about its social media policy, my hunch is that it’s still going to be fundamentally uncomfortable with a point of view common among journalists in 2021 — which is that they have points of view, and pretending otherwise is dishonest.Wilder’s firing is one inflection point in a complex and evolving debate about journalistic objectivity that’s usually addressed sideways, rather than head-on. It highlights the strain newsrooms in the US are experiencing as they try to figure out how to tell journalists what beliefs they can express publicly. And which ones they’re either not supposed to have or that they’re supposed to pretend not to have.Consider: Last year, in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, Americans on social media aligned, at least temporarily, behind the Black Lives Matter moment. There were few willing to defend the actions of the Minneapolis police officers who killed him or didn’t stop his murder. And social media services were bursting with people proclaiming their opposition to systemic racism and support for the Black Lives Matter movement — a movement that had been considered left-of-mainstream just a few years earlier. That momentum swept up middle-of-the-road mega-companies, like Walmart and Amazon. And it definitely included newsrooms, including my own: Last June, Vox.com managers sent out a memo reminding us that Vox journalists aren’t supposed to participate in political rallies, and to “refrain from using hashtags associated with movements and organizations we are actively covering, or publicly endorsing them.” That said, the memo added: “Racism is not a ‘both sides’ issue, and employees are free to speak out against racism and inequality.” It was a major shift.In the recent past, some mainstream journalists would announce, in public, that they didn’t vote because they didn’t want their work to be biased — or because they wanted to prevent anyone, ever, from accusing them of bias. And some of that thinking still, amazingly, exists. But it’s wildly out of step with the present moment, where debates about ideology and politics have been replaced with debates between facts and fiction. Half of Republicans, for instance, believe that the Capitol Riot “was largely a non-violent protest or was the handiwork of left-wing activists ‘trying to make Trump look bad.’” And that’s a story that requires no work at all to understand — you have to work hard not to comprehend what happened on January 6.  But when it comes to Israel and Palestine, there’s nothing like that kind of clarity, even among people who generally see the world the same way you do: Declare your support for children killed by Israeli artillery in Gaza, and you may find your Slackmate or Instagram followers have a lot to say about Hamas rockets aimed at Israel, or about a spike in anti-Semitic attacks worldwide since the most recent conflict. Or, just as likely, you may hear an uncomfortable silence. And my hunch is that those responses may surprise a younger generation of journalists. Israelis and Palestinians have been fighting for decades, but we haven’t seen much of the conflict unfold during the social media age that really started in the 2010s, years after the last full-scale intifada: People have certainly employed social media as a weapon in the conflict, but that was before social media was all-encompassing, and before algorithmic design brought stuff to you before you knew you wanted to see it. Which means there’s a generation of Twitterers, Instagrammers, and TikTokers fully accustomed to sharing their views and advocating for causes online, but who haven’t seen pushback from most of their peers or bosses before.See, for example, a recent tweet from the New Yorker Union declaring support for Palestine by expressing “solidarity for Palestinians from the river to the sea.” After critics argued that the phrase was anti-Semitic — whether that’s true is also up for debate — the union deleted it.Then again, things are changing. It used to be that mainstream American politics had room for just one response when it came to Israel and Palestine. Now some Democrats, at least, are willing to critique Israeli behavior instead of supporting the country’s actions without reservation.So are some celebrities, though there are limits to how freely they can express that. Earlier this month, Mark Ruffalo, who has a starring role in Disney’s Marvel universe, compared Israel to South African apartheid. Now he seems to have either walked back that post or something else:Which is a pretty good summary, maybe, of the mess we’re in right now: Americans have conflicting feelings about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but they aren’t quite sure about how to express that — and how publicly to do it. So of course journalists are in the same boat, but they’re also the ones who are often called on to pretend that they don’t have any opinion at all. That might have worked in the past. But it certainly doesn’t now. Which is why Emily Wilder’s story may stick with us for a while longer.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
European Jews face a surge of antisemitism amid Israel-Hamas war,2023-11-07,Vox,['Marin Cogan'],"Filed under:Antisemitic incidents are on the rise in France, Germany, and the UK.In Lyon, France, this weekend, a Jewish woman was stabbed in her home. The authorities said they found a swastika painted on her door. In Berlin last month, assailants threw Molotov cocktails at a synagogue and Jewish community center. Someone set fire to the Jewish section of Vienna, Austria’s, largest cemetery last week, and a violent mob stormed an airfield and hotel looking for Jewish passengers when a flight arrived from Israel in Dagestan, a Russian republic that borders Azerbaijan and Georgia.Reports of antisemitic incidents are soaring in countries across Europe, following Israel’s bombardment of Gaza in response to the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7, which killed roughly 1,400 Israelis. Health authorities in Gaza say the bombing has killed 10,000 Palestinians so far, including more than 4,000 children, sparking outrage so intense that Jewish communities in Europe say they’re facing a level of hatred many of them haven’t seen before.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]In the United Kingdom, these reports of antisemitic incidents more than quadrupled in the days immediately following the initial attacks, according to the Community Security Trust, an organization dedicated to protecting the British Jewish population. (The reports, it’s worth noting, often include a broad range of behavior, from physical assaults to tearing down posters of Israeli hostages.) In Germany, an organization that tracks antisemitism reported 70 incidents in the 11 days following the Hamas attacks, triple the number in the same period the year before. In France — home to Europe’s largest Jewish community, where Jews make up less than 1 percent of the population — interior minister Gérald Darmanin said there had been more than 1,000 incidents in the last month. “The number of antisemitic acts has exploded,” Darmanin told a French news network.Stars of David have been spray painted on Jewish homes in Paris and Berlin — an ominous echo of the violence, forced displacement, and genocide European Jews experienced in these same places less than 100 years ago. “I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,” a elderly woman whose apartment was graffitied told a French television network. The animosity Jewish communities are experiencing is so striking that the European Commission, part of the European Union’s executive branch, issued a statement on Sunday: “The spike of antisemitic incidents across Europe has reached extraordinary levels in the last few days, reminiscent of some of the darkest times in history,” it said. “European Jews today are again living in fear.”Those fears are acutely felt by Jewish leaders across the continent. “Jews in Europe today no longer feel safe on this continent,” Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chair of the European Jewish Association, told the EU Observer, a news outlet based in Brussels, Belgium. “The wave is terrible,” Bernard-Henri Lévy, the Jewish French public intellectual, wrote on X. “In my life, I’ve never seen this.” “I have never been so afraid,” the head of the German Union of Jewish Students told the Wall Street Journal last week.European Jews aren’t the only minority group being targeted due to the violence in the Middle East. An organization dedicated to tracking Islamophobia found that reports of Islamophobic acts in the UK increased five-fold in the days after the Hamas attacks, according to the Financial Times. European Muslims are worried for their safety. “Muslims are really afraid of being stigmatised and blamed, and lumped together with Hamas supporters,” Lamya Kaddor, a German lawmaker of Syrian descent, told the paper. In the United States, too, both Muslim and Jewish communities are being singled out by acts of hatred.As in the US, the current onslaught is not happening in a vacuum, but amid a climate of rising antisemitism. For the Jews of Europe, though, the context is unique. Less than a century ago, in 1939, Europe was home to the world’s largest population of Jewish people — 9.5 million, according to the demographer and historian Sergio DellaPergola. After 6 million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, the number of Jews in Europe fell to 3.5 million; in the decades since, the population has dwindled even further, with survivors and their descendants leaving the continent and moving to the United States, Israel, and other non-European countries in search of safety and freedom from discrimination.Today, the Jewish population in Europe is significantly smaller than the populations of both Israeli and American Jews (each country is home to about 7 million Jews.) European Jews, meanwhile, make up between 780,000 and 1 million of the more than 445 million people living in the European Union, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, an organization dedicated to studying Jewish populations across Europe. Because of this history, the leaders of many western European countries are vocal in their commitment to fighting antisemitism. Germany, along with roughly two dozen other European countries, have explicit laws outlawing Holocaust denial and hate speech against Jews. In statements condemning the antisemitism in Germany, both President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke of their country’s special obligation to fight hatred against Jews, stemming from their government’s role in perpetrating genocide against Jews in the 20th century. “It is unbearable that Jews are living in fear again today — in our country of all places,” Steinmeier said at a rally in Berlin last month. “Every single attack on Jews, on Jewish institutions, is a disgrace for Germany.”UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised that the government would “do everything in our power” to fight what police called a “massive increase” in antisemitic incidents. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was the country’s “first duty” to protect its Jewish citizens from violence. In several cities, police have stepped up patrols around synagogues and Jewish schools.Macron’s government in France went so far as to try banning pro-Palestinian protests, citing the likelihood that they would cause public unrest. The decision has been criticized by human rights advocates who argue that citizens of France and other European countries should have the right to protest Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, and see the effort to suppress the protests as part of a troubling record of ongoing discrimination against Muslims.The attempts to ban the protests haven’t worked. Across Europe, and much of the world, people have taken to the streets to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Though the protests have largely been peaceful, and objecting to the Israeli military’s bombardment of Gaza isn’t inherently antisemitic, there is a range of opinion, including among Jewish people, over which slogans and actions are legitimate protest and which engage with antisemitism. This includes the use of “from the river to the sea,” a phrase many Jewish people have long understood as a call for the elimination of Jews from the region, but which supporters of the Palestinian liberation argue is meant to connote freedom for the Palestinians living under occupation.Disagreements aside, there is real reason for concern about the rise of antisemitism in Europe because previous conflicts between Israel and Palestine have correlated with spikes in antisemitism there. As Vox’s Zack Beauchamp has written, citing data from Tel Aviv University, “during the 2008-’09 Gaza war, there was a massive spike in anti-Semitic violence, death threats, and vandalism worldwide — with a high percentage concentrated in European countries with sizable Jewish populations like France.”In 2014 and 2021, conflicts between Israel and Palestine led to vandalism and other antisemitic acts in Germany, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. It wasn’t just Europe: In 2021, Jewish diners at a Los Angeles sushi restaurant were attacked during the unrest in Palestine and Israel.In France, those incidents are closely connected to the public’s memory of recent terrorist attacks targeting Jewish people. In the French city of Toulouse, in 2012, a gunman killed a rabbi and three children at a Jewish school in an attack he said was meant in part to avenge the deaths of Palestinian children. In 2015, four people were killed at a kosher supermarket in Paris, an antisemitic attack coordinated by Islamic extremists, which also claimed the lives of 12 people at the office of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical French newspaper.Now, with Israel’s siege of Gaza and subsequent anger with the Israeli government’s actions growing, European Jews are grappling with a sense that strong words from their leaders might not be enough to protect them. Some Jewish schools have canceled classes, and schoolchildren in England have been told they don’t need to wear identifying pieces of their uniforms, like logos, outside of school. Some men are hiding their kippot, or head coverings, under hats, while Jewish families are covering their mezuzahs, the tiny parchment scrolls where they keep Torah scriptures on their doorframes. Others are trying not to speak Hebrew in public, for fear of making themselves a target.Most pointedly, they fear that the situation in their communities could quickly deteriorate. “For the first time in my life I don’t feel my kids are safe at school,” one Jewish resident of Paris who lived through the attacks in 2012 and 2015 told the Guardian. “What can I say to my kids?”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Religious conflict in Jerusalem may not have political solutions,2018-05-18,Vox,['Amy Erica Smith'],"Filed under:Research shows that fights over heavenly real estate may not be amenable to earthly solutions.
    This post is part of Mischiefs of Faction, an independent political science blog featuring reflections on the party system.
  As the US unveiled its new, controversial embassy in Jerusalem this week, 60 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces after they attempted to storm the Israel-Gaza border in protest. Though this recent swell of violence is the latest in a long history of clashes, religious symbolism and claims have been particularly prominent in the past few days. Understanding what happened this week requires recognizing that the conflict is not just a material struggle for land. Instead, territorial control has tremendous symbolic significance for the religious and national identities of Israelis and Palestinians. But US evangelicals also perceive the conflict in religious terms. That is, Jews, Muslims, and Christians disagree not just about earthly ownership of the 50-square-mile territory but also about divine intentions. Research shows that the theological roots of the conflict will make it particularly difficult to solve — yet religion can also point toward new solutions.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is about many things. Both sides have important material stakes and demands: defensible, contiguous borders, mutual security, and access to resources. Third-party interventions in this conflict generally aim to negotiate a solution to those material conflicts. Indeed, this focus — and the accompanying notion that land and resources are fundamentally negotiable and divisible — is at the heart of the search for a two-state solution. However, Israelis and Palestinians often do not see it this way. In a recent study, one of us found that a majority of sampled Israeli Jews, Palestinian citizens of Israel, and Palestinians residing in the West Bank all framed the conflict as primarily identity-based: either nationalist or religious in origin. While 51 percent of Israeli Jews saw the conflict as nationalist in nature, Palestinians were particularly likely to view the conflict in religious terms — nearly 64 percent of sampled Palestinians in the West Bank and 50 percent of Palestinians in Israel.Does it matter whether people are fighting over religion or land? In a word, yes — a great deal. Earthly territory is divisible. By contrast, many religious groups perceive that real estate in the afterlife and divine will on earth are not amenable to division, compromise, or bargaining. Indeed, the recent study in Israel and Palestine showed that those who perceived the conflict in religious terms were much less willing to compromise, even accounting for other important factors like ideology and religiosity. Scholars argue that theologies create several “scarce resources” to which different religious groups claim privileged access: understanding of the divine will, access to sacred territories, and entrance to the afterlife. Yet different groups’ claims are mutually incompatible. For instance, the Temple Mount in Jerusalem is revered by Jews as the site of the ancient Jewish temples and by Muslims as the location of Mohammed’s ascent to heaven, making this single site one of the most contested spaces in the world.But the problem is not just disagreement. What makes it especially hard to resolve religious conflicts is that the claims are mutually unverifiable. No territorial deed or real estate registry can satisfactorily resolve disagreements over divine intentions for a sacred space. Religious faith tends to imbue followers with moral conviction in their own claims, yet it does not provide a common tool or framework for resolving disagreements. As a result, when different groups’ claims over religious resources conflict, violence is especially likely. Two other features of religion exacerbate this explosive tendency: religion’s potency as a form of group identity that heightens perceived grievances, and its unique capacity to inspire self-sacrifice. Indeed, evidence shows that religion increases militancy among Israeli Jews. For instance, Israelis take “more hard‐line positions against a land‐for‐peace compromise” during times in the religious calendar that require intensive prayer. Likewise, Israelis who identify with religion over nation tend to more strongly endorse retaliation against Palestinian militants. But the causal arrow points in the other direction, too, from violence to religious claims. Violent militants strategically adopt religious rhetoric to mobilize followers and retain members, resulting in a cycle of violence steeped in religious language. As a result, framing the struggle over Jerusalem in terms of sacred values intensifies the conflict and cuts off avenues for resolving the conflict. If both sides perceive that losing Jerusalem dispossesses them not only of land but also of sacred resources, certain compromises become unacceptable. Moreover, if both parties use religion as a legitimation strategy in bargaining, they can become locked into rhetoric constructing Jerusalem as fundamentally indivisible. For example, despite the wide range of views in the Israeli population about the feasibility and contours of a two-state solution, 73 percent of Israeli Jews support moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, and only 5 percent oppose it. Moreover, though Israeli Jews (unlike Palestinians) are still more likely to frame the conflict as nationalist than religious, this may be changing as Israel’s ultra-Orthodox and religious settler enterprise continues to drastically expand and gain control of levers of government. Within 40 years, 29 percent of Israel’s population is projected to be ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) — a threefold increase from the current 9 percent.What makes this conflict yet more intractable is that US-based evangelical Christians have become a third religious stakeholder. As the role of two evangelical ministers in the opening ceremony of the US Embassy made clear, religion is also key to understanding support for Israel on the American right. Among American evangelicals, “belief in Biblical inerrancy engenders ‘messianic’ militarism.” Two aspects of evangelical theology promote support for Israel: a belief that God has established a covenant with the people of Israel, and visions of a coming “end times” starring Israel. For instance, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro drew controversy this week for claiming that moving the US Embassy “fulfilled a biblical prophecy ... that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state.” Thus, the events in Jerusalem, Gaza, and across the West Bank result not only from material disagreements and national interests but also, in part, from mutually incompatible claims over the divine will: Who has the God-given right to this land? At present, the goals of American evangelicals and the hawkish Israeli government largely align. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that evangelical Christians perceive themselves as taking part in a divinely foretold prophecy in which their Jewish Israeli allies are supporting actors who will either eventually convert to Christianity or suffer eternal damnation. This evangelical script may not easily accommodate prospective Israeli attempts at rapprochement, or partial cession of sacred spaces.Yet just as religion exacerbates conflict, it also has the potential to create new solutions. What R. Scott Appleby called the “ambivalence of the sacred” leads religion simultaneously to inspire suicide bombers and “militants for peace and justice.” Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. constitute just two of the most prominent leaders who have drawn creatively on religion’s human and ideological resources to build new movements and “political theologies” that leveled inequalities and created bridges between religious groups. In Israel, groups like the Interreligious Coordinating Council, among others, are working to do just that. The conditions facing would-be religious entrepreneurs for peace and justice in Israel-Palestine are daunting — yet they may hold the key to succeeding where more earthly approaches have failed.

Jewish voters are lukewarm on Bernie Sanders — for now,2020-02-19,Vox,['Sarah M. Seltzer'],"Filed under:As the race heats up, polling suggests Sanders is not the frontrunner among Jewish Democratic voters. There are several possible reasons why.After his early primary victories, Sen. Bernie Sanders is closer to being America’s first Jewish president than anyone has come in the country’s history. But 10 years ago, he was just an iconoclastic socialist senator from a small New England state where I, a Jewish girl from New York, happened to be attending graduate school. Several times, I watched Sen. Sanders walk down Montpelier, Vermont’s, Main Street, for a July Fourth parade and expressed my approval so intensely my classmates teased me. I was kvelling (a Yiddish word that means feeling a sense of pride). As a secular New York Jew, Bernie felt like family. And as an avowed democratic socialist, he was one of a mere handful of national political figures whose positions aligned with my core beliefs. My excitement arose mostly from the connection between these qualities: the idea of Judaism and social justice as intertwined.Yet fast-forward to 2020 and polling indicates that full-throated Jewish support for Sanders hasn’t yet materialized. In fact, one Pew survey conducted before the Iowa caucuses in mid-January found that Jewish support hadn’t consolidated around any one candidate, despite the historic presence of Sanders and another Jewish contender — Mike Bloomberg — in the race. According to Pew, only one in five Jewish voters preferred either Sanders (11 percent) or Bloomberg (8 percent). The other candidates for the Democratic nomination had similarly split support, with 31 percent preferring Biden, 20 percent for Warren, and 13 percent for Buttigieg; the remaining 11 percent were undecided, refused to answer, or gave another response. (We don’t know yet how Sanders’s strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire will affect these numbers.)If you’re surprised by this variety in Jewish voters’ preferences, you’re not paying attention. Yes, American Jews are a reliable Democratic voting bloc. Despite efforts by the Trump administration to use Israel policy (including moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem) to court Jewish votes, he remains wildly unpopular with Jewish voters. In the general election, our support will likely rally around whoever wins the Democratic mantle, whether or not it’s Sanders. But the clichéd-for-a-reason saying goes like this: “two Jews, three opinions.” And this early primary polling is a perfect example.Like many American Jews who see our heritage as an identity, a culture, and a way of thinking rather than solely a “faith,” Sanders identifies as both Jewish and secular. He has spoken more about his background this campaign season than in the 2016 election, connecting his family’s history of persecution with his values. For many, Sanders embodies a particular way of being Jewish. He draws a “universalistic vision of a better world from particular Jewish experiences of suffering and oppression,” according to Jewish Currents’ Joshua Leifer. “What is familiar is not necessarily beloved ... but to be an American Ashkenazi Jew and listen to the speech of Bernie Sanders, and watch the motion of his hands, is to know he is one of us,” writes Talia Lavin at the New Republic, adding that Sanders is part of a “long and flourishing tradition of secular Jews — and in particular secular Jewish leftists — who were Jewish in every particle of their being.” A vocal group of younger Jews has made this affinity into their calling card, nicknaming him Zeyde (Yiddish for grandpa) and forming new “Jews for Bernie” groups around the country. But American Jews, far from a monolith, carry intersecting identities: We include women, LGBTQ folks, and people of color, and some of us are Sephardi or Mizrahi in origin. Some Jews, myself included, feel that electing a woman president is more urgent than a Jewish one. Even for me, an original Bernie fangirl, Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s aggressive defense of reproductive justice — my defining political issue — is compelling enough to compete for my vote. Some Jews don’t necessarily feel the kinship with Bernie that I do; they are religiously observant, in contrast to his secularism, or they experience their Jewishness differently. And why should it be otherwise? If the statistic that 53 percent of white women voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton teaches us anything, it’s that there is no rule saying people will vote based on a particular “group identity,” or even that group identity is a fixed category to begin with. With younger voters eschewing fellow millennial Pete Buttigieg for Sanders and older voters doing the opposite, with women voters not yet flocking to the female candidates and black voters sticking with Joe Biden in early polls, this is the primary that ought to put the final lie to the myth of identity-first voting.A few specific bumps do lie in the road for Sanders and Jewish voters, and they’re worth discussing. Israel is one. It’s ironic: Sanders is the only major presidential candidate who has lived in Israel, working on a kibbutz in his youth, and today his position on the occupation is more humane toward “the needs of the Palestinian people” than any of his rivals. Because he foregrounds the human rights crisis in Gaza and the West Bank, Sanders is facing heightened attacks on this issue, including from the so-called pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC. Right-wing factions have gone so far as to insinuate that he’s anti-Semitic. While this is ridiculous on its face (and, in fact, Sanders’s two-state position on Israel and Palestine lines up with the majority of American Jews), the fear-mongering may be enough to deter a number of Jewish voters from jumping on the Sanders bandwagon.Another stumbling block to Jews’ full-throated embrace is the fear of an anti-Semitic backlash. Barack Obama’s presidency and Clinton’s nomination have shown that when a member of an underrepresented group achieves new heights politically, it invites vitriol and backlash. Given that anti-Semitism is already on the rise, many older Jews in particular may feel that nominating Sanders will attract attention they don’t need. “Whenever rapid social change threatens the stability of the existing social order, the right-wing is tempted to fall back on the explanation of left-wing politics as a Jewish plot,” Joel Swanson writes at the Forward. “The inconvenient fact that the most successful Jewish presidential candidate in history is also the most successful socialist can only feed this conspiracy theory.” It’s also undeniable that some American Jews — like some people of all groups and backgrounds — may be wary of Sanders’s urgent social messaging. This group of voters may hate Trump, but they are unmoved by Sanders’s call for radical realignment or “revolution,” believing it to be impractical, too extreme, or an impediment to defeating Trump. Sanders will have to win over these cautious voters of all backgrounds in order to make it to the White House. A poll of American Jews taken in September 2019 by the progressive Jewish group Bend the Arc and released this week found that “75% view President Trump unfavorably, and 66% view him very unfavorably ... in an open-ended question about what matters most about the 2020 elections, the most common response was defeating Donald Trump.”Many of the concerns mentioned above break down along age lines, with younger voters tending to embrace Zeyde’s radical politics more warmly than their parents. This is a pattern that appears to hold across demographics. But policy and ideology aside, I’d imagine most Jewish voters are simply preoccupied with the same “electability” obsession that many Democrats keep expressing. They want someone who can beat Trump and are hedging their bets, or backing whoever seems like a moderate frontrunner, until the best contender becomes apparent — hence the support of Biden before Iowa. In the coming weeks, we should question any narratives that try to pin Sanders’s lower polling numbers among Jews on his views on Israel, anti-Semitism, or any single determining factor. Like everyone else, American Jews are following the results, listening to the policy debates, watching the news, and waiting for their fellow Democrats to make their choice. And if that choice is Sanders, there may be worries, yes, but there will also be a lot of kvelling.Sarah M.

The Ohio derailment is spurring Congress to actually do something about train safety,2023-03-02,Vox,['Nicole Narea'],"Filed under:A group of senators have quickly come together with a bill that could change the way the rail industry operates. In the wake of the train derailment and toxic spill in East Palestine, Ohio, last month, a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill to provide more oversight over railroad carriers and improve industry safety regulations with the aim of preventing future accidents.On February 3, a freight train carrying five tank cars of the toxic chemical vinyl chloride derailed and ignited, prompting first responders to order an evacuation of the surrounding area. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board found that a wheel bearing severely overheated immediately before the accident, and while the train braked after detectors picked up the hotter than normal temperatures, it did so too late and through no apparent fault of the workers onboard. It’s hard to know yet where exactly it went wrong in the chain of command, from the private rail companies that preside over their own maintenance and inspections to the policymakers who regulate them. But whoever is to blame, residents of East Palestine and surrounding communities in Pennsylvania where the toxic fumes have now spread are still complaining of ailments ranging from rashes to bronchitis and have been instructed to monitor their health long-term.Though both parties have been pointing fingers at each other over the accident, the bill is a compromise among Republican Sens. J.D. Vance (Ohio), Marco Rubio (Florida), and Josh Hawley (Missouri), and Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), and Bob Casey and John Fetterman (both of Pennsylvania). The bill has earned praise from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, but it’s not clear whether it will get the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate or pass the GOP-controlled House. In a video posted to Twitter, Sen. Brown blamed railroad executives including those at Norfolk Southern, the operator of the train that derailed in East Palestine, for failing to appropriately invest in train safety and for laying off workers while spending billions on stock buybacks.“We know that means more train derailments, less safe trains. It means that in too many cases, hazardous materials end up in the water or in the air the way they have in East Palestine. This bill will begin to fix this and especially hold Norfolk Southern accountable,” he said.The bill, known as the Railway Safety Act of 2023, adopts many of the reforms that the Biden administration has called for. It would require rail carriers to notify emergency authorities when transporting hazardous materials; develop a plan in the event that gas such as vinyl chloride is discharged; and mitigate blocked railroad crossings due to train delays. It would introduce regulations requiring “well-trained, two person crews aboard every train” and around train length and weight, route selection, speed restrictions, track standards, maintenance, issue detection and more. In the East Palestine accident, detectors didn’t trip until moments before the derailment. Rail companies that fail to comply would face higher maximum fines under the bill. The bill also boosts funding for HAZMAT training, for research and development into tank car safety features, and for the Federal Railroad Administration generally. It’s hard to say whether those measures would have stopped the East Palestine accident from happening. But they might have allowed workers to catch malfunctions early, and keep them from happening in the first place with preventive maintenance on the train and track. While the bill makes strides in improving safety regulations, it doesn’t include everything on Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s wishlist. For one, he has asked rail carriers to “join a close call reporting system that protects whistleblowers who spot issues that could lead to accidents,” in which only one freight rail company currently participates voluntarily. (Rail carriers have previously cited concerns about confidentiality of the data and their own internal safety reporting systems as reasons for not participating.)The bill also doesn’t include any protections for railroad workers, who threatened to go on strike in December amid complaints of grueling conditions with little work-life balance. They have reported being on call 24/7 every day of the year, unable to call in sick or even go to the doctor. That month, President Joe Biden reluctantly signed legislation to avert a strike, which forced unions to accept a contract that did not include paid sick days — a major sticking point in the negotiations. Offering the 15 paid sick days demanded by unions would have forced carriers, including Norfolk Southern, to hire more workers, cutting into their profits. But Rubio and Vance have questioned whether spreading these workers too thin may have contributed to the safety failures that led to the East Palestine accident. Both Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for the policy gaps that allowed the East Palestine accident to occur. Though Buttigieg has faced attacks from the right amid pandemic supply chain disruptions and a federal aviation safety system failure in January, the criticism has reached a whole new level since the East Palestine accident. Even while co-sponsoring bipartisan reforms, Vance has criticized Buttigieg for failing to appear at the scene of the accident for 20 days. House Republicans have even introduced a resolution calling on Buttigieg to resign. “Secretary Buttigieg has seemed more interested in pursuing press coverage for woke initiatives and climate nonsense than in attending to the basic elements of his day job,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor.For his part, Buttigieg has contended that the Trump administration bears responsibility for rolling back regulations that required regular safety audits and fast-braking trains to carry flammable materials.“I heard [former President Donald Trump] say he had nothing to do with it, even though it was in his administration. So, if he had nothing to do with it and they did it in his administration against his will, maybe he can come out and say that he supports us moving in a different direction,” Buttigieg said while visiting East Palestine.As my colleague Ben Jacobs writes, Trump’s decision to visit East Palestine last month shows that Republicans have seized on the accident not just as a vehicle to attack the Biden administration, but also as an “opportunity for the GOP’s populist wing to further break from party orthodoxy and target corporate America.”The White House has also criticized Republicans for pressuring the Federal Railroad Administration to rely more heavily on automated track inspection over manual inspections and for proposing to slash funding for chemical spill cleanup. In light of the vitriol surrounding the accident, it’s a wonder that the bipartisan group could reach any kind of agreement on reforms. But it seems to have been spearheaded by an unlikely partnership between the two Ohio senators: Brown, a progressive, and Vance, a pro-Trump freshman. “[Vance has] been nothing but cooperative on this,” Brown told Politico.

How does Iran fit into the war between Israel and Hamas?,2023-10-14,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:Iran likely won’t launch direct attacks against Israel, but the possibility of a regional conflagration is real.       Speculation around Iran’s involvement in Hamas’s gruesome attack on Israel has been rampant over the past week — along with questions about whether the Islamic Republic or any of its regional proxies will get involved in the war between Israel and Hamas. Iran has denied involvement in planning the attack, but the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised the slaughter in a televised address Tuesday. “We kiss the hands of those who planned the attack on the Zionist regime,” Khamenei said. “The Zionist regime’s own actions are to blame for this disaster.” Hamas, for its part, has claimed sole responsibility for the attack on October 7, in which militants killed an estimated 1,200 Israelis, mainly civilians, injured upward of 3,000, and took as many as 150 hostages.Though Iran and Israel have been in conflict since the 1979 Iranian revolution, there has never been outright war between the two. However, Iran does support proxies in the region, including Hezbollah, the Shia militant group in southern Lebanon, which could opt to join the conflict, though thus far it’s not clear that the group has made any concrete moves in that direction. (Rockets were fired from southern Lebanon this week toward what is now northern Israel, though it’s not clear at this point whether they were launched by Hezbollah or another group.)Iran does provide material support to Hamas as well as training and money, experts told Vox, as does Hezbollah. Proxy groups — armed groups affiliated with a state actor — like the Fatemiyoun Brigade in Syria and the Badr Organization in Iraq, as well as the Houthis in Yemen, work more in concert with the Iranian regime, but it would be incorrect to automatically put the blame for Saturday’s attack right at the regime’s doorstep. “Hamas has a rather complex relationship [with Iran],” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, told Vox. “It’s a Sunni group, not a Shia group like most of the groups Iran supports, but it also has a history of rupture with Iran,” most notably over Iran’s support for the Assad regime at the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. Though groups like the Houthis in Yemen sometimes directly contradict the policies and wishes of their benefactor, such a significant political and ideological rift as that between Hamas and Iran “has almost never happened with any other non-state actor,” Vaez said.In addition to supplying Israel with ammunition and other materiel, the US has deployed a carrier strike group in the Eastern Mediterranean as a deterrent, US officials have said, to discourage Iran from getting involved via one of its proxy groups. Though it’s not likely that Iran would launch its own specific, direct attacks against Israel, the possibility of a regional conflagration is real. But gauging its likelihood, especially given that Iran has a lot to lose if it does get involved, is another question entirely. Israel and Iran once had close economic and strategic ties; Iran imported Israeli arms and Israel bought Iranian oil prior to the Iranian revolution in 1979. Both countries also had close ties with the US and considered fighting the Soviet Union and the spread of communism part of their foreign policy, according to the US Institute for Peace. But the 1979 revolution brought in a hard-line Shia government that considered Israel usurpers on Muslim land — and considered the US an enabler. “In this world view, Israel was seen as a Western colonial outpost and Zionism as a version of imperialism,” Shireen Hunter, an independent scholar and honorary fellow at Georgetown University’s Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, wrote in a piece for the Stimson Center in March. “At the time, many Arab governments also rejected Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state and radicals opposed to Egypt’s peace treaty with Israel formed a so-called Rejectionist Front.” Meanwhile, groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories also formed, partly against Israel but also in relation to constituencies on the ground. Hezbollah, for example, started in response to a number of pressures within Lebanon, not the least of which was Israel’s invasions in 1978 and 1982 to try to eliminate Palestinian militant groups in the region. This was also in the context of a brutal, 15-year sectarian civil war in Lebanon.In addition to carrying out terror attacks against US and Israeli targets in Lebanon, the group also provided some basic necessities and support for people living in poor Shia areas south of Beirut; that increased under the leadership of Hassan Nasrallah, whose investment in social services for this constituency increased Hezbollah’s popularity. In addition to its militant and terrorist activities, Hezbollah has representation in Lebanon’s parliament, though their political support declined in recent elections.Iran has provided funds and training to Hezbollah since the group’s early days, and the connection between the two is well documented, as the Islamic Republic has made attempts to increase its influence throughout the Middle East.The connection between Iran and Hamas is less cut-and-dried; though both the Islamic Republic and Hezbollah provide funding, training, and weapons to Hamas, Iran doesn’t direct its actions, nor does Hamas even necessarily coordinate with Iran regarding its plans. “Iran’s relationship with other groups really fits onto a spectrum,” Vaez said. “At one side of the spectrum you have Hezbollah, because Iran’s relationship with Hezbollah is really like two NATO allies.” Hezbollah has only Iran as a state backer, while Hamas and militant groups in Iraq and Syria have relationships with other nations. Indeed, Hamas has a looser relationship with Iran, though many experts agree that the group has benefited from Iranian funding, training, and other support. But there’s no clear reason to believe that Hamas would have coordinated with Iran on this particular attack, especially given the high level of penetration the Israeli security service has in the Iranian regime. Coordinating directly with Iran could have put Hamas’s plans for its October 7 attack at serious risk, Vaez said.Probably not. There is a lot to lose  — including access to $6 billion in assets, which the US and Qatar have already restricted pending investigation into Iran’s role in Hamas’s capabilities and attack against Israel, the New York Times reported Thursday.“There’s the Iran question of, does Iran get directly involved?” Raphael Cohen, director of the strategy and doctrine program of RAND Corporation’s Project Air Force, said during a panel discussion on Tuesday. “On the spectrum of ‘likely’ to ‘less likely,’ it’s probably one of the less likely scenarios. But should Israel feel the need to directly strike Iran or vice versa, that has a broader implication for regional war that could draw in not only Israel but a lot of the Arab states, the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia as well.”Vaez said that in the last several years it has been Israel on the offensive in Iran, rather than the other way around. “Israel and Iran have been engaged in a multidimensional cold war against one another for a long time,” Vaez said. “In the past few years, if you look at the covert operations Israel has conducted against Iran — and overt operations that it has conducted against Iranian personnel and assets in Syria — it really hasn’t [been] that much of a tit-for-tat,” with Israel waging cyber attacks against Iranian infrastructure, like the massive Stuxnet attack against Iran’s Natanz nuclear material enrichment facility and targeted assassinations of military commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran had also been on a significant deescalatory track with the US and other countries, most recently agreeing to a prisoner swap in September that freed several US citizens being held in Iran in exchange for the freedom of five Iranians and access to $6 billion in assets for humanitarian use. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have also made headway on easing tensions with Iran and charting a path forward to manage their various conflicts; putting that on the line to directly attack Israel seems unlikely.Hezbollah could certainly get directly involved; Hezbollah and Israel fought a war in southern Lebanon in 2006 which ended in an Israeli withdrawal and a deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces to southern Lebanon. “Hezbollah will make its decisions, and has made its decisions in the past, regardless of whether or not there is an American aircraft carrier there,” Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs in the Obama administration, told Vox. “So you have the US there to provide support and backup — and hopefully, enough muscle to get those who have influence over Hezbollah, to say, ‘back off.’”Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, did meet with senior Hezbollah leadership and Lebanese officials in Beirut this week, Reuters reports. “The continuation of war crimes against Palestine and Gaza will receive a response from the rest of the axis,” Amir-Abdollahian said Thursday, likely referring to Iran, Hezbollah, militant groups in Iraq and Syria, and Palestinian armed groups. “And naturally, the Zionist entity and its supporters will be responsible for the consequences of that.”But what exactly that means in the context of both the war and the deescalation efforts among Iran and its adversaries is not clear. What’s likeliest, Vaez said, is that groups Iran supports ideologically but with which it has loose ties, such as Palestinian armed groups or groups in Syria and Iraq, could take advantage of the conflict to either strike Israel or US positions in Syria and Iraq. There have been no attacks on US forces in either Syria or Iraq since March as part of the US and Iran’s deescalatory agreements, but if those agreements break down — because, for example, the US decides to permanently freeze the $6 billion being held in Qatar — that could be reason enough for Iran to encourage smaller allied groups to attack US positions.

Republicans and Democrats have never been more divided over Israel,2018-01-23,Vox,['Ricky Zipp'],"Filed under:Also, both parties have flipped by 45 percent in their opinions of Donald Trump versus Barack Obama.A new Pew Research Center survey shows that the divide between Democrats and Republicans regarding their support for Israel over the Palestinians is at its largest in the past four decades.The report shows that while 79 percent of Republicans sympathize more with Israel, only 27 percent of Democrats do. This is the largest divide between the two parties’ views on the issue since the poll was first conducted in 1978. That year, the divide between the two parties was a mere 5 points; since that time, the gap has widened steadily. The survey also shows that Republican sympathy toward Israel has grown by 29 points since 2001, while support for Israel by Democrats has declined by about 11 points over the same time.The division between the two political parties exists with religious affiliation as well.The religious demographic with the highest support for Israel is white evangelical Protestants: 78 percent said they sympathize with Israel, while only 5 percent said they sympathize with Palestinians. Twenty-six percent of those who said they were unaffiliated with a religious group said they sympathize with Israel.When asked whether President Donald Trump is “striking the right balance” with Israel, support was similarly divided. Seventy-three percent of Republicans and 21 percent of Democrats said that Trump was striking the right balance.Both parties have flipped by 45 percent in their opinions of Trump versus Barack Obama. In April 2010, 66 percent of Democrats believed that Obama was striking the right balance with Israel, and only 28 percent of Republicans felt the same way.The poll was conducted a little more than a month after Trump announced that he would move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.The poll comes out on the same day that Vice President Mike Pence — who is an evangelical Christian — is in Israel at the end of a four-day trip to the Middle East. According to the Washington Post, Pence received a warm welcome from Israeli officials during his two-day stay, during which he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and visited Jerusalem's Western Wall. During his speech to the Israeli parliament, called the Knesset, Pence announced that the move of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem could happen as early as 2019. This move was previously expected to take several years.However, not everyone responded positively to Pence's time in Israel. Arab politicians interrupted Pence's speech, holding up signs that said ""Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine,"" and were forced to leave.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
More than 500 Biden campaign alumni want a Gaza ceasefire,2023-11-09,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:What a letter from Biden’s field staff and organizers says about how Democrats see the Israel-Hamas war.For decades, American public opinion and policy on Israel has been near-monolithic. But as Israel’s bombardment and ground incursion of Gaza continues, arguments over Israel policy from inside the Democratic Party and throughout the State Department are spilling out into the open. That, in and of itself, shows that some Americans within the establishment are processing the current war differently — and may feel more empowered than before to shape the contours of US policy.President Joe Biden and congressional leaders have defended Israel’s military campaign to eliminate Hamas after the militant group’s October 7 attacks that killed 1,400 people and kidnapped over 200. As the death toll and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza grows, the president and his team have incrementally adjusted their public messaging, moving from a maximalist embrace of Israel after the attacks to discussing the need for a pause to allow humanitarian aid in, and hostages out. But the Biden administration, unlike the United Nations, World Health Organization, and humanitarian groups, has not advocated for an immediate ceasefire. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]That has led to internal dissent and activism within the diplomatic corps and the Democratic Party apparatus, pushing for Biden to urgently adjust his approach. On Thursday, over 500 alumni of Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign banded together to urge a ceasefire. The signatories include staffers from Biden’s 2020 campaign headquarters, the Democratic National Committee, and state staff and leadership; 21 states are represented, including key battlegrounds like Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. “As President of the United States, you have significant influence in this perilous moment,” the group, named Biden Alumni for Peace and Justice, writes in an open letter shared first exclusively with Vox. “[Y]ou must call for a ceasefire, hostage exchange, and de-escalation, and take concrete steps to address the conditions of occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing at the root of the horrific violence we are witnessing now.”“This is a rupture that’s happening,” Matan Arad-Neeman, an Israeli American activist who worked as a field organizer in Arizona and signed the letter, told me. The letter notes that 66 percent of voters think the US should call for a ceasefire, according to a recent Data for Progress survey. While polls mostly find that a plurality or majority of Americans think the US’s support for Israel is just about right, that hides a stark generational divide. Less than a quarter of young American likely voters approve of Biden’s Israel policies so far, according to a Quinnipiac survey conducted October 26-30. Given his reliance on young voters in 2020, that — and those voters’ general cooling on Biden — could pose a problem for a 2024 rematch with Donald Trump. Pressure is also being put on progressive senators. More than 400 former campaign staffers to Sen. Bernie Sanders and more than 400 from Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s orbit have each sent open letters calling for a ceasefire now. Sanders has rejected such calls, and Warren has shifted in recent days to calling for a humanitarian pause. Within government, there are also cracks emerging. Career diplomats and political appointees at the State Department are using the dissent channel, a special mechanism to submit critical memos of policy directly to top officials, to voice their calls for a ceasefire. (Diplomats have used the dissent channel in the leadup to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and to warn against Trump’s refugee ban). More than 630 employees from the international development agency USAID urged the Biden administration to advocate for “an immediate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities.” And a letter signed anonymously by more than 400 congressional staffers made a similar call. It’s becoming a truism that this Israel-Hamas war is different: the scale of Hamas’s destruction was unprecedented and has fundamentally altered Israel’s security thinking. Israel’s military campaign in the last month has caused more deaths than 15 years of conflict combined. But the response in the US differs from previous phases of the long-running conflict as well: there is a growing sense, at least among young people, that the US mainstream consensus on Israel policy has failed and has enabled the hellish conditions that could lead to more deaths in the region, and potentially a broader war in the Middle East.“As the President of the United States, you have power to change the course of history, and the responsibility to save lives right now,” the Biden Alumni for Peace and Justice write. “We are counting on you to take that power and responsibility seriously and to meet this moment with the urgency it demands. If you fail to act swiftly, your legacy will be complicity in the face of genocide.”This isn’t the first time that Biden Alumni for Peace and Justice has mobilized. Amid the Israel-Hamas war of May 2021, a group of more than 500 former staffers called on Biden “to hold Israel accountable for its actions and lay the groundwork for justice and lasting peace.” They urged Biden to demand that the Israeli government lift the blockade on Gaza, end home demolitions in East Jerusalem, and halt settlement expansion in the West Bank.Arad-Neeman organized the May 2021 letter (after which, he says, the White House reached out to him, but never set up a meeting). He hopes Biden will read the one currently being circulated. “I’m feeling a deep frustration that not only is he not meeting the moment, but he’s also actively enabling Israel’s deadly assault on Gaza,” he told me. “Hopefully, he’ll take this moment to actually reassess his policy and push towards equality, justice and a thriving future for all Israelis and Palestinians.”The White House maintains that a ceasefire would benefit Hamas. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller says Blinken welcomes dissent cables and “finds it useful to get conflicting voices that may differ from his opinion.” Today’s letter from the Biden Alumni for Peace and Justice urges the president to not only call for a ceasefire but also “use financial and diplomatic leverage to bring about” one, push Hamas to release hostages, put conditions on US military aid to Israel, and investigate whether Israeli operations in Gaza violate US law. The letter goes on to urge Biden to “take concrete steps to end the conditions of apartheid, occupation, and ethnic cleansing that are the root causes of this devastation.”That language — and those calls — echo what diplomats have written in various dissent memos to Secretary of State Antony Blinken since the war began. (At least one more is currently circulating, that Vox has seen.) Those internal protests have led administration leaders to hold listening sessions at the White House and at the State Department. And Biden’s team appears to be continually tweaking its rhetoric in part to address these internal criticisms, though the policy writ large remains constant.A senior official overseeing arms sales at the State Department, Josh Paul, resigned in protest last month. He told Democracy Now that “there has been an overwhelming response that I have heard from folks or from colleagues inside not only in the State Department, but across the U.S. government, actually, on the Hill, in the Defense Department, in the uniformed military services, including in combatant commands around the world.” Right now, these channels of dissent are mostly within the working level of these organizations. Speaking out publicly can be risky and detrimental to one’s career in politics. And among the upper echelons of the administration, traditional views about the preeminence of the American-Israeli partnership tend to dominate.But internal feedback can change policy, as it has since the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. Young progressives have wielded sway in lawmakers’ offices, nonprofits, and even Biden’s own campaign. “Campaign staffers see that a lot of our struggles are connected,” Heba Mohammad, a Palestinian American who worked as Biden’s digital organizing director in Wisconsin for 2020, told me. “We’re working based on our values, and we’re going to hold our candidates to account for representing those values that they themselves have espoused.”The signatories to today’s letter worked in critical states that helped Biden carry the presidency, and implicitly suggest they won’t be doing that if there isn’t a shift in Biden’s policy on Israel. “I hope that he recognizes that those of us who put so much time into his campaign are feeling ashamed of his administration’s position right now,” Arad-Neeman, who also works as communications director for IfNotNow, told me.Though there are warning signs for Biden in some polls (a recent New York Times-Siena survey found him trailing in five of six battleground states), it is hard to make reliable predictions about voters a year out from the presidential election. What is clear is that members of the organizing community and campaign machinery, who will have to get to work much sooner (like, now), could step back absent a change in Biden’s policy toward Israel. “There is outrage among people who work in Democratic politics about this,” Juliana Amin, who held senior roles in Iowa for Warren’s presidential primary campaign and the Iowa Democratic Party’s general election campaign, told me. “And we are the people who do the work that campaigns need, that wins elections, that uplift people and their platforms, and I know a lot of people who aren’t willing to do that work anymore if Democrats continue to enable genocide.”It’s worth keeping in mind that a Trump presidency would also enable Israel, but there are indications that the situation would likely be worse. As ever, his comments with respect to this war are all over the place. He promised Hamas’s October 7 victims would be avenged “even beyond what you’re thinking about,” criticized Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on seemingly false grounds, and said he would have helped Israel make peace with Iran had he been reelected in 2020. Most alarmingly, he said he would restore and expand his Muslim migration ban to restrict Palestinian refugees from Gaza from entering the US.But as President Biden begins to fundraise for his reelection campaign, the voices of those who organized for him before are growing louder.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The Alice Walker anti-Semitism controversy, explained",2018-12-20,Vox,['Constance Grady'],"Filed under:The beloved activist and author of The Color Purple is under fire for promoting an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory in an interview with the New York Times. Alice Walker, the beloved activist and author of The Color Purple, is under fire for promoting an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Walker has flirted with anti-Semitism for years, but the public at large seemed to ignore it — until last weekend, when she took some time in her New York Times Book Review “By the Book” interview to admiringly shout out David Icke. Icke is best known for arguing that the world is run by a secret cabal of alien lizard people, many of whom are Jewish. While Walker has previously recommended Icke’s work on her blog, this is the first time her apparent affinity for him has gone quite so public. (Vox has reached out to Walker and Walker’s publisher, Atria, for comment.)“In Icke’s books there is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think about,” Walker said in the column, specifically noting And the Truth Shall Set You Free, in which Icke variously argues both that Jews funded the Holocaust and that maybe the Holocaust did not happen. Icke’s books, Walker says, are “a curious person’s dream come true.”Walker’s recommendation, and the New York Times’s decision to publish it without comment, has attracted widespread outrage. “The only thing that is accomplished by uncritically disseminating Walker’s bigoted book bon mots is ensuring that the racism is disseminated to more people,” wrote Yair Rosenberg in a widely circulated article in Tablet. He adds, “Anti-Semitism is not incidental to Icke’s book, it is essential. It is impossible to miss it.”Both Walker and Icke have contested the idea that Icke is anti-Semitic.In a post on her website published in response to the outrage over her By the Book interview, Walker writes of Icke, “I do not believe he is anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish. I do believe he is brave enough to ask the questions others fear to ask, and to speak his own understanding of the truth wherever it might lead. Many attempts have been made to censor and silence him. As a woman, and a person of color, as a writer who has been criticized and banned myself, I support his right to share his own thoughts.”In a statement to Vox, Icke wrote, “To claim that the book is ‘anti-Semitic’ — or that I am — is utterly ridiculous.” To understand exactly how Walker, Icke, and the New York Times all came together — and why it’s so upsetting to so many people that they did — you have to understand Icke’s history as peddler of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, Walker’s largely ignored history of anti-Semitic writing, and the unexpected lightning rod for controversy that is the New York Times’s By the Book interview. Here’s the background.David Icke first rose to fame in the UK as a soccer player, but his career ended when he developed rheumatoid arthritis at age 21. He stayed in the public spotlight working as a sports commentator, and he began to explore politics as a spokesperson for the ecology-focused UK Green Party in the 1980s. It was while Icke was searching for a treatment for his arthritis that he began to explore alternative medicine. From there, he became interested in New Age spiritualism, then began hanging out with psychics, and ultimately came to the conclusion that he himself was “the son of a Godhead.” In 1991, Icke resigned from the Green Party (which would later ban him, calling him a fascist), and then set out on a press tour during which he discussed his claim that he was the son of a Godhead. In Britain, Icke became a much-mocked spectacle: In his most infamous appearance, he welcomed gales of laughter from the audience for one of his interviews, and the interviewer had to explain to him, “They’re laughing at you. They’re not laughing with you.”Icke commenced traveling the world to share his message, delivering lectures and publishing books and videos. The details of that message have evolved over time, but for the past few decades, the broad strokes have remained the same. They are as follows: Icke’s theories are objectionable for many reasons, beginning with the fact that they are, objectively speaking, ridiculous. But particularly worrisome is the anti-Semitism of his worldview: The idea that the world is run by a secret cabal of Jews (it’s not) is a recurring theme, and the idea that these imaginary Jews drink blood and sacrifice Christian babies (they don’t) goes back centuries and has been used to justify horrific persecution of Jewish people since before the Crusades.  Icke maintains that he is not an anti-Semite, and that he is criticizing not real Jews, but 12-foot-tall alien lizard people, many of whom just happen to be posing as Jews. “I‘m not talking about one earth race, Jewish or non-Jewish,” he told the Guardian in 2001. “I’m talking about a genetic network that operates through all races, this bloodline being a fusion of human and reptilian genes.”“My philosophy and view of life is that we are all points of attention within the same state of Infinite Awareness and the labels we are given and give ourselves are merely temporary experiences and not who we are,” he said in a statement to Vox. “Thus to me all racism is ridiculous and completely missing the point of who we are and where we are.”If you believe in lizard people, this distinction might conceivably matter, but if you don’t, the result is that Icke is still projecting vile conspiracy theories onto a whole bunch of Jewish people, whether he thinks they are Jewish or not, which makes his hair-splitting look academic at best. And Icke’s conspiracy theories return again and again to anti-Semitic tropes. Yair Rosenberg has outlined a number of them at Tablet magazine, but here is a quick overview of some of Icke’s ideas: that a Jewish organization was behind the slave trade; that far-right groups are actually Jewish fronts; that a Jewish group funded the Holocaust (“The Warburgs, part of the Rothschild empire, helped finance Adolf Hitler,” he writes in The Truth Shall Set You Free); that schools should allow students to study Holocaust deniers.He also goes after the Anti-Defamation League, which he claims is a hate group but is in fact a Jewish advocacy group. “I am told by an extremely reliable source very close to the intelligence organisations that the ‘far Right’ group, Combat 18, is a front for the sinister Anti-Defamation League, the United States and of the ‘Israeli’/Rothschild secret service, Mossad,” Icke writes in And the Truth Shall Set You Free. “The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has been operating in Britain and Europe since at least 1991 and its role is to brand as anti-Semitic anyone who is getting close to the truth of what is going on. What better way to discredit an investigator than to have a ‘far Right’ group like Combat 18 to praise them?”For the record, Combat 18 is a neo-Nazi hate group, and there is no evidence that it is a front for the ADL. And again, the ADL is not a hate group; it’s an advocacy group devoted to fighting anti-Semitism. Icke also focused on the ADL in his statement to Vox. “The public are now getting sick and tired of this constant mantra about everything from hate groups like the ADL whose modus operandi is simply to urge people to hate their ever-gathering number of targets,” he wrote. “Organisations like the ADL are obsessed with the labels and completely and utterly self-identify with them. So who’s obsessed with ‘race’ — me or them? Alice Walker has the high-intelligence to see this. The ADL and their like do not. I feel sorry for them and I hope that one day they will wake up from their trance.”He is similarly fervent on his belief that Holocaust denialism should be taught in schools. “Why do we play a part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the Second World War?” he writes in And the Truth Shall Set You Free. “How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, free copies of the Spielberg film, Schindler’s List, are given to schools to indoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events? And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history?”Despite, or perhaps because of, the fringe nature of Icke’s beliefs, over the course of his long career, he has steadily accumulated followers. In 2012, the Independent watched Icke deliver a lecture to a rapturous crowd of 6,000 people and reported that Icke had sold more than 140,000 copies of his books in the UK. He has embarked on multiple world tours and reliably sold out his venues.And the industry tracker Nielsen BookScan told Vox that between 2004 and December 2018, Icke has sold a combined 233,000 copies of his books in the US. That’s not a blockbuster number — it averages out to around 20,000 copies per book, which is not on the level of, say Bill O’Reilly. However, it does indicate that Icke has a reliable audience for his work, and that his audience has continued to grow.  Back when the Independent covered Icke’s 2011 tour, many journalists were able to observe Icke’s popularity with a bemused smile: Look how funny, people actually believe this nut. But over the past few years, as widely disseminated conspiracy theories have helped usher in the rise of far-right populist nationalism, figures like Icke have come to seem actively dangerous. If Icke can convince people that the world is run by a cabal of mostly Jewish lizard people who are molesting and murdering kids — well, who knows what his followers will do with that belief?Which makes it all the more unnerving when a figure as beloved as Alice Walker endorses him, and has now done so via a platform as big as the New York Times.For her entire public life, Alice Walker has stood for social justice and for great writing. After she graduated college in 1965, she worked first for the New York Department of Welfare and then for the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund. At Ms. Magazine in the 1970s, Walker helped rediscover and revive the legacy of Zora Neale Hurston. She coined the term “womanist.” She published The Color Purple in 1982, then won the Pulitzer Prize for it, then saw it adapted into a Steven Spielberg-directed movie that gave Oprah Winfrey her first film role and earned 11 Oscar nominations.Walker’s legacy seemed to be clear: She was both an artist and an activist who would stand by marginalized people in all of her work.All of which perhaps made many people willing to avert their attention and avoid talking about the apparent anti-Semitism in Walker’s work and public statements as she began to flirt ever more publicly with the theories of David Icke over the past decade.  That’s not to say that no major media figure has ever discussed it before now. Jewish media has been keeping track of the growing trend in her work for years, and Roxane Gay has noted that she makes a point of mentioning it whenever she praises Walker’s other work in public. It’s been out there for years, in Walker’s writing and public comments, for anyone paying close attention to Walker to see. But major outlets like the New York Times have pointedly avoided mentioning it, which means that for the general public, anti-Semitism wasn’t part of the story of Alice Walker. Until now.Walker has long been a vocal critic of Israel and its treatment of Palestine. In 2012, she refused to allow the publication of an Israeli edition of The Color Purple, saying that she believes the country “is guilty of apartheid and persecution of the Palestinian people.” Criticizing Israel of course does not mean that someone is anti-Semitic, but Walker’s critique of Israel has at times been much more extreme: In her 2013 book The Cushion on the Road, she repeatedly compares Israel to Nazi Germany. And when she began to show an interest in David Icke, things got weird.Walker first began to write about Icke in 2013. In a post on her blog, she enthusiastically recommended his book Human Race Get Off Your Knees, writing, “A lot of it is how shall we say: shocking, beyond belief (but not really, if you don’t get too scared), stunning, profound. The deconstruction of language is breathtaking, the interrogation of symbols startling. Magical, in a way. I kept going: Oh, so that’s why. … You will too.”In her blog post, Walker explicitly lauded Icke’s ideas about the lizard people who control the world. She wrote:The Reptilian space beings whose hybrid (part human, part reptile) descendants make our lives hell in Paradise were blue eyed devils to Malcolm X, the devil himself to my Christian parents, who never talked about eye color, which I think was not only prudent but wise, although they seemed clear enough about his sex, and as demons in many other religions, including the non-religion, Buddhism, where the advice is often to invite them in until they go away. But maybe these were other kinds of demons. Not the ones controlling not just you, but everything.Walker has since endorsed Icke numerous times on her blog, and even recommended an interview he did with Alex Jones, who also promotes racist conspiracy theories, in 2015. “I like these two because they’re real, and sometimes Alex Jones is a bit crazy; many Aquarians are,” Walker explained. “Icke only appears crazy to people who don’t appreciate the stubbornness required when one is called to a duty it is impossible to evade.”In 2017, Walker published a poem on her blog called “To Study the Talmud.” The Talmud is an extremely old book of Jewish law, very long and confusing and contradictory, and anti-Semites frequently quote it out of context in order to “prove” that Jews condone pedophilia and the murder of Christians. (For the record: They do not!) Walker’s poem follows in the same tradition. In Walker’s poem, she describes turning to the Talmud to understand Israel, which she describes as “demonic / To the core,” and finding the very worst: Are Goyim (us) meant to be slaves of Jews, and not onlyThat, but to enjoy it?Are three year old (and a day) girls eligible for marriage and intercourse?Are young boys fair game for rape?Must even the best of the Goyim (us, again) be killed?Pause a moment and think what this could meanOr already has meantIn our own lifetime.Walker also advises her readers to supplement their reading of the Talmud with their own research. She means a specific kind of research, though: If her readers just look at Google, most of what they find will be “slanted, unfortunately.” Instead, she writes:For a more in depth studyI recommend starting with YouTube. Simply follow the trail of “TheTalmud” as its poison belatedly winds its wayInto our collective consciousness.We can’t know for sure what is going on in Walker’s mind, but it sure sounds like she is describing the process of her own radicalization here. As Jane Coaston has written for Vox, YouTube has a conspiracy theory problem: The site’s algorithms are designed to keep users engaged, and that means they tend to feed users ever more extreme and radical content. As a result, videos peddling conspiracy theories — especially bigoted conspiracy theories — get amplified on YouTube. Basically, it sure seems like Alice Walker, legendary activist and author, went looking for some critiques of Israeli politics and ended up getting “redpilled” on YouTube into becoming an anti-Semite by a person who doesn’t believe in the moon. (In far-right discourse, “taking the red pill” or having been “redpilled” implies that someone has “woken up” to a worldview that includes the belief that feminism is ruining everything and frequently involves anti-Semitic and white supremacist dog-whistling.)Now she’s amplifying Icke’s voice. And though it doesn’t seem to have been her goal to cause a controversy, if it had been, then the New York Times Book Review’s By the Book column was a weirdly perfect place for her to do so.In his Tablet article, Rosenberg specifically criticizes the New York Times for not pushing back against Walker’s endorsement of Icke in the moment. “This [Walker’s recommendation of Icke] passed without comment from the New York Times interviewer,” he writes, “and the publication passed it on to readers without qualification. This is rather remarkable because the book is an unhinged anti-Semitic conspiracy tract written by one of Britain’s most notorious anti-Semites.”Rosenberg’s criticism also represents a heightened version of the kind of criticism that gets the By the Book column into trouble all the time.The By the Book column is a weekly feature in the New York Times Book Review, and for such an anodyne-sounding column, it has long been a magnet for controversy. Every week, the Times Book Review emails an author a list of questions to answer, mostly about their favorite books. The list of questions always includes a few standards — including the “what’s on your nightstand” question that prompted Walker to recommend Icke — and the Times never comments on the answers. Nearly every week, this column makes people mad. The most common critique of the By the Book column is that the men interviewed in the column almost never mention books by women, and the numbers bear out this critique: According to a recent study by UC Berkeley assistant professor David Bamman, men interviewed in “By the Book” mention men four times more frequently than they do women. (Women tend to mention men and women equally.) This year, Electric Literature invented a Read More Women recommendation series explicitly as a feminist corrective to By the Book’s dude-heavy track record. But there are other criticisms nearly every time a new By the Book column publishes. Just a few weeks ago, senator and novelist Ben Sasse remarked in his By the Book interview that he doesn’t read much modern fiction and recommended his “family canon.” While the full list of 60 books features authors of color, the 33 books Sasse cites in the column itself are all by white authors. The Splinter called the interview “psychotic”; the Chicago Tribune, more measured, described Sasse’s rules as “a bad idea.” In a Q&A with the Times after the backlash against the Walker interview, Book Review editor Pamela Paul said it is the Times’s policy not to comment on the books that authors mention in By the Book. “We would never add that a book is factually inaccurate, or that the author is a serial predator, or any kind of judgment on the work or the writer. We do not issue a verdict on people’s opinions,” she explained, adding, “If people espouse beliefs that anyone at The Times finds to be dangerous or immoral, it’s important for readers to be aware that they hold those beliefs. The public deserves to know. That’s news.” All of this means that the By the Book column is consistently a place where America’s public intellectuals expose their blind spots as readers — via whose voices they think are worth amplifying and whose are worth ignoring — while the New York Times discreetly declines to comment. In this case, Alice Walker wasn’t just exposing a blind spot. She was publicly recommending a book that is filled with bigoted conspiracy theories.But because Walker made her perspective clear on a platform that often catches America’s public intellectuals in their unguarded thoughts, rather than on her relatively private personal blog, for the first time, it became unignorable to the public at large. So here’s where we’re left: One of the most beloved writers and activists in the American letters recommended a writer of bigoted conspiracy theories to the public at large, after hiding her beliefs in plain sight for years, and she did so in the paper of record without any pushback. As a result, Alice Walker’s acceptance of anti-Semitic beliefs has been exposed to a lot of people who previously had no idea she felt this way — which, as Paul pointed out, “is news.” But she has also amplified David Icke’s message, and because the New York Times Book Review printed her recommendation uncritically in accordance with the policy of its By the Book column, the Times is complicit in that amplification as well. There’s every possibility that people who aren’t aware of Walker’s history or the nature of Icke’s work might seek out his book on the strength of Walker’s New York Times recommendation, and that they might potentially get drawn into Icke’s way of seeing the world.

A timeline of Israel and Palestine’s complicated history,2023-10-19,Vox,['Nicole Narea'],"Filed under:To understand the Israel-Hamas war, you have to understand how we got here. Hamas’s attack on Israel, and Israel’s offensive in Gaza in response, is yet another escalation in a long conflict that has already left thousands dead on both sides. The latest round of violence between Israel and Palestine began after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched the deadliest attack on Israel ever on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people, and capturing nearly 200, by the latest estimates. Israel responded with an intense counteroffensive that included an order to carry out a “complete siege” of Gaza, and it appears to be readying for a ground assault.Israeli airstrikes have already devastated many civilian areas, and the death toll in Gaza is growing amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Foreign passport holders in Gaza and aid convoys carrying life-saving supplies from Egypt have lined up at the Egyptian border crossing waiting for an agreement that would allow the border to open, but that has so far failed to materialize.The death and destruction are the bloody culmination of decades of fighting rooted in a complicated history. To understand the current violence, you have to understand how we got here. If you’re just catching up, here are the key dates that have led up to this critical inflection point. The 1800s were a time of great colonial expansion as European empires jockeyed to take over other parts of the world, including the Middle East. As early as the 1840s, the British saw Palestine as an opportunity to carve out a sphere of influence in the Middle East, where they were competing with the French and Russians. But it wasn’t until World War I, in which they were fighting the Ottomans who controlled Palestine, that the British formalized their support for the idea of a Jewish state in the region.In its 1917 Balfour Declaration, the British government unilaterally called for the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine, despite the fact that Jewish people made up less than 15 percent of the population there at the time. Though the declaration vowed that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” it did not outline what those communities were, what specific rights they had, or how they would be protected, and it didn’t take their thoughts about how their land should be used into account. The Allied powers in the war backed the declaration, and after the war, the newly created League of Nations gave Britain a mandate to temporarily rule Palestine until the Jewish state could be created. The British thereafter adopted immigration policies that encouraged more than 100,000 Jews to immigrate over the next two decades. Jews had been persecuted in Europe for centuries, but in the early 1900s, antisemitism reached a fever pitch across the continent, particularly in Germany. By the 1930s, it had became a tool of populism and the official policy of the Nazis. As the Nazi Party completed its takeover of the German government, it enacted hundreds of decrees and laws that targeted Jews as “enemies of the state” in Germany, and gradually ramped up an assault on Jewish rights. At first, Nazis barred Jews from a swath of industries ranging from civil service to acting. Then, they prohibited Jews from marrying people of “German or German-related blood,” prevented them from obtaining citizenship in the German Reich or earning a living, and expropriated Jewish property and sold it to Nazi party officials at low prices. The Nazis’ objective was to make life so terrible for Jews that they would leave — and about a quarter of German Jews had by 1938.That year, before World War II officially began, Germany annexed Austria and brought another 185,000 Jews under Nazi rule. Though many of them wanted to flee, few countries would have them. Representatives from 32 countries convened in Evian, France, to discuss resettlement. But while many of them expressed sympathy for Jewish refugees, most of them declined to take them in, including the US and Britain. As Jewish refugees looked for a place to go, Zionists — activists in a movement seeking a permanent home for Jewish people — advertised and agitated for immigration to Palestine. For years, prominent Zionists had called for a Jewish state in Palestine (rather than Uganda or any other nation sometimes suggested) because of the region’s religious and historical significance to Jewish people. And the area proved popular, with the Jewish population of British-ruled Palestine increasing by more than 160,000 between 1932 and 1935 alone.The influx put stress on the British occupation, and on the Palestinians already living in the area, leading to volatile and violent encounters between Palestinian and British troops, as well as their immigrant militia allies. The British even imposed harsh new immigration quotas in Palestine after seeing a record number of immigrants in 1935 driven by Nazi persecution of Jews. Those quotas remained for the duration of the war, sealing the fate of many of the 6 million Jews ultimately murdered in the Holocaust who had nowhere safe to go.Revisionist Zionist terrorists — who went further than other Zionists in calling for a Jewish state focused on maximal territorial expansionism through force, and who were unhappy with British attempts to stem the violence by limiting immigration — also sowed chaos. All of this led to Britain looking for an eventual exit from Palestine.After World War II, tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors began moving to Palestine, encouraged by a strengthened Zionist movement. The United Nations agreed to partition Palestine into two states, one for the area’s Jewish population and another for the Arab population, with the city of Jerusalem to be governed by a special international entity. However, local Arabs and Arab countries objected to the plan. Following a period of extreme violence before, during, and after the war — particularly on the part of Zionist militias — British forces withdrew from Palestine, and Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948. That started the first Arab-Israeli war, in which Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria — opponents of Israel’s declaration of independence — invaded the country. Though the US immediately recognized the new provisional Israeli government, it did not get involved in the conflict militarily. Israel won the war and with it, 77 percent of the previous Palestinian mandate territory, including land that the UN had intended to allocate to the Arabs. During the Arab-Israeli war, and in the militia attacks that preceded it, more than 700,000 Palestinians were forced to flee and approximately 15,000 were killed in what Palestinians refer to as the “Nakba,” Arabic for “catastrophe.” It’s a formative event for Palestinian identity and has been observed annually in the years since — including by the United Nations for the first time in 2023. Some have warned that the current Israeli offensive in Gaza, in which more than 1 million Palestinians have been told by Israel to flee, is amounting to a “second Nakba.”In 1954, Israel sought to carry out a covert operation against Egypt. The so-called “Lavon affair,” named for Israel’s then-defense minister, involved planting bombs inside targets owned by Egyptian, American, and British civilians with the intention of detonating them after the facilities closed and placing the blame on nationalist malcontents, including the Muslim Brotherhood. Israeli operatives recruited Egyptian Jews to carry the plan out. Their objective was to stir up sufficient strife so as to persuade the British to keep their forces in Egypt at a moment when the two countries were negotiating Britain’s exit from the Suez Canal. Israel feared that Britain’s departure would embolden Egypt militarily in the region, threatening the new state. But after detonating the bombs, Israel’s operatives were caught. Two died by suicide in prison, and another two were executed by Egypt. Others faced lengthy prison sentences.Egypt’s treatment of the saboteurs led Israel to launch a retaliatory incursion into Gaza, then controlled by Egypt, and Egypt took steps to better arm itself against the Israelis. After the US and Britain refused Egypt’s request for military assistance, Egypt turned to the Soviet Union, which provided that assistance. That made the US and Britain furious, and they consequently withdrew funding in 1956 for Egypt’s Aswan Dam project, which was the largest dam project in the world along the Nile. Egypt retaliated by nationalizing the Suez Canal, which made it difficult for Western nations to access trade routes and their colonies, setting off what is now known as the “Suez Crisis” or the “Tripartite Aggression.”That conflict saw Israel, and then Britain and France, invade Egypt and Gaza in order to reclaim control of the Suez Canal and remove the Egyptian president, Gamal Abdel Nasser. But following pressure from the US and UN, those forces withdrew, and Nasser remained in power. There was no peace treaty after the conflict, and tensions between Egypt and Israel remained high, setting the stage for the country’s next conflict. The UN also stationed peacekeeping forces along the Egypt-Israel border. The 1967 war, also known as the Six-Day War, reshaped the Middle East and established Israel as a dominant military power in the region. It was the culmination of long-brewing tensions in the region between Israel and other regional powers. The conflict started after Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli vessels amid disagreements with the Israelis over water rights. But other actors also saw reason to get involved: Syria, which was engaged in territorial disputes with Israel over the Golan Heights border region, supported Palestinian guerillas in leading incursions into Israel. Jordan entered into a defense pact with Egypt to show solidarity with Arab states against Israel, and wanted to reclaim territory it had lost in the 1948 war.The conflict saw Israel defeat all of those countries, suffering comparatively few casualties in the process with little help from outside forces, and occupy swaths of new territory, including Gaza, the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula, parts of East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. It did so by launching a preemptive strike on Egypt, destroying much of the country’s air force before it left the ground and giving Israel the aerial advantage.The US had been concerned about Soviet influence in the region, particularly in Egypt, and worried that the conflict could have expanded into a Cold War proxy battle if it had escalated further. But Israel put a quick end to it  — and made itself an attractive ally at a moment when the US wanted to squash communism everywhere, but was preoccupied with the Vietnam War and did not have the bandwidth to get involved militarily in the Middle East. The end of the Six-Day War marked the beginning of the US and Israel’s relationship as close allies. The UN adopted a resolution at the end of the war, known as UN Resolution 242, that called on Arab countries to recognize Israel’s right to “live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force,” as well as calling for Israel to withdraw from “territories occupied” in the conflict. Israel, Egypt, and Jordan all came to accept the resolution, and it formed the basis of peace talks in the decades thereafter, despite the fact that its tenets were never fully implemented. However, the agreement wasn’t accepted by Palestinian militants. The decade thereafter saw them turn to terrorism as a tactic against the Israelis. In 1972, for instance, Palestinian “Black September” gunmen killed 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics.Egypt and Syria launched a simultaneous, surprise attack on Israel on October 6, 1973, with the intention of forcing the country to the negotiating table to cede control of the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. Israel had occupied Syria’s Golan Heights, located on Israel’s eastern border with Syria, and Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, located along Israel’s southern border, since the Six-Day War. The attack marked the beginning of what is called the Yom Kippur War because it commenced on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism.The war was a shock to Israelis who, having just a few years before handily defeated their Arab neighbors, were caught unprepared. Many have drawn parallels between the Yom Kippur War and Hamas’s 2023 attack, in that respect. After quickly depleting their reserves of munitions, the Israelis turned to the US for help. Though initially reluctant to engage, then-US President Richard Nixon sent Israel supplies and equipment when he found out that the Soviet Union was helping resupply Egypt and Syria. A UN-brokered ceasefire ended the fighting a few weeks later.But it wasn’t until 1978 that Egypt and Israel, with the help of then-US President Jimmy Carter, arrived at a framework for lasting peace in the Camp David Accords. The accords were the blueprint for the peace treaty that the two countries signed the following year, in which Israel agreed to withdraw from Sinai and Egypt opened the Suez Canal to Israeli ships that had been previously blocked.In the 1980s, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was a coalition of Palestinian nationalists that had been exchanging fire with Israeli forces along the Lebanese border. They used Lebanon, home to many Palestinian exiles, as their base between the 1960s and early 1980s, though were unaffiliated with the Lebanese government. In 1982, the Iraq-based Abu Nidal group — a brutal, militant offshoot of the PLO — orchestrated an assassination attempt on Israel’s ambassador to Britain, who was a passionate advocate for the Israeli state. Israeli forces cited the failed assassination when seeking the elimination of all Palestinian groups from Lebanon thereafter. At great human cost, Israel invaded southern Lebanon, conducting a prolonged siege on the Lebanese capital of Beirut that led to many civilian casualties and widespread destruction. Israeli officials also permitted allied Lebanese Christian militias to enter the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in Beirut in order to root out PLO fighters. While Israeli soldiers had the camps surrounded, those Christian militias — which hated the Muslim Palestinians — massacred hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians. Those incidents were widely condemned by the international community.The war officially ended with a US-brokered agreement in 1983, which allowed the PLO to relocate to Tunisia. But Lebanon remained unstable. American and French peacekeeping forces, stationed in Lebanon to ensure the safety of the PLO as they exited and the remaining Palestinians, withdrew from Lebanon following the 1983 bombing of their Beirut barracks by Islamic Jihad, a Lebanese Shia militant group. Israel also gradually withdrew from Lebanon starting in 1985 and created a security zone in southern Lebanon, which it occupied for years. That area ultimately became a hot spot of terrorist activity by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shia militant group that opposes Israel.In 1987, Palestinian frustrations had reached a boiling point following the war in Lebanon and the construction of new Israeli settlements and increased repression by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians staged an intifada, Arabic for “shaking off,” of Israeli oppression, engaging in nonviolent mass protests that often turned into violent clashes with Israeli security forces.The uprising continued until the early 1990s, at which point about 2,000 people had been killed. With the support of the US and other nations, Israeli and Palestinian leaders began negotiating a peaceful end to the conflict. In 1991, representatives from the US, Soviet Union, Israel, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, as well as non-PLO Palestinian delegates, convened for the first time in Madrid to hold negotiations that created the framework for the peace process. That eventually culminated in the Oslo Accords, signed in 1993, which allowed Palestinians to self-govern in the West Bank and Gaza and established the Palestinian Authority as the government of those areas. Israel agreed to withdraw its security forces from those areas, and in exchange, the PLO recognized the state of Israel and the right of its citizens to live in peace. The Oslo Accords were supposed to set the stage for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within five years. But that solution never came to be. The Second Intifada brought an end to the era of peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians throughout the 1990s. It began with right-wing Israeli Likud party leader Ariel Sharon’s visit to the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, a holy site for Muslims — as well as for Jews, who know it as the Temple Mount. Sharon was a staunch advocate of Israeli sovereignty, and Palestinians perceived his visit as a provocation because he was accompanied by Israeli police.Palestinians started protesting, initially mostly peacefully. Israel responded to the protests by firing at protesters with rubber bullets and later live ammunition, and sent tanks and helicopters into Palestinian areas. Within a month, the protests had morphed into violent resistance, escalating to suicide bombings and shootings inside Israel’s internationally recognized borders. In response, Israel reentered Gaza and the West Bank, ending the post-Oslo status quo, and constructed a reinforced security barrier.A ceasefire was declared in 2003, but not before significant loss of life. More than 4,300 people died, mostly Palestinians, and the intifada caused billions in economic damage. Multiple attempts at peacemaking — the Mitchell Report, the Tenet Plan, and the road map to peace — failed to gain traction in this period.Sharon became prime minister in 2001, and in 2005, his government announced an Israeli “disengagement plan” for Gaza that involved the complete unilateral withdrawal of Israeli settlements and military forces. Approximately 8,500 Israeli settlers — some of whom had lived there for decades and resisted the plan — were removed from their homes, and some of them were compensated. Israel ceded control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas. It also vacated four Israeli settlements in the West Bank.The objective of the withdrawal was to improve Israel’s security and create the conditions for lasting peace. Essentially, the idea was that removing soldiers and settlers from the equation would deescalate the situation and allow for real peace talks. But that wouldn’t come to pass.As part of the Oslo Accords, the occupied Palestinian territories — Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem — were meant to be governed in part by the PA’s legislative branch, which has power over civil matters, internal security, and public order. For all of its existence up until 2006, the PA had been dominated by the secular Fatah party, which recognizes the state of Israel and has sought to negotiate with it after renouncing armed resistance in the 1990s. That changed in the 2006 elections when Hamas won a majority of council seats.Because of Hamas’s history of armed confrontation with Israel and its objective of destroying the Israeli state overall, the international community refused to recognize the Hamas-led government. The US went on to organize a violent coup against Hamas, promising $86 million in military assistance to Fatah commander Mohammed Dahlan’s forces. After the two parties failed to reach a lasting power-sharing agreement, a brief civil war broke out between the military wings of Hamas and Fatah, as well as their allied militias. Hamas defeated Fatah’s forces, and though the group’s democratically elected lawmakers were expelled from the legislative council, Hamas took control of Gaza while Fatah kept control of the West Bank. Israel instituted a blockade of Gaza thereafter. Later that year, Hamas kidnapped Gilad Shalit, a soldier in the Israeli military, and took him into Gaza. The Israeli army launched airstrikes at Gaza in response, and it wasn’t until 2011 that they were finally able to secure his release by exchanging more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.The year 2006 also brought conflict in Lebanon. With the stated hope of advancing the Palestinians’ cause, Hezbollah attacked Israeli soldiers, and Israel responded with airstrikes targeting Hezbollah’s operations in Lebanon, along with limited ground incursions in southern Lebanon. And Hezbollah, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the US, shot back with a barrage of rockets that hit several cities in northern Israel. The crossfire went on for a month, displacing hundreds of thousands of Israeli and Lebanese civilians from their homes and resulting in more than 1,150 casualties total on both sides.The fighting ended with a UN resolution that required Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while 30,000 Lebanese and UN peacekeeping troops took over the area to prevent the rearming of Hezbollah. Israel began developing its Iron Dome short-range missile defense system in response to the conflict.Despite agreeing to a ceasefire with Hamas just months prior, Israeli soldiers launched a raid into Gaza to kill Hamas militants in November 2008. That led to increased tensions and Israel’s decision to launch Operation Cast Lead, a weeks-long assault on Gaza involving aerial bombing and a ground invasion. The casualty figures are disputed, but it left at least 1,000 Palestinians and 12 Israelis dead. It also caused severe damage to housing, businesses, and electrical infrastructure in Gaza. UN officials later found that the Israeli military committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the operation, including using white phosphorus in populated areas and intentionally targeting civilians. The UN said that Palestinian militants had also committed war crimes by shooting rockets at Israeli civilians. Violence flared up again in 2012, after an increase in Hamas rockets launched from Gaza to Israel. Israel retaliated with eight days of airstrikes and killed the head of Hamas’s military wing. Almost 180 people, mostly civilians, died in the fighting. Both sides again were found to have committed war crimes by the UN. Though Egypt helped broker a ceasefire, it was short-lived.In 2014, Hamas kidnapped and killed three Israeli teens from the West Bank. In response, Israel launched airstrikes, ground operations, and naval blockades in Gaza. Though Israel’s stated target was Hamas militants and their infrastructure, thousands of Palestinians were killed in the fighting, which persisted for seven weeks. Hamas launched rockets of its own into Israel, most of which were intercepted by the Iron Dome. Again, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt ended the conflict. But it left Gaza with significant infrastructure damage and shortages of basic necessities, with no end to the Israeli blockade in sight. At least 2,200 people were killed, the vast majority of whom were civilians in Gaza. Outbreaks of violence continued in the years thereafter.Another major outbreak of violence occurred in 2021, after Israel threatened to evict Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem — home to holy sites of significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims — and Israeli police imposed restrictions around the al-Aqsa Mosque during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian protesters and Israeli police violently clashed in East Jerusalem, giving way to a broader conflict. Hamas fired rockets at Jerusalem, and Israel responded with airstrikes on Gaza. Again, Israel stated it only wanted to target Hamas and its infrastructure, but its offensive resulted in more than 200 civilian casualties.After 11 days, the fighting ended with a ceasefire brokered by Egypt and Qatar. But Palestinian frustrations were left unaddressed, and outbreaks of violence between the Israelis and Palestinian militants continued.In recent years, Israel has been a key pillar of the US’s stated goal to create an “integrated, prosperous, and secure Middle East” as it looks to move on from long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to turn its focus to other parts of the world, including Russia and China. Though US-led talks between Israel and the PA froze in 2014, the Trump administration facilitated agreements to “normalize” relations between Israel and several of its Muslim-majority neighbors, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco. These normalization efforts are aimed at establishing diplomatic and economic channels between the countries. The Biden administration also sought to normalize relations between Israel and its main regional rival Saudi Arabia so that they could form a united front against Iran, a common adversary that financially supports Hamas. Hamas’s brutal attack on October 7 and Israel’s brutal response in Gaza, however, seem to have derailed that progress toward stability in the Middle East. This Israel-Hamas war has been the deadliest yet for both sides. Both Israel and Hamas seem to have already committed war crimes. Israel, projecting strength in the face of its failure to thwart Hamas’s attack, wants to eliminate Hamas for good and has proved willing to claim civilian lives to achieve that. Mass protests have broken out worldwide, including in neighboring Arab nations that see the US as complicit in Israel’s atrocities against Palestinians. There are fears that the war could broaden to Lebanon as violence with Hezbollah flares up along Israel’s northern border. And Iran has threatened “preemptive action” by the “resistance front,” seemingly referring to Islamist militant groups such as Hezbollah, against Israel as it gears up for a ground invasion.It’s hard to see a way out now. Any ceasefire may hinge on the US exercising its influence over Israel to stop the violence and keep the conflict from escalating further.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
How to think morally about the Israel-Hamas war,2023-10-11,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Massacring civilians is neither decolonization nor self-defense.In southern Israel, Hamas terrorists broke into a room where a family of five was hiding and slaughtered every one of them. In Gaza, a father wrapped in gauze held his child, butchered in an Israeli strike, for the last time.These scenes pose a very simple moral test: Do you believe that it is wrong for innocent people to suffer in this way? That mass death should be deplored, not defended, regardless of who its victims are? If the answer to either of those questions is no, then you are a morally broken person.Depressingly, the Israel-Palestine discourse has exposed many of them.Almost immediately after news of the attack broke, celebrations broke out among a group of Western leftists, hailing Hamas’s incursion as an act of “decolonization.” This was not merely a handful of isolated individuals, but included journalists with large followings, professors, and student organizations at elite universities. At a rally supported by the Democratic Socialists in America in New York, the crowd cheered Hamas’s success.This cheerleading for murderous terrorists is ghoulish and self-discrediting: “a betrayal of the left’s most fundamental values,” as New York magazine’s Eric Levitz writes.It is also, in a way, revealing. The moral failures of the fringe left show us how not to think about the ongoing horrors in Israel and Gaza — and, in doing so, point to a better way.Currently, the Israeli government is preparing a ground invasion of Gaza that threatens to come with unimaginable human costs. The callousness with which they are talking about civilian deaths in Gaza is appalling. An anonymous Israeli official told Israeli reporter Alon Ben David that their response would turn Gaza into “a city of tents.” A parliamentarian from the ruling Likud party said, on national television, that Israel should not concern itself with the safety of any Gazans who “chose” to stay in the Gaza Strip. (With crossings into Egypt and Israel blocked, Gazans could not leave if they wanted.)This, too, is evil. I do not pretend to know exactly what the right choice is for Israel going forward. But I know that if the Israeli Defense Forces do slaughter civilians indiscriminately, the Israeli government will be committing abuses on moral par with those of Hamas. I also know that justice for Israelis and Palestinians cannot be found through a mode of thinking that says only one kind of life is holy. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]We are not limited to a binary choice between the murderous theocrats of Hamas and the murderous theocrats of Israel’s far right. There are good people, kind people, in both Israel and the Palestinian territories — brave souls looking to help those on the other side, amid unspeakable tragedy, and together make the land they share safe for everyone. Some of those people have already been killed by the other side; more will likely die in the coming days.Those of us outside the region need to follow their moral example. Only by grounding our vision in universal humanity, the idea that every life is sacred and all people deserve our respect, can we ever figure out a way to break the cycle of violence dragging Israelis and Palestinians into hell.The language of mass murder we’re hearing is intentionally bloodless.When the Israeli military kills Palestinians, they speak of “collateral damage,” not families blown apart. When the defense minister talks about cutting off electricity and water to Gaza, he speaks only of fighting Hamas “animals” — not of the hospital patients and formula-fed babies likely to die as a consequence.You see the same among Hamas’s Western apologists. They do not gleefully post pictures of Israeli children executed in their beds. Instead, they cheer pictures of Hamas breaking down the border fence with Gaza, calling it “decolonization” — ignoring that Hamas fighters broke down those fences to commit intolerable acts of mass slaughter.A case in point of this moral evasion is an essay by Tariq Ali, a prominent British public intellectual. Ali’s essay furiously goes through a litany of abuses committed by Israel against Palestinians, all real enough and worthy of condemnation. But when he gets to the actual actions of Hamas, he retreats to pure abstraction instead of talking about Hamas gunning down teens at a music festival.  “The elected leadership in Gaza begins to fight back,” Ali crowed, asserting their right to do so “by any means necessary.”By. Any. Means. Necessary. Four words, a phrase hardly unique to Ali, that gives away the game. Ali and his fellow travelers are not engaging in an intellectual discussion about whether there is a version of Palestinian armed resistance to Israeli occupation that could be justified. They are responding to a specific act, the mass slaughter of families and festivalgoers, and saying that we are in no position to judge them. “By any means necessary,” they say — the mirror image of Israeli hawks who believe their own security can be found in the wholesale slaughter of Gaza’s population.The linguistic pathologies reflect an inability to confront the conflict as it actually is. The language used is abstract and divorced from practical consequence because engaging with reality, with hard, cold human suffering, would disrupt the neat ideological picture that allows one to bask in one’s own moral righteousness.Hamas and its Western leftist apologists point to Israel’s overwhelming power, together with its blockade of Gaza and indefensible colonization of the West Bank, and see a power imbalance that makes it impossible for Palestinians to triumph in anything like a conventional war. So they ask: How do you want us to resist? What can we do when we are so weak?Israeli hardliners and their foreign allies ask essentially the same question. We are facing remorseless murderers who once used a hospital as their de facto headquarters, they say. We have a right to defend ourselves, and it is Hamas’s fault — not ours — that innocent Palestinians will die.You can see where both of these perspectives are coming from. It’s true that Israel has overwhelming power and is using it to victimize Palestinians on a daily basis, turning Gaza into an open-air prison and colonizing the West Bank. It’s also true that Hamas is a vicious group dedicated to a violently antisemitic worldview, one that has no qualms about brutalizing Palestinians and putting weapons in civilian-populated areas.But by taking one set of facts in isolation of the other, hardliners on both sides displace their own moral obligations. By asserting the unerring righteousness of their own cause, they excuse themselves from having to think about the consequences of their actions. Because we are in the right, the logic goes, we are justified in acting however we see fit — and are under no obligation to deal with the messy details of actual humans we harm. In the quest to defend one’s own side, language is turned into a tool of immorality. It allows them to celebrate their enemies’ deaths without guilt.Among some on the Western left, a subtly different position has also emerged — not pro-Hamas terrorism, exactly, but anti-anti-Hamas.The basic idea is that condemning Hamas from afar is pointless, in that it does not work to secure any concrete political end. We in the West, rather, have an obligation to point out the way in which our own government’s support for Israel has created the conditions for apartheid and ongoing violence. “The only meaningful contribution Americans can make to stopping the violence is by confronting at every opportunity the vast public conspiracy of silence about the [Israeli] occupation,” writes Gabriel Winant, a historian at Yale University. “That’s the only thing we can do that has any consequence beyond seeing to our own conscience.”This is untrue for any number of reasons.For one, condemning Hamas’s evils — and that fraction of leftists willing to celebrate them — is vital for the still-weak American left to become anything more than a small fringe group speaking only to and for itself. For another, it is important to call out concepts that may have some value — like “decolonization” — when they evolve into justifications for horrible violence, as a matter of ensuring the left does not, as a collective, lose sight of the ideals of universal human equality it claims to stand for. For a third, it risks forfeiting moral standing in the eyes of others when the left goes on to condemn Israeli human rights abuses later in this conflict.But I want to focus on a fourth error, one that applies as much to Israel’s hardline supporters as its enemies: the mistaken idea that advocating for “our side,” or the evils of the other, is the correct role for outsiders in the Israel-Palestine discourse.For anyone whose brain has not been broken by the fever dreams of Israeli and Palestinian radicals, there is only one way this decades-old conflict ends: with Israelis and Palestinians, including their leadership, finding a way to live in peace. Personally, I think that is only achievable in a two-state solution; other reasonable observers disagree. But the baseline assumption that underpins any feasible solution is that, somehow, the two sides can see the dignity and humanity in the other.Our role, as foreigners, should be to help foster this belief. This does not mean mealy-mouthed statements about peace, but specific interventions designed to push our individual governments toward fostering that sense of respect.I agree with Winant, broadly, that American policy prior to this conflict has been far too tolerant of the deepening of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. After the current emergency, the Biden administration ought to reconsider what it can do to put pressure on Israel to cease its cruel and counterproductive policies.This moment, to put it mildly, is not a time when anything like that will happen. But what we can do now is bolster the forces who support peace and equality on the Israeli side in other ways.Israelis will never feel safe making concessions if they don’t, well, feel safe. One of the most powerful tools available to Israel’s own extremists is a perception that the world doesn’t care about Israelis and Jews, that Israelis are on their own and need to do whatever it takes to protect their lives from Palestinian extremists. Legitimate Israeli security fears, especially in the wake of the worst catastrophe in the country’s history, need to be taken seriously by anyone who cares about Israelis and Palestinians. I think that’s part of why the Israeli leftists I know and speak with, people who risk their own safety and security to criticize the occupation, are so appalled by the defenses of Hamas terrorism: In denying Israeli humanity, these critics do damage to the cause of peace.More broadly, we need as outside observers to maintain basic human values in ourselves: to see the victims on both sides as humans, to care about suffering, and to attune our statements and activities toward finding ways forward that can improve the situation. If we allow ourselves to slide into moral solipsism, we won’t merely justify atrocities; we will blind ourselves to the steps that can be taken to actually make life better on the ground.We can and should extend sympathy to Israeli victims, but we should not let that shade into justification for retaliatory atrocities. We should condemn Hamas terrorism, but we should also condemn Israeli abuses against Gazans. Of the many examples of international official statements I’ve seen, the one issued by Canada’s New Democratic Party (NDP) — the country’s left-wing third party — is among the best at threading this needle. It’s worth reading the whole thing, including the condemnation of justification for terrorism, but putting these two paragraphs back-to-back really captures the heart of the issue:The terrorist attacks by Hamas on thousands of innocent Israeli civilians are unjustifiable. We are shocked by the brutality, missile attacks, kidnappings, and targeting of civilians including the elderly and children. These are war crimes and must be prosecuted. We call for the immediate safe return of all hostages and call on the government of Canada to do everything in its power to ensure the release of Canadians among the captives.This morning, Israel’s ground operation into Gaza commenced. Civilians in Gaza are caught in a horrific cycle of violence; like the Israeli civilians killed over the past few days, Gazans are victims of Hamas’ brutality. Israel’s bombardment of civilian homes and infrastructure in Gaza, where over half the population are children, has killed hundreds of Palestinians with entire families wiped out. The next hours may be the deadliest Gaza has ever seen. Canada must urgently insist that Israel respect international law and protect the lives of innocent Palestinian civilians who bear no responsibility for Hamas’ terror.The NDP’s comments show the way forward, for the left and really, everyone: exercise moral judgment, not partisan loyalty. Criticize Israel when it slaughters Palestinians, and criticize Palestinians when they slaughter Israelis. Note the asymmetries — both Israel’s vastly superior power and Hamas’s much greater disregard for rules about targeting civilians — but do not allow those differences to obscure the most basic moral truth: that human suffering is, in and of itself, wrong. This is not just how we say the right things about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: It’s how we, in the end, will figure out how best to contribute to peace down the line. To think otherwise, and find fault only with one side, leads to the moral oblivion of cheering the slaughter of children.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Israel is deporting a human rights activist over his BDS support,2019-04-16,Vox,['Salwa Sadek'],"Filed under:Omar Shakir was ordered deported by an Israeli court over Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) activism. An Israeli court has ordered the expulsion of the Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch, a US-based NGO that advocates for human rights, citing “his actions publicly to advance a boycott against Israel.” Omar Shakir, a US citizen, has been given two weeks to leave the country, the AP reports.Shakir’s case is merely the latest example of the Israeli government’s growing crackdown on activists over their advocacy of or connections to the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Last week, Omar Barghouti, a founder of the BDS movement, was attempting to fly from Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport to the US for a speaking tour when he was informed that his US visa had been revoked for unspecified “immigration reasons” — a move he decried as “ideologically and politically motivated” and the result of Israel’s “escalating repression against Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights defenders.”US State Department spokesperson Robert Palladino declined to provide details about Barghouti’s case citing confidentiality restrictions, but told reporters at the time that US law does not “authorize the refusal of visas based solely on political statements or views if those statements or views would be lawful in the United States, no matter how distasteful or objectionable some may find those statements or views.”Israeli law, though, is a different story. In 2017, the country passed a law banning any foreigner from entering the country if that individual “knowingly issues a public call for boycotting Israel.” Tuesday’s ruling against Human Rights Watch’s Shakir marks the first time that law has been applied to someone already residing in the country.The court said Shakir “continues his actions publicly to advance a boycott against Israel ... through disseminating his calls to advance boycott primarily through his Twitter account and by other means.”In a statement, Human Rights Watch said neither the organization nor Shakir promotes boycotts of Israel, but acknowledged that both have called for companies to cease operations in West Bank settlements because they “inherently benefit from and contribute to serious violations of international humanitarian law.”It added that the court’s ruling “threatens the ability of all Human Rights Watch staff members to access both Israel and the West Bank.”These recent events of “banning” two prominent activists because of their activism and beliefs has raised concerns about whether human rights activists who speak out against Israeli policies are having their right to free speech suppressed. At least 27 states in the US have adopted laws to combat BDS activism, according to Palestine Legal, an independent legal advocacy organization, founded in 2012 and dedicated to supporting the movement for Palestinian rights. Earlier this year, the US Senate passed a bill that included an anti-BDS provision. Known as Title 4, the provision would give states a legal blessing to punish companies that choose not to do business with Israel or Israeli-owned enterprises, a key demand of the BDS movement.But while that bill has not yet become law in the US (and will likely face stiff pushback from House Democrats), Israeli law has already gone much further, as Tuesday’s action against Shakir shows. “Israel portrays itself as the region’s only democracy, but is set to deport a rights defender over his peaceful advocacy,” Tom Porteous, deputy program director at Human Rights Watch, wrote in a statement about the Shakir ruling. “The decision sends the chilling message that those who criticize the involvement of businesses in serious abuses in Israeli settlements risk being barred from Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank,” he continued.And indeed, that seems to be the point. Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan, whose ministry leads anti-boycott efforts, praised the ruling. “Boycott activists need to understand that what was will no longer be,” he said.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The controversial US Jerusalem embassy opening, explained",2018-05-14,Vox,['Alexia Underwood'],"Filed under:As the embassy event took place, Israeli soldiers killed dozens of Palestinian protesters along the Gaza border.On Monday, the US officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as a new US Embassy opened there. It’s a controversial move that breaks with decades of official US policy — and it comes at a particularly tumultuous time for Israel and the region.President Donald Trump announced his decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem back in December, calling it “a long-overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement.”On May 14, which coincided with the 70th anniversary of Israel’s founding, Trump’s daughter Ivanka, her husband Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and a number of members of Congress attended the opening ceremony in the former consulate building in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Arnona. The new embassy will be housed there temporarily, as the administration scouts out a permanent location. Christian and Jewish religious leaders were reportedly in attendance as well — the guest list included close to 800 people. Trump himself spoke by video link from Washington.But as the embassy event got underway on Monday, Israeli soldiers were firing on Palestinian protesters at the Gaza border. As of Tuesday morning, they had killed at least 60 people and wounded thousands of others. Many of the protesters were unarmed, though some hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails. The Israeli military also said that they shot three protesters who were attempting to detonate a bomb. No Israelis so far have been injured.Palestinians are in their seventh week of protests at the border with Gaza, calling for the right of return to territory that is now part of Israel. They’re also protesting the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which is suffering from a stifling Israeli and Egyptian blockade. The embassy opening also comes right before what Palestinians call Nakba Day, or the Day of Catastrophe, where Palestinians commemorate lands they either fled or were evicted from after the creation of the state of Israel. Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, also begins this week.Meanwhile, Israel and Iran’s shadow war in Syria is moving closer to becoming an actual, full-blown conflict. On May 9, Iran reportedly launched 20 missiles into the Golan Heights, and Israel responded with strikes on Iranian-linked targets in Syria. Last week, Trump announced that the US was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, a move that could push Iran closer to acquiring a nuclear weapon.Put together, the embassy move is happening at a chaotic, unpredictable, and dangerous time for both the region and Israel itself. And though the White House says that moving the US embassy to Jerusalem will increase stability and the chance of peace, there’s a real reason to worry that it will do the opposite. When the president announced the decision to move the embassy back in December, it placed him squarely in the middle of the decades-long conflict over Jerusalem.As Sarah Wildman and Jennifer Williams wrote for Vox in December, both the Palestinians and the Israelis claim Jerusalem as their capital, and the city contains sites sacred to both Jews and Muslims. Though Israel’s parliament and the prime minister’s home are in Jerusalem, they sit in West Jerusalem, on the side of the city Israel has controlled since 1949. Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed that half of the city.The international community considers East Jerusalem occupied territory. But that half of the city also contains sites holy to all three major monotheistic religions, including the Western Wall, the holiest place in the world where Jews can openly pray, and Haram al-Sharif, Arabic for “the Noble Sanctuary,” a sacred site for Muslims that Israelis refer to as the Temple Mount.The Palestinians want to officially divide the city and make East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state. The Israelis disagree — and the right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long made clear that it wouldn’t consider making concessions over Jerusalem, in part because Jews were barred from the Western Wall when the Old City was under Jordanian control in the years before the 1967 war.All of this helps explain why the Israeli government was pleased when Trump made good on a promise he’d made time and time again during his campaign and recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.To be clear, Trump isn’t the first US president to talk about moving the American embassy to Jerusalem. As Politico points out, Bill Clinton said he supported the idea in principle. George W. Bush declared he would move the US ambassador there in 2000. And Barack Obama, for his part, referred to the city as the capital of Israel and said it must remain “undivided.” Congress has also repeatedly passed legislation calling for the embassy move.But none of the previous presidents followed through — one reason being that the move would appear to put the US squarely on the side of Israel.Ilan Goldenberg, a Middle East expert with the Center for New American Security, told me that Trump’s decision significantly undercuts the US’s credibility as a neutral party in the conflict.As the country that has led the Israeli-Palestinian peace process negotiations for the past 25 years, the US is “supposed to be acting like the fireman,” he said. “Instead, we’re acting like the arsonist — we’re making things worse.” The embassy move could also make the chances of a peace deal, already remote given that the two sides haven’t held serious peace talks in years, nearly impossible.“Jerusalem is the linchpin to an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement,”  Khaled Elgindy, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, told me. Trump’s recognition of the city as Israel’s capital is a “huge victory” for the Israelis, he added, but it also “essentially takes a Palestinian state off the table.”Much of the world was shocked when Trump announced the upcoming embassy move, and world leaders feared there would be an outbreak of violence. Palestinians held a general strike, and four protesters died during clashes with Israeli soldiers. Thousands protested in Turkey, Lebanon, Morocco, and elsewhere. But the protests were short-lived and mostly peaceful. The massive violent reaction people feared never came. Indeed, neighboring Arab countries’ reactions in recent months have been fairly muted. Many are dealing with their own domestic issues, such as economic issues, political unrest in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, and two ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen.“The people in the region have been through a great deal of hardship over the past few years owing to war, conflict, and authoritarianism,” H.A. Hellyer, an expert on the politics of the Arab world, told me. “I don’t think they have the bandwidth to respond to this latest political outrage.”There’s also the fact that several Arab countries have quietly begun to grow closer to Israel. For two years, Egypt secretly allowed Israel to carry out drone strikes against militant groups on the restive Sinai peninsula. Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince informally known as MBS, reportedly disparaged the Palestinian leadership while visiting the US in March, saying, “It’s about time the Palestinians take the proposals and agree to come to the negotiations table or shut up and stop complaining.” In an Atlantic interview, he also said that Israel had the right to “their own land.” And just last week, after Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal and Iran reportedly fired missiles into Israel, Bahrain’s foreign minister tweeted that Israel has the right to defend itself in the face of Iranian aggression — a sign that Arab fears about the growing threat posed by Iran may trump former regional disagreements.Despite these signs, though, it would be wrong to assume that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has fallen off the radar for Arab leaders. Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud put the issue of Palestine at the top of the Arab League conference’s agenda last month, declared that it would be called the “Jerusalem summit,” and issued a strong statement condemning Washington’s planned embassy move. And MBS himself said that there would be no normalization with Israel until the “Palestinian issue was resolved.” These conflicting signals mean it’s impossible to know whether the actual embassy move will spark widespread violence in neighboring countries — or pass by relatively quietly.According to the State Department, the new embassy is opening in the building that houses current consular operations in southern Jerusalem. There are plans to relocate it to a separate annex, and a permanent location, by the end of 2019.The Trump administration says that it’s not taking a stance on final status issues like the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem. And during a White House call on Friday, US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said the move was done to create “a better dynamic for peace,” and that “from a broader perspective, this helps stability.”  But Friedman also said that no members of the US delegation coming to celebrate the embassy move had plans to meet with any Palestinian officials.And experts say this move essentially shuts down any potential talks with Palestinians. “If you don’t have Palestinian involvement, you don’t have a peace process. It’s as simple as that,” Elgindy told me. “I don’t see how a Palestinian leader can engage with this administration on the peace process after Monday.”It seems much more likely, Elgindy continued, that another country will have to step in and take on the primary role of overseeing peace negotiations. But it’s unclear which country that would be or how long it would take.With the US effectively discredited by this move, “we have a vacuum that’s not likely to be filled anytime soon. Anything that would emerge would have to be an entirely new framework for peace,” he told me. “We’re just in limbo.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Full Q&A: Y Combinator’s Sam Altman and Recode’s Kara Swisher discuss tech ethics, addiction and Facebook",2018-12-10,Vox,['Eric Johnson'],"Filed under:Should Mark Zuckerberg fire himself? And other tough questions.If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.On a recent episode of Recode Decode, Y Combinator president Sam Altman joined Recode’s Kara Swisher at the San Francisco bar Manny’s for a live discussion about the state of tech. Their conversation, moderated by the bar’s owner Manny Yekutiel, touched on the diversity of Silicon Valley’s employees, the future of artificial intelligence, whether Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should fire himself and much more.You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Manny and Sam.Manny Yekutiel: Tonight’s conversation is Technology and Politics: How the Fuck Did We Get Here? But I left the F-word out of the EventBrite title.Kara Swisher: Okay, all right.Manny Yekutiel: So how it’s gonna go is we’re gonna talk for about 45 minutes. We’re just gonna kibbitz here; that’s Yiddish for just kinda like ...I know what that is, thank you. I grew up in Roslyn Harbor, Long Island. I’m good.Manny Yekutiel: Okay, good. I want to hear the Long Island accent come up.I’m a shaineh madela.Manny Yekutiel: Oh, you are a shaineh madela.See, there you go. Anyway, move along.Manny Yekutiel: Sam’s jealous.Move along!Manny Yekutiel: Okay, so then 45 minutes of us kibbitzing and then 45 minutes of you guys. I have an Oprah mic down here that I’m gonna hand to you guys for Q&A. So we’re just gonna chat for 45, you guys for 45, and then you guys can keep drinking, all right? So let’s begin.Cool.Manny Yekutiel: So we’re gonna kinda move chronologically a little bit here, and I want you guys ... For those in the audience that haven’t been to conversations with you already and haven’t met you, talk a little bit about the utopia that the early technologists were thinking about when they thought about how technology and the World Wide Web would interact with politics. What did people think was gonna happen with the intersection of tech and politics?I mean, I can start. I think they didn’t think at all; I think you think that they thought and they know what they were doing, and I think a lot of things get written after people become billionaires or after they become successful. But having been there at the very beginning ... I actually lived in Washington, I worked for the Washington Post when the internet was actually born. Not when it was born, because it was there before as a government entity, but when it was commercialized for the first time; was when they released it and there was legislation, which I covered, and actually Al Gore ... That’s how I met Al Gore because he was a principal senator behind it; he did, in fact, invent the internet, and he was integral to that.And so you imagine that people had great thoughtfulness towards what was gonna happen or the implications, and they absolutely did not. And I think that’s a lie that is now being borne out today, is that you think that Mark Zuckerberg, for example, to name someone who’s plunging toward disaster right now, had an idea of what was gonna happen. I don’t think they had any idea whatsoever, and in fact designed these systems in a way that if you had an idea of what was gonna happen or any kind of anticipation, you might’ve made other choices in the way they were built.Sam Altman: I don’t think people knew what was gonna happen because it’s sort of ... It’s unimaginable what has happened. Fourteen years ago, Facebook was a website that no one took seriously in Mark Zuckerberg’s dorm room. You know, 14 years ago, the first prototype of the iPhone, I don’t think, had been made. The speed and the size and the impact that has happened, I think that we’ve just lived through one of the three great technological revolutions in human history, and the rate of change of technology is so much faster than the rate of change of people; certainly of evolution, but even how quickly we can update our own thought processes.I think I agree that people didn’t think about what was gonna happen, but it was not out of any malice; it was just like it’s hard to have ... I remember what it was like at the beginning of that. It’s hard to imagine that it got this big, that it went this well.Well, so you’re saying they didn’t have malice. I mean, that’s a pretty low bar; it’s like they weren’t assholes. That shouldn’t be the bar. It’s just that thoughtlessness can just have the same amount of damage.Sam Altman: Oh, for sure.... that lack of ... And my issue with a lot of is, as it began to develop, they pretended that they didn’t have the power and money they were collecting. And so the thoughtlessness continued, and continues today, with the people who run ...Sam Altman: So I certainly think what has gone wrong is when it became clear this was going to be as big as it has become, people didn’t stop and say, “Okay, what do we do now?” But at the beginning, when people were just sort of imagining what the internet was gonna be like and what mobile was gonna do, I don’t think anyone could have really predicted this. That would be very hard.Manny Yekutiel: But wasn’t ... I remember when I first moved here, I went to Noisebridge and there were all these kind of anarco-hackers that were talking about how, you know, afterwards we’re not gonna have governments, we’re not gonna ... That tech is gonna kinda free everyone and break our chains. And wasn’t there this kind of undercurrent of folks who thought of technology as a way to break down the systems of power?Well, unusual because it was all white men, who are really the most under-siege people on the planet. So no. I’m gonna say no for that one. I do think that ...Manny Yekutiel: That’s a hard no from Kara Swisher.It’s a hard no. You know, it’s interesting when I think back because I came here in 19 ... I’d written a book about AOL, which was the first commercialized, really ...Manny Yekutiel: I remember chat rooms.Chat rooms and things like that. And I came here because I was hired to the Wall Street Journal to cover the ... It wasn’t even called the internet; it was online services. And I was the first reporter to cover the internet for them. And when I got ... I’ve told this story before. When I got the job, a lot of the media reporters said, “Oh, you’re here to cover CB radio,” and I was like, “No, I’m here to cover the medium that’s gonna decimate all your industries. Nice to meet you.” And they were like ...Manny Yekutiel: So you haven’t changed one bit.No, not a bit. No. But it was really interesting because you got a sort of front row seat to ... I mean, I remember going ... By the way, Google didn’t even exist for a long ... Oh my goodness. Didn’t even exist for a long time from when I was here, but it was Marc Andreessen when he was ... he might’ve been a teenager when I met him; I think he was 19 or something. You know, early at Yahoo when they were five or six people. Bezos I met when he had five people. Like it was really early. Early, early, early on.Manny Yekutiel: Okay, so let’s take a giant leap forward to closer to today, and part of the reason why I wanted to do this conversation with you guys as it relates to civic engagement is I think we’re living in a time where people have a lot of anger, tension, anxiety around the intersection with how technology has affected our politics, specifically after this 2016 election. So one of the first questions I wanted to ask is do you think people would be feeling this way if Hillary Clinton had won?Sam Altman: I mean, yes, but they’d be different people. Fifty percent of the country would be feeling this way, but a different 50 percent.Manny Yekutiel: Even with the whole like, you know, if Russia had tried to ... Because part of it was this feeling that the Russians co-opted our technology in order to make it so that Donald Trump would win, right? So there’s this feeling of this tool that was supposed to help us fucking everything up. And do you ... If Donald Trump had won even given that ... Sorry, if Hillary Clinton had won given that, do you really think that there’d be this much angst and anxiety?Sam Altman: I personally do. I mean, I think there are other people on the other side who would say, well, there were these other powerful things that were trying to help Hillary win. I think the story would get told either way, and I think there were probably a lot of people on both sides trying to use the platforms to influence.You know, I remember it was only two election cycles ago when candidates were saying, “Well, do I have to think about digital at all? Like, I just do it by TV ads, right?” So the speed with which technology has changed politics and the degree to which I think most candidates still don’t understand that is huge, and I think that a lot of people wish that hadn’t happened or that change hadn’t happened so quickly in politics. But I always believe people when they say they’re angry. I think that is always true, but it’s very hard to articulate the precise reason you’re angry, and I think you see a lot of that in the way people talk about technology in the 2016 election. Something clearly has changed in what I would say is a bad way, at least it’s a very different way, but it’s hard to precisely articulate what that is and what we want to do about it.There’s two parts. First of all, look, Donald Trump is very good at the internet, and Brad Parscale, even though he’s a loathsome creature, is also ...Manny Yekutiel: Who’s that?He’s the campaign manager for Trump and he was the digital director, and he’s the one that really did understand how to use and target people in really ... Some nefarious ways, some very effective ways, appeal to fear and anger. Target people online and use these services the way that you would sell cookies or a movie or something like that. Really did understand it. And I think the Clinton campaign was still operating in an old style, a digital style, and so was the Democratic Party. And one of the things that’s always been really striking because the original people, if you ... A couple cycles ago it was Howard Dean and Joe what’s-his-name. Oh, that guy, Trippy, right. We had him at one of our AllThingsD [conferences] one year. He had done some of the early digital stuff for Howard Dean, which was effective initially, but the problem was not everybody had a cellphone, not everybody was online, and things like that. And one of the people we actually interviewed way back then was Ralph Reid. Because one of the things that’s interesting if you think about it is, for much of the 20th century, most of the media outlets were liberal; were liberal or left-center, center-left, centrist, but certainly not conservative. And even though they say we’re fair, they just weren’t. They were liberal, essentially. And the right-wing did not have a place to talk until online, and so they got very good at it very early because they were the out-of-power people. And so they moved to cable, like with Fox News, and it’s hard to think of now, but cable was an outlying medium back then. And the same thing with the internet; they used the internet really well and they learned how to use and communicate on it really well, and then they learned how to use it in a more nefarious way.Manny Yekutiel: Do you think we’ve moved too fast? I mean Sam, you’ve said twice here that no one could’ve imagined how much it would change in 15 years. Do you feel like we developed too quickly and society’s just not catching up and we should’ve gone slower? Is that even possible?Sam Altman: Well, what I was gonna say is I would love it if that were possible. But in like the world we have, the fastest-moving company tends to win; the company that gets to the most scale the fastest and proves the fastest, makes the best products, tends to win, and that’s mostly good. But it has some important negative consequences, and I think we’re all now wrestling with what to do about that.But I think it’s very hard to stop progress; that probably won’t work. And I think what we can do, and what I think we need to figure out how to do now, is how do we as a society adapt more quickly when the world can change so fast? I think it’s better to try to get faster at society correcting than trying to slow down technological progress, and we so far have been very bad at that.Manny Yekutiel: So we’re ...It’s interesting because the way you’re talking about it is if we don’t have control over it, right? That these people have done it, we have done this. We haven’t done this. Certain people have done this, and they run these companies.And so what’s really interesting about Silicon Valley that I’ve covered is when there’s successes, we sort of celebrate a lot of these people like they’re geniuses. I always say ... They always tell me ... They spend all day telling me how smart they are, like continually. Not you, Sam. You’re lovely.Sam Altman: Thank you.Again, low bar. But they ...Sam Altman: I’ll still take it.Good. Take it, take it. Run, run, run right out the door.Manny Yekutiel: She pays you a compliment, you take that compliment.You run right down Valencia; you keep going till you get to Palo Alto.So they spend a lot of time telling you how smart they are, and then when things go wrong, they move into the “we.” Like if you’ve noticed that with Zuckerberg ... Have you noticed that? Like “Well, I want to ... The community wants to work together to fix this problem.” And I was in an interview with him; I go, “Well, you own the community,” and he’s like, “Yes, but I think the community should all decide.” And I go, “But you have 60 percent of the company and you control it. You’re the CEO, the chairman and the founder, and you have unprecedented power over this giant organization of which you have no ability to run.” And yet the people should work together. And I was like, “Well when do the people get power?” It just goes ... It’s hysterical to watch.Sam Altman: I have a question for you: Do you think Mark Zuckerberg should be the one who decides who gets to use Facebook and who doesn’t, and who gets to say stuff and who doesn’t, and what you can say and what you can’t?Yes. I think he built the company, and yes, he should. This is his product.Sam Altman: And does that future not ...He’s not a government. He’s not a government, and this is the lie that Silicon Valley tells you. This is a for-profit company of which Mark Zuckerberg is now a $64 billionaire. Sam Altman: For sure, but ...So he took the money.Sam Altman: ... in some sense he’s bigger than a government, and we ...Yes, of course he is, and that’s what’s terrifying.Sam Altman: And yet he’s unfireable.He’s unfireable. That’s what I said. Unkillable, unfireable. I think I called him a mix between ... In the Times column last week, I called him a mix between ... If you mix Wolverine and Deadpool together and added in, you know, a zombie or two. Sam Altman: I think all ... I don’t agree with that, just to say it clearly.Manny Yekutiel: I’m just gonna let this ...Wait, hold this for a second. I’m a little warm right now. I’ve gotta change brands, hold up.Manny Yekutiel: We’ve got a moment. I’m gonna wait for this. I feel like ... I don’t know what’s happening here.I gotta be careful you don’t get a boob shot. You got it?Manny Yekutiel: Yeah, I got it.Okay, all right.Manny Yekutiel: All right. Some people call it changing hats, you call it changing T-shirts.Changing brands.Sam Altman: So look, I certainly would like to see different rules for what you’re allowed to say and not say on the internet, but it scares me to think that a small handful of people that are not accountable to us and not elected by us and can do whatever they want get to make the decisions about who gets to exist online and who doesn’t. So I would welcome regulations for who gets a megaphone, who gets a platform, what you’re allowed to say and not say. But it’s surprising to me to hear people that are traditionally very far on the left in the technology industry saying, “We want the companies to make these rules,” not, “We want a government that we get to elect to make these rules.”Look, the broadcast networks have been doing it forever, so I don’t know ... Would you have a problem when the New York Times did it? It was like 12 white guys on the Upper West Side of New York would decide what was on the front page of the New York Times every day for decades.Sam Altman: Actually I think that was bad too.Yes, exactly. I’m saying the broadcast networks were the same; this is not different. What’s different is the size, and the unprecedented size and influence and impact, and the amplification of the situation. But it’s not un-similar to the person who ran CBS and NBC and ABC when there were only three networks.Sam Altman: To be clear, I feel equally bad about three people deciding ... Like I don’t think that was a good world either when we had, you know, the three heads of those networks deciding what people got to hear. I think that’s ...That’s always been the world, and I think what’s ...Sam Altman: But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t shoot for something better.Right. The only ... Except what? Because this is what always coalesces, is power in the hands of a certain small group of people who are typically the same people, and then the discussion turns to, say, right now for example, the discussions around tribalism, like how there’s so much tribalism. The issue isn’t tribalism, the issue is the system sucks for most people.And so what ... Let me just finish. What happens is, for example on these platforms, is the people building them have never felt unsafe in their life for one second. And so what happens is ... Like I was with someone from Twitter and they had suddenly gotten attacked online for something; they’d suddenly gotten strafed, like the ... And they said, “This is really hard,” and I go, “Welcome to the rest of the world for women, people of color, gays and the rest of us.” They get this all the time, and it depends on what group it is.And so what happens is the ... The problem is the diversity at the top is lacking. If there was a more diverse top, you would get a very different outcome here.Sam Altman: So I think that ... I’m all for the different outcome and I’m all for sort of way more investment to fix the problem of harassment and discrimination online. I think that’s become a huge problem. For all that tech has done wrong, I do think one thing that’s really great is that those people who have been denied a voice, who have not been the three white guys in charge of the network, finally have a voice and we’re seeing huge social change come from that. And honestly, for all of the hugely negative things that have gone wrong and for all of the ways we haven’t yet figured out how to adapt to this, which are huge, the fact that everyone in the world now has access to a platform and a voice. We’ve seen incredibly positive change in a short period of time.Manny Yekutiel: Right. Think about Black Lives Matter, think about the Dakota pipeline, think about police brutality.Sam Altman: So that’s great.But they don’t have a voice because they don’t own it just because the ... See, this is the lie ...Sam Altman: But it’s catalyzing action.It sort of is, but it’s owned by the same people. I mean, we just did a piece on Recode where we just ... A couple years ago, I did a piece called “The Men and No Women of Facebook,” and I just put up their pictures. And it was like white guy, white guy, white guy, Asian guy, Indian guy, white guy. Like that was the whole thing. And at the time, either Mark or someone called and said, “That’s really unfair,” and I said, “You hired them. I didn’t. I’m just putting up their pictures for people to see.”But recently, we did another one when they did a reorg of Facebook ... I don’t mean to pick on Facebook particularly because every tech company’s like this. We put all the pictures and I think we said there’s more people named Jim here than there are women. Like it was something like that, and then we like ... And as for people of color, well, Kevin Systrom’s picture is in black and white. That’s the only difference. Like it was ridiculous; it was insanity that they have ... If you look at these management structures, the real ... Black Lives Matters can talk, but they don’t run Facebook. These different groups can do things, but they don’t own Google. Sam Altman: So hypothetical then: If tonight something changed and the people that ran these companies represented the actual public that are speaking out and being given a voice, what do you think would change in our politics?It would be a much better internet, I can tell you that. I think it would be a quantumly better internet if there’s more voices at the table. How to change politics?Sam Altman: I’m not arguing against the need for greater diversity in leadership. It seems to me that the echo chamber that civic discourse online is dirty, it’s difficult, it’s ad hominem, it’s not particularly productive, and my question is how does a more diverse top raise the level of discourse?Because politics is about power. I don’t know if you ... I mean, that’s what I think it’s about; politics is about power, and who has it and who doesn’t have it, and who’s allowed to wield it and do things. And these jobs have very real-world implications, and so the people that are in power ... Oh, who’s yelling? That’s nice. The people that are in power matter and the people that are empowered matter, and that includes the ownership of these companies and also who’s running them. I think better ... I mean, look at Y Combinator; you’re making enormous efforts to try to diversify the pool, correct?Sam Altman: Certainly, and diversifying our partnership has absolutely reflected in a more diverse set of founders. So I believe this works, I really do. I do think it’s somewhat separate from ... It’s not the only way to make these platforms work better. I mean, government regulation about how we handle discourse, and online harassment, and what you’re allowed to say and not say, I think is another way to do it. And I personally will always be more comfortable with that than a small group of people, no matter what they look like, that are in absolute power forever and unfireable making these decisions.Manny Yekutiel: So let’s talk about power for a second. Another reason why I wanted to bring the two of you together is we’re all friends and both of you independently came to me and said, you know, “I’m thinking about running for political office,” separate from each other. I think you were ... Can I say? You were considering maybe running for ... Lightly, okay. We talked about it, about running for governor of California, and you and I talked about running for mayor of San Francisco. And I was like, “Awesome, let’s ... How can I help or what would you like to talk about?” So tell me a little bit about why you were thinking about running for office and why you chose not to.Sam Altman: I was thinking about it because I think the state is in a very bad place, particularly when it comes to the cost of living and specifically the cost of housing. And if that doesn’t get fixed, I think the state is going to devolve into a very unpleasant place. Like one thing that I have really come to believe is that you cannot have social justice without economic justice, and economic justice in California feels unattainable. And I think it would take someone with no loyalties to sort of very powerful interest groups. I would not be indebted to other groups, and so maybe I could try a couple of variable things, just on this issue.So you’re like Bloomberg without an obsession with Coca-Cola, right?Sam Altman: I don’t know he has an obsession with Coca-Cola.Hello, Big Gulp?Sam Altman: The reason I didn’t, or the reasons I didn’t ...Manny Yekutiel: This talk brought to you by Coca-Cola.Sam Altman: I don’t think I’d have enough experience to do it, because maybe I could do like a few things that would be really good, but I wouldn’t know how to deal with the thousands of things that also just needed to happen. And more importantly than that to me personally, I wanted to spend my time trying to make sure we get artificial intelligence built in a really good way, which I think is like, to me personally, the most important problem in the world and not something I was willing to set aside to run for office.Manny Yekutiel: What about you, Kara?I just wanted unmitigated power to screw people.Sam Altman: I love the honesty.Yeah, it’s true. I’d have like limousines idling in front of my house, things like that. And then I would want to get like thrown out of office in a really dramatic fashion; “Fuck you, I’ll get you back!” That’s what I wanted. That’s why.Manny Yekutiel: So why didn’t you do it?I don’t know, it’s just next. You know, it’s like in Valley of the Dolls, I’d be like Neely O’Hara; like “All of you fuckers.”So no, I wanted ... Because I was complaining too much and I thought, “This is ridiculous. I shouldn’t complain, I should do something.” It was very simple. And you know, after the Trump election, I thought if this idiot can get elected, I could get elected. Really, like it was things ... The brakes were off for people; something had changed with him. If I can pay him a small compliment, that’s the smallest I’ll give him, is that the brakes were off for people that could ... The way politics ... He’s unhinged everything, which is not necessarily a bad thing. He happens to be a bad thing, but that ...Sam Altman: But that’s a good thing, I think.Yes, I do too. I do too. Manny Yekutiel: Yeah, we saw in this recent election all these people that never would’ve run beforehand. You know, I built this space; because of it, there’s millions of people that are changing the way they think about their interaction with the body politic because of that election.Yeah. So I thought that that was ... I think it was a similar thing. And now, of course, now that fantastic squad of ladies that’s run by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ... She’s the head of it, it looks like, and they’ve got a squad of them. I want to join that squad now, so I have to run for Congress. Like I figured they’ll let the old white lady in; like, “Let her in. Let’s have her for humor.”But I thought about that. I thought about, you know, that this is a city, I’ve lived here for 20 ... A long time, and that it was important to instead of just complain about things, to do something about it. Now we have a new mayor, so no one thought that the former mayor would die like that, and they’ve got ... You should give this mayor a chance. I think it’s really important not just to be difficult to run.Manny Yekutiel: So we’re gonna ask like one or two more questions and then we’re gonna open up to open Q&A.We’re gonna take a quick break now. We’ll be back to this live interview with Y Combinator President Sam Altman after this.[ad]Manny Yekutiel: Okay, here’s what’s gonna happen: I’m gonna ask you guys each individual questions and then I’m gonna ask kind of a final question. So your first op-ed in the New York Times was entitled “Mark Zuckerberg and the Expensive ...”“The Expensive Education of Mark Zuckerberg.”Manny Yekutiel: And Silicon Valley.And I meant for the rest of us, not for him.Manny Yekutiel: Has he learned?No. I wouldn’t say so.Manny Yekutiel: Will he?Oh, he’s a nice man, you know what I mean? Like he’s a very ... As Sam knows, he’s a nice guy; he’s really a ... And it’s the same thing, he’s personally nice, but he’s causing enormous damage.I think one of the things, if you listen to that podcast ... Everyone focused on the Holocaust deniers part where he said essentially they don’t mean to lie, and I was like they do mean to lie; they mean to lie a lot. And so that was, to me, an insane thing to say, but that got a lot of the attention. That essentially was Mark Zuckerberg should never get on a stage with me ever again in his life, because last time he almost sweated to death and then this time he defended Holocaust deniers. That was nice.Manny Yekutiel: Yeah, two out of two right there.I know. How do I get him to say things like that?Anyway, so the exchange I was most disturbed by, and I’ve written about it since in the Times, was when I kept pressing him on the impact of his inventions on Myanmar and India; that they had made these pretty sloppy rules in these countries and these products were not thought out properly, and they weren’t introduced properly, and they didn’t have the proper people in place to manage it, and it created ... People died, and that how did he feel about that? And so, “How did you feel about that, that you made this badly and there was real-life consequences?” And instead of ... What he said was, he goes, “What I’m really interested in is solutions. Solutions are what I like to do. Like I think we should just get in and fix the situation” — “we” again. “We should fix the situation.” And I was like, “Yeah, I got that, but you caused the problem, so how do you feel about what you caused?” And so six times I asked him the same question, six times. And I said, “Yeah, but I want to know how you think about it.”Sam Altman: But don’t you think that ... I mean, if I was in his shoes and I had billions of people all like ... I’ve had all these things weighing on my shoulders. How could he start to let that affect his emotional strength? Because he wouldn’t be able to make it through the day otherwise.Because he took the money and the job. I’m sorry. He’s an adult. I don’t mean to be rude, but like, stop treating him like he’s a juvenile and like oh my goodness, this poor hoodie-cladden boy; it’s so hard for him. Like, my kids can take more pressure than he can.But nonetheless, he kept ... I asked him six times, it went on for a while because it got really uncomfortable, and he kept saying, “We’ve gotta fix the solution.” I said, “Yeah, but you caused the problem. How do you feel about it? How do you feel about it? How do you feel about it? People died.” And he finally got exasperated because I’d done it so many times, and I did that on purpose, and he goes, “What do you want me to say?” I said, “How about starting off with, ‘I’m really sorry what I did caused people to die.’” That would be like the human reaction, right? That’s the first answer. And then secondly, I’d wonder if I was capable of handling this thing and if I’m the right person to do this, because it does have real-world implications.And then I asked who should be fired for this, who should be fired? And you know, he hummed and hawed, and he goes, “I guess me because I’m the CEO and the founder, and I own and control it, and I’m the chairman.” And he goes, “Well, do you want me to fire myself?” and I said, “That would be fine.” You know what I mean? Like I’m just saying, I just want them to understand the implications.Sam Altman: But would that actually solve the problem? If Mark Zuckerberg went to Hawaii and was like, “Okay, bye guys. I’m done.” Like we still have billions of people ... Like here’s the thing, he posted on Facebook and I’ve looked recently on his posts. It doesn’t matter what he posts about, you then have tens of thousands of people attacking each other about Brett Kavanaugh, Palestine, sexual assault, whatever. And it’s just like this whirlpool of hate, that sure, he’s the one that starts the whirlpool, but if he was replaced by someone else, wouldn’t people still be ...I don’t know. I don’t know. I think he needs help. I think they need big-time help there with a lot of people who have more global viewpoints, that maybe are not living in the bubble of Palo Alto, that have a bigger idea of things, that understand ethical issues, that ... These are ethical, societal, philosophical issues, and these are people, if you know them, are lovely people, but ill-equipped to deal with them, I think.Sam Altman: I want to say something. Before I do it, I want to make two points for clarity. One is I think it’s a real shame that he didn’t start that with “I’m sorry,” which seems the obvious human reaction and what anyone would want from a leader in that situation. I have the feeling he felt it and I think there’s sometimes such an adversarial relationship between people under siege and people asking them questions that maybe you don’t feel like you can express it, but I wish he had done that and I want to believe that’s what he felt.The second thing is I wanna be clear that I do think we need to adapt these platforms and their rules and how we use them much faster. It turns out when you give everyone a voice, you get great and terrible behavior from that and it’s easy in stories to always categorize people and we as humans like the stories where people are either clearly the hero or clearly the villain. And unfortunately it’s almost never the case. There’s good and evil in everybody and everything, but I do think we need to get addressed, as you said people are dying and we need to address that much faster and with more seriousness than we have been. And I believe we can, although I believe that’s going to take work that we’re not currently doing. But I think it’s easy to talk about how people are dying. And I think it’s important to talk about how people are living too.I grew up gay in the Midwest in the ’90s and early 2000s. And that was sort of not very good, and I think without the internet I will honestly say I’m not sure I would have made it through that. That was ... transformed me personally, I think it’s been transformative, the acceptance of gay people in the world. And I think you can say that for many other groups that have been oppressed with no voice for a long time. I have no doubt that many people have lived because of Facebook as well.I get that argument. But it’s how they’re building the structure. Nicole Wong who used to work for Twitter and Google, fantastic, smart person. She was a lawyer for them. We did an amazing interview where she talked about the pillars you build these things on. And originally, for example, the pillar for Google was context, authenticity, authentic and something else. You pick the choices you make to build the structure you’re making. What Facebook has been built on, for example, I’m just using Facebook because it’s the biggest, and Twitter is its own cesspool of mess, but actually is kind of fun in a lot of ways. Today was really fun for some reason, there was all kinds of weird names on there. But, you build it on certain things, so what Facebook has been built on is virality, speed and engagement. When you build it on those premises, guess what you get? Precisely what you get. You get fake news, you get hatred. If you build it around community, context, authentic connections, that’s a very different business. But guess what? It’s not as lucrative a business.Sam Altman: Look, it deeply troubles me, and I think it should deeply trouble everyone that these companies have teams of people that figure out how to exploit our dopamine systems. And you get what you get. You get what you expect to get out of that. I do think, though, that there is more good than bad that comes from this. If I could push a button and make all the Facebook products disappear, I wouldn’t. Twitter maybe. Facebook, I’m joking about that. I do think that the value that we’ve gotten, and again we need to adapt. It’s happened much faster than I think human society has been able to adapt, or so far we’ve been able to adapt to. But I think there’s incredible good that’s easy to get lost in the discussion.Manny Yekutiel: So based on your comments, you guys are both leaders, you’re thinking of the future. You’re talking to the people who are at the core of this. Based on those conversations, and you’re reading the tea leaves, where do you see this going? Are we on the edge of a precipice and it’s just going to get worse? Or are people really waking up to some of the issues with these tools and are taking really serious concrete steps to solving them?I wish I could say that, but a lot of the stuff that’s out of Facebook right now is we’re the victims here. I’ve never seen, it’s insane that reaction. It’s fascinating. It’s really interesting contrast to the Google people around the sexual harassment. The employees actually said wait a second, this is not how we want to run a company. Which was interesting. The Facebook employees are more, I call them docile. But they are. They’re docile. They must feed them Soma in the bread or something like that. In the artisanal ...Manny Yekutiel: What is that?It’s from a book called “1984.”Sam Altman: “Brave New World,” isn’t it?Manny Yekutiel: Kara, we’re on television right now.But it’s a book.Manny Yekutiel: National television.But it’s a book you should have read.Manny Yekutiel: I went to yeshiva, we weren’t allowed to read that.I should run Facebook because I’ve read “1984” and I understand the implications of dictatorship.Sam Altman: It’s from “1984” or “Brave New World”?Manny Yekutiel: That’s what this is all about you just want to ...Audience member: “Brave New World.”Sam Altman: Yeah, close enough.Manny Yekutiel: Wait a second.I’m sorry, “Brave New World,” not “1984,” George Orwell. Oh my God. No wait, you’re right. We read them, it was ninth grade, we read ‘em all, we read ‘em all. But in any case, I’m sorry. They ... what was your point?Manny Yekutiel: I don’t know. I’m embarrassed now.If there’s anything to happen. Is there anything gonna, in the future.Manny Yekutiel: I will say ...I think Congress is going to insert itself, and the fact that Lindsey Graham is going to have any say over this is disturbing. I think it’s bad. These people in Congress, I’ve spent a lot of time in Washington, been visiting them. There are a few senators, Senator Warner, Senator Klobuchar, most of the senators, Senator Burr, Senator Bennet. There’s a couple that are pretty intelligent. Senator Wyden. Who else? You know them better than I do. Congressman anybody.Sam Altman: I just maybe less that I think highly of than you. Some good ones.Right, I know, but I’m just saying.Sam Altman: Look, I think we’re going to get this resolved, but I don’t ... but I think we’ve actually lost sight of what’s really important. I think we are living on an exponential curve of technology, and the rate of changes has been increasing every year, every decade, it’s going to keep changing. And what we are in right now, which feels like the most important and most difficult technological issue we will ever face, will turn out to be nothing but a warm-up drill for the stuff that we’re going to be dealing with in the next, five, then next 10, years. And so I think this, that seems like this absolute meltdown, there can be nothing more important, nothing harder, we are going to look back at this with fondness in the way that we look back at previous presidents now and be like whenever when life was so simple. But the next round of issues are going to be like, what does it mean when anyone can edit anyone else’s genome? What does it mean when we have artificial intelligence that is smarter than humans in every way? These, I promise, these are going to make the issues of today look like trifles that we wish we had to deal with again.I think he’s right. It’s AI, robotics, changes in transportation, gene, things around genes and DNA. These are, it’s about to come, is really frightening in terms of who determines these things and the impact it has on society, for sure. Sam Altman: The thing that’s always hard about exponential curves is when you look backwards they look flat and when you look forwards they look vertical. And you kind of only sense your own relative pace of progress so it always feels like the most important thing ever, and in that sense it’s always true. But if you don’t look forward, if we get totally mired down in this stuff that’s happening right now and we miss these questions, they really get to fundamental questions about what is the future of humanity going to look like? What does it mean to be human? What is the world going to look like in 30 years, which is unrecognizably different, and that part I’m confident about. I’m confident we’ll adjust the current issues, I’m not at all confident we’ll be able to address the future ones.And then sensors and surveillance too. What does a Chinese-driven internet look like, and those kinds of things. It’s a really interesting question.Manny Yekutiel: Lordy, lordy, lord. Goodness.Lordy, lordy, lord. It’s hard to think about because he’s right. The surveillance stuff that’s coming. The sensors, the stuff you put in our bodies and things like that ... the altering of your own bodies, it’s really big stuff.Manny Yekutiel: You’re speaking to a packed house here in San Francisco and also the American public on CSPAN and you have OpenAI and you’re both very involved in these questions. Is there anything we can do right now, other than just sit and wait for this technology to be developed and then hope it doesn’t destroy us? What can we actually do?Not watch “Black Mirror.”Sam Altman: Actually, I think sci-fi is really important to watch.Not the pig one. I’ll never unsee that one.Manny Yekutiel: I didn’t see the pig one.Oh, don’t see the pig one.Manny Yekutiel: Okay.Don’t see the pig one.Sam Altman: In terms of what we can do, I think people can participate, people can get involved. Kara talked about how tech companies’ leadership is overwhelmingly male and that’s true. But the most skewed field I know of right now is machine learning PhDs, which are by graduation rates, 98, 99 percent men. And that is the group of people, in my opinion, I may turn out to be wrong, that will have the most effect on the future of the world that we live in. And what we can do is get involved. We can encourage a much broader, a much more diverse group of people to go into that field, and into other fields as well. We can start societal conversations now, before we’re reacting from the other side like we are from how social media gets used. We can start conversations now about what decision should we make, what do we want society to look like. Before we actually make all these changes, are we sure they’re good, are we sure they’re bad, which ones should we try to stop, which ones should we do more of? But I don’t know how to do that because I think society is very good at reacting to yesterday’s problems and very bad at investing a huge amount of time and energy and thought into the problems that will occur in 10 years.Manny Yekutiel: But Sam, aren’t you the chair of OpenAI, aren’t you the person that’s supposed to be thinking of ...Sam Altman: Oh, I’m trying to. The question is what can other people do? I’m trying to make that my major focus. That’s why I’m not running for governor.I’m going to Mars with Elon Musk, that’s my job.Manny Yekutiel: That does not sound very fun.Are you kidding? He’s so much fun. What are you talking about? Elon Musk is the most fun, correct?Sam Altman: Elon is very fun.He’s very fun.Manny Yekutiel: Okay we’ve now veered off topic.Sam Altman: Maybe I’ll change that to the best interview in tech for my other answer.Yeah, he is one of them.[ad]Manny Yekutiel: Okay, so I think it’s time. We’re going to open it up to audience questions. I just got a cramp in my leg. Ow. Okay, so here’s how it’s going to work, oh we have hands already, that’s great. So we have a wireless mic and I’m going to point to you and then we’re going to hand you the wireless mic. Better to ask a specific question to one or the other because that way we get more questions, so if you have a specific question for someone please let them know who it is, and then please pass the mic back up, okay? We’ve got one mic. Also, also, also, please say your name and stand up. First question is going to be over there, so let’s pass this mic down, yeah, you right over here.Aurora:     Hi, my name is Aurora Quinn Elmer, I’m doing work helping communities and organizations figure out how to definitively and effectively deal with sexual predators when they’re identified, with the possibility of applying restorative justice when that’s appropriate. Particularly for lower-level offenses or miscommunications. I’m curious to hear from both of you how you would like to see us shift how we respond to accusations in the #MeToo era. I think we haven’t quite sorted that out yet, as far as I can tell.Oh, you take that one. We are reaching a really interesting point now in the #MeToo stuff. There’s still these astonishing stories, I don’t know if you read the Les Moonves ones in the New York Times today. You should, it’s disturbing. Although it’s kind of low-level corruption on his part, the way he’s trying to cover up in order to get the money that he wants. It’s a big question because these stories go around the world so quickly. Everything gets amplified so quickly and then people get exhausted by the amount of discussion. And what’s really critically important is the people, women, especially women, should have voices and be heard. The stories should be heard. And I think one of the things that we did when we covered the Ellen Pao trial, which I think we were pretty good on at Recode, one of things that I did as an editor is I decided to cover it, I hate to use this comparison, like the Super Bowl. And we had five stories a day on it, and we decided just to put a lot of attention on it. We had two reporters on it, two great reporters. And we covered the hell out of it in lots of different aspects.Sam Altman: You live-blogged it, it was sentence by sentence.Yeah, we did. We did everything because we thought it was an important intersection of sexism, fucked-up VC-ness that everybody knows about and everybody writes about and power and money and influence and stuff like that. One of the problems is when you have things like Twitter or whatever, things just ... it exhausts people, so then it becomes noisy and then the real point is never, you can’t have a substantive discussion about problems and everybody feels in a crouch position and doesn’t know what to do. Legitimate stories, everyone gets ... men get I can’t say anything. Women now want to talk a lot and about it, but then there’s so many different stories, then you’ve got the cable stations doing different things and it becomes sort of circus. It’s really hard in this era not to be twitchy, right? In terms of what you’re doing. So it’s really hard to know how you substantively make changes. My feeling is again, the issue is systems. The system is broken in a way that doesn’t allow, it’s broken against certain people, that certain people stay in power, and those people like to stay in power and they’re not going to give it up willingly. How do you change the systems at their very core is really the super difficult problem from my perspective.Sam Altman: The area where I have the most expertise on this is not about lower-income, lower-status women, but female founders in the YC portfolio. I think there’s still a hugely long way to go there. And I think, my new belief about how that problem is actually starting to get solved is the LPs that give VCs their money to invest. Now that they have decided to demand reporting and transparency on this, I think that’s the first time where I’m actually seeing the industry take this sufficiently seriously. I have sort of an unusual perspective on this whole thing because I was both, harassed as a founder 15 years ago, and it wasn’t that bad, but it’s always stuck in memory. And I’m friends with a lot of powerful men in VC who are on the other side of this. So I feel I see both sides of it now. At this point a very common complaint from YCs female founders is that male VCs will not engage with them in anything other than a conference room during the day with the door open with people in there. And that is a huge disservice to women in technology. And how that gets fixed, I mean I hear about it and I understand why people have the risk profile they do. And when I say, “Just don’t be an asshole and you’ll be fine 99 percent of the time,” people say, “Well what about that one percent? I’m not going to take that risk.” But the current state there, it’s clearly better than women being harassed but it’s deeply unfair to women. And I don’t know how you turn that around.Although, part of it is so funny because ... I’ve had people say that to me, it’s like what if someone says anything. Well don’t grab their ass, how bout that? Let’s start with that. Don’t kiss them. Don’t ask them out on date. Those are like, I’ll make a list for you, don’t do these things.Sam Altman: To be clear, I’m on your side of this, I’m just saying I don’t know how to make it happen.I know, but it’s such a vast overreaction by men to this. It’s crazy. Women don’t go around doing this all day. We manage to control ourselves even though we want to grab you guys. Well I don’t, but.Sam Altman: I was going to say.You do, I don’t. Opposite. But, sorry ... but you know what I mean.Sam Altman: I do.When I hear that I literally want to take the glass and throw it at their head. Sam Altman: I’m agreeing, I’m just saying this has become a huge problem.But that’s the first reaction, is, “How does it affect me?” Versus, “Wow, this is a systematic problem throughout society and maybe I’m a cause.” My son who is 13 is a champion debater and he goes, “Mom, what about men who get harassed?” And I was like, “What?” And he goes, “There are men that get harassed.” I go, “One percent.” And he’s like, “Yeah let’s talk about that.” I’m like, “Why? Why don’t we talk about the 99 percent? So we end up having this amazing debate about it, but to me it’s really interesting how he goes there. That’s where he goes, versus the 99 percent. I don’t send him to his room for that or anything like that. But it’s interesting. I don’t know how you ... just stop it. Just stop it. I don’t know what else to say.Manny Yekutiel: We can continue, or we can move to the next question. To the left, you have the mic.Joelle Stewart:    Hi, my name is Joelle Stewart and this question is for the would-be mayor, Kara Swisher. I am wondering about the real world ... I think what we don’t interrogate enough is the real world impacts of a lot of these tech platforms, not just in the sense of these mass genocides that are caused by some unnamed technology platforms, but for example the demographics of this room would not look the way that it does without the employment practices of the companies that we live around, let’s be real. I live in San Francisco, and am I the only black person here? Oh maybe there’s, oh hey, all right. All right, there’s a few of us, but not as many as there were probably 15 years ago. And so in light of things like Amazon going to Long Island city and Sidewalk Labs, the Google experiment that deigns to create a whole city, spoiler alert, I’m an urban planner so I’m really curious about this and your take on how these platforms and companies wielding their employment power and their economic power effects cities and how things can be a little bit different. It’s very weird that the employment patterns are reflected so heavily in cities. Blah, blah, blah. You know what I mean, so I’m wondering what you think about it. Thanks.That’s a big question. I think what you’re asking about is how we get, I believe, how do we get more diversity involved in this thing. Or to create cities that are less pushed apart by money, by race, by all kinds of things, correct?Joelle Stewart:    I’m wondering how to do we connect those two. Because I think that in San Francisco at least, it’s very desperate. People think oh my company is totally white, and the city is totally white and what coincidence, but it’s really connected.100 percent. Again, it goes to this thoughtlessness, how did this happen. And they act like it just happened. Years ago, and I tell this story a lot. I wrote a story, I’m not a city planner, what’s happened around cities is a lot to do with city planning, you know how segregation happens, it’s very clear. And in this city it’s about money, who can afford to live here? And then who they hire who then can afford to live here. They don’t see the connections between things and connections are very hard for a lot of these people who run these companies to make. They really can’t make connections of why this happens here or why, the way Hollywood people couldn’t connect why the way they depict women affected misogyny. It was really interesting thing today on Twitter, who was it? Was it Claire Danes, or someone was talking about what’s-her-name’s bikini.Audience member: Natalie Portman.Yes, Natalie Portman.Manny Yekutiel: Someone’s on Twitter here.Well Twitter was good today. It was an interesting debate. Jessica Simpson, she was just making a comment as a teenage girl. It was really an interesting, you should go look at it. But I’m getting off the topic. I think the way they hire, years ago I wrote a story called, besides the men and the women of Facebook, I like to drop these things down every and then, was the board of Twitter. It was 10 white men of the same age almost, like exactly the same. You could have just, I didn’t know them all apart from each other. And I called the CEO Dick Costolo, who’s great. He’s a great guy, and I said, “How did you get 10 of the same exact white men on the board?” He goes, “I don’t know, it just happened.” And I was like, “It couldn’t happen, that’s mathematically impossible, like how did that happen?” And so I wrote a story and I believe, I literally think I should have quit after I wrote this lead. I said, “The board of Twitter which has three Peters and a Dick,” which was so good. I should have gone done, and I’m gone. I had a really interesting discussion about it, he thought it just had happened that way. And what was fascinating to me ...Manny Yekutiel: Really?Yes. He really did. Honestly. It was interesting, and he did and other people did it when I went to question him is like, “Well you know Kara, we have standards.” That’s the word they use. I said, “It’s really interesting that you always use the word standards when it comes to adding women or people of color to a board, but you never do it when it’s 10 white men, who by the way are driving your company into a wall, just so you know, Twitter’s not doing very well.” You know what I mean? Or Yahoo, or any of them. Standards is only applied to people who are trying to get in. It’s that kind of stuff. So I can’t tell you about cities, but I do think these decisions are made purposely and they pretend ... unconscious bias, it’s very conscious as far as I can tell, or thoughtlessness. I think we need thoughtful politicians who say, look, like the NIMBY/YIMBY thing, just call it out. Look yYou’re going to put people with different economic and racial — in different places all throughout the city, everyone’s going to do. You’ve got to have leaders that do that and that’s really, I think, the problem, is that they don’t do that. At these companies you’ve got to have leaders that say, “I have 70 percent white guys running this places, I need to change this. I can’t look at it like I’m dropping standards.” You know what I mean? It can’t be looked at like that, because that’s the way they see it in their brain, that it’s a favor rather than an asset. Do you have a thought on it? How do you solve city problems and racism?Sam Altman: I also feel unqualified to opine on that. But other than, I think, the data is really clear that making housing affordable is a hugely beneficial thing to people that are younger or disenfranchised in any way. And I think San Francisco had a catastrophic failure to do that.Manny Yekutiel: So we have a question to the right here. You in the white sweater, but do you mind coming over here away from the speaker because it’s going to do that crazy loud whale noise thing. Yep.Peggy:    Hi, I’m Peggy. I wanted to change the topic to the politicization of data and who owns your data. And so we all subscribe to these social platforms and how who owns our attention, right? And how that might change antitrust laws or the definition of monopoly and I’m interested to hear both your thoughts on that.Manny Yekutiel: Thank you.Sam Altman: I mean, I think you own your data and people agree on that. The hard part is at the internet giants, their network effects or monopolies or whatever coded word you want to use for the fact you can’t pick an alternative. If all your friends are on Instagram, you’re going to be on Instagram. And so, what true ownership of data would mean, if you stop liking Instagram’s rule you could go somewhere else and have a good experience, but you don’t really have an option to do that. And I think that’s what the current consumer data protection laws and the antitrust laws and just more general consumer protection laws fail to take into account. Is that ... people say, if you don’t like Facebook, just don’t use any of Facebook’s products. It’s much easier said than done. And sure you can do it. And some people do. Does anyone in this room not use any Facebook product at least once a week. None? Truly none?Manny Yekutiel: Honestly Sam, I feel like I’ve tried multiple times, I’ve deleted the fucking app. I’ve turned by phone to black and white, I’ve really tried to get off it and I feel like I actually chemically cannot do it.Sam Altman: Right.No, Facebook is a bloated app that is exhausting.Sam Altman: But you don’t use Instagram, WhatsApp, nothing?No, Instagram is a museum of people’s performative bullshit. And Oculus, I kind of like VR. I kind of like VR.Manny Yekutiel: But you use it, honey, don’t you? Sorry, Kara.What, Instagram? No, I’m not on Instagram.Manny Yekutiel: Okay, you’re on Twitter all day. There’s better or worse.Twitter I like because it’s a cesspool. Sam Altman: My point is, I think the data question is easier than, less important than how do we actually have consumer choice in a world where we have these monopolies that are bigger than AT&T at the peak of it. And I think that’s what’s getting lost in the conversation because it’s so hard no ones willing to actually talk about it.I think they’re going to be broken up. I do. I think there’s going to be some regulatory ... It’s going to be really interesting around antitrust, there’s some really interesting legal theories going around about all of it. But I think the amount of data that these companies have on you and how they collect it is ...Manny Yekutiel: So what does that mean, you literally use Twitter with this half of the room, but not the people on this half of the room?I don’t know, well, they’ve done it before. It’s happened before, so I don’t know. I think probably that’s where it’s going to go. If I had to guess, very similar to what everyone said, “Who could affect Microsoft?” and then bingo, they affected Microsoft. So I think there’s going to be some sort of regulatory relief because these companies can’t resist their Borg-like tendencies to want to suck up every piece of information.Peggy:    But who is there defining...I think if the Democrats get in power, used to be friends of tech. They’re not so friendly to tech anymore. I can tell you from visiting them. I think you’ve got a lot of people in the Democratic Party who now are pretty pissed about what happened and have some thoughts on that.Manny Yekutiel: Okay, we have a question all the way in the back. Yes, you. I know you’re surprised. All the way in the back. Do you want to just get up and project? Yeah, let’s do that. Just say your name and please project.Louisa:    Yeah, my name is Louisa. My question is for Sam. It’s about how you think about preventing AI from ending civilization in general and how you think about that in terms of domestic versus what seems to be an arms race between us and China.Sam Altman: To say this extremely clearly, we will, I can’t promise when, I can’t even make a confident prediction if I want. But we will, we, humanity will at some point build digital intelligence that surpasses human intelligence. People don’t think about that much because it’s so uncomfortable, and it’s so hard to say. That’s an event horizon. It’s just really hard to see what the world looks like on the other side. I think it really matters that it’s built in a way where the benefit of it is distributed widely throughout humanity and decisions about how we use it and how we build is distributed widely through humanity, not to make this a commercial for OpenAI, but I do genuinely think that’s super important.I think we will be able to learn the collective human value system. I think there will be big arguments about what human values we should keep and what were bad and that we should let go and who gets to decide that and how we vote on it will be sort of, in some sense, the hardest problem humanity’s ever faced.But I now believe in a way that I didn’t use to, or at least I used to not be as confident that the technological problems of how we build an AI, like a super AI that shares human values that align with the goals of humanity. I think that’s technically possible.So that’s the good news. The bad news is I think the collective action, collective governance problem is going to be super hard. And I think this is, as we were saying earlier, society just ... evolution’s slower than technology? I think we’re going to have to ... We are likely going to have to react to this at a speed that we’re not good at. Which is why, I think, it’s important that the technology industry now try to get people thinking about this. And try to figure out the world that we want to collectively build. But Sam, you know who has hired most of the AI in machine learning? What are the two companies that control most of it right now?Sam Altman: I’d say that OpenAI put out half the most important results in the year, something like that. And we’re only 80 people. One of the things that is cool about this. But the two companies that are really hiring heavily are Google and Facebook.Sam Altman: The most number of people. But one of the things that’s cool about this and one of the things that’s magical about software is if you have people that are like a little bit smarter or a little better mission and a little bit better plan, just like startups always can, you can beat a company that has tens or hundreds of thousands of people. I think that’s always true about software. And it’s exponentially true about artificial intelligence.So I think looking at the number of people that companies have is the wrong way to think about it. I think looking at sort of maybe number of transistors under the control of the company will turn out to be the right way to think about it.Manny Yekutiel: Just a quick follow-up for you, Sam. What do you think specifically is the role of the 500, 600 or some elected federal officials that have just been brought into government to do to kind of steer the conversation, right? ‘Cause if you’ve been elected to the 2018 Congress and this is something that you cared about, what is the role of those people?Sam Altman: The tricky balance is there’s two very different ways that this is really important. One is the changes that it’s going to have into the economy and jobs in the next few years. And that’s a huge issue and that’s what’s affecting your constituents today. And that’s where people are going to feel pain today and next year and the year after. And then there are the questions about how is this going to fundamentally reshape the world in 20 years, 30 years. And how you as a politician prioritize and balance those two things, which they’re both about AI but other than that they’re actually totally different, are very hard. And I think our system, especially with Congress on a two-year cycle, even the presidency on a four-year cycle, is going to do a much better job at the first. I actually think we’re going to get that right. I think we’re gonna figure out how to deal with that. But how we kind of like pick this long-term future, I think that’s going to take courage and sort of force that in a politician.There’s nobody working on it. Let’s be clear.Sam Altman: There’s nobody working on it.I mean, right now we don’t have a chief science officer running the office of science. If we have an Ebola situation, we’re fucked. Like truly fucked. We don’t have a chief science person, we don’t have a chief technology officer. That whole area has been gutted out right now. It’s really quite a ... I mean, I think one guy, there’s one guy in there who is one of the deputy CTOs. He was in real estate before or something like that. He was. What’s his name?Sam Altman: I don’t know.Ross?Sam Altman: Michael Kratsios.Whatever. Whatever. They were like, “Meet him.” I was like “No! I refuse. I’m not meeting a real estate guy to talk about tech.”Manny Yekutiel: I think that I maybe, okay.Or maybe you tried it?Manny Yekutiel: All right, next question. Right over here.We need more smart people.Manny Yekutiel: You’ve got your hand raised for a while. Yeah, you! Yes, yeah!Chris: I’m Chris. You have made mention before of being fatigued from news and that potential resource being repleted. Sam, you mentioned the exponential growth curve, I think a nod to the singularity. The Weinstein brothers make mention of the sense-making apparatus when referring to the news. And I think the disruption of the economics that publishing news today. When you believe are going to be the upcoming sense-making apparati of dealing with the increasing intentional load we’re going to see as our growth exponentially expands?Manny Yekutiel: Does someone want to repeat that question?I think he’s saying, how do we deal with all these screens. Is that right? Or something like that. The incoming. Yeah, the incoming. Manny Yekutiel: How do we take in all the news?I literally don’t wanna take a shower anymore because I’m like, “What happened? Wait what? We just declared war on France?” Like just on Twitter for five seconds and then it’s over. I don’t know. Sam, you’re ...?Sam Altman: Well I think that’s a stressful and unhealthy way to live, personally ... And frankly very unhygienic of you.I shower. I just have the phone in there with a baggy.Sam Altman: And no, I think you need to give yourself permission to not follow every post, not read every news article. The things that cause outrage and that feel like ... There was probably something that happened in February of this year that this entire room was talking about all day long. And you were putting aside work, time that you could have spent with your family, your friends, your hobbies because this thing was so important. And you couldn’t shower because if you even were away from your computer for five minutes you were going to miss the conversation. And none of you remember what that is. And it’s okay to miss it. I guess it was “shithole countries,” but go ahead. Sam Altman: It’s okay to miss that. No it’s not. You need not to miss that one. Sam Altman: But there’s no way to stay informed and stay sane right now. There’s just no way to do it. Like I think we ... one of the things that is happening is everyone seems so fatigued and stressed and unhappy. And I wish I could just like ... we could all take a day off and go for walk in the woods. And the world is gonna keep spinning. There will be plenty of problems when we get back. We can read about them then. Like your job is to stay on top of this, so maybe you have to. But it’s not most people’s jobs.No, but here’s the thing. I do think there is a push toward less twitchiness. That there’s more that ... You know, I’ve just noticed how fast our podcasts are growing. And when I started the Recode Decode podcast everyone was like, “Kara you can’t do it in an hour. People won’t listen an hour. They won’t like an hour. You need to do it 26 seconds.” And I was like, “No, I’m gonna do an hour.” And they’re like, “You can’t do an hour. You can’t do an hour.” And I’m like, “I think people like a substantive discussion. I like a substantive discussion. I’m just gonna keep talking.” And do an interview with someone for an hour so that they and they talk. Sam, you were on there.Sam Altman: I was.Yeah. And it was an hour discussion, right? And it changes the whole nature of it. And it’s only grown. So I do think there is some, there is something where the twitchiness, people are pushing away from it. And you can see it in entertainment. There are some really wonderful entertainment shows that take commitment and are interesting. And so I don’t necessarily know if we’re all, that we don’t push that away. It seems that people are pushing that away a little bit in terms of indicators that we’re getting from the stuff that people read on our sites.Sam Altman: Can I share a quick story?Manny Yekutiel: Oh my god, yes please!Sam Altman: I was speaking to a very dear friend of mine and he came to see me for some life advice. And he said, “I’m trying to figure out what I want to do. I’ve spent the last 10 years on the internet. I have a” — and he does have one, for sure — “I have a very bad case of internet addiction. You” — he pointed to me — “have staged an intervention before. Other friends of mine have too. None of you have been able to make it work. And I realize that for 10 years I’ve been wasting my time on Twitter reading the news in online forums. And my partner left me. None of my jobs have worked out. And now I’m about to turn 40 and I don’t know what I wanna do with my life.”And it was just that, and that’s all true. And it was just this gut-wrenching moment where I couldn’t tell him like, “Oh. It’s okay.” I’m like, “Yeah that really did happen.” And I think we’re gonna see this a lot more. ‘Cause there’s so much in the world and so much of it’s so bad. But it’s easy to get immobilized by it. And if it’s not your job to stay on top of everything that’s happening ... do less of it. You’ll still know a lot, and there will be plenty to be outraged about. But like, read a ... One rule that I have for myself, that I’m trying to have for myself, is if I’m looking at a website and kind of like mindlessly doing it, and I hit, like, open a new tab and type in the same website again. Which I do more than I’d like to admit. I close the computer and I either have to go for a walk or read a physical book. And I’m not perfect about that. Sometimes I just keep going. But I’m trying to be better about that. Because I think it’s ... you know, we were talking, there are these dopamine systems. It’s deep in our biology to react to this and we haven’t had time to build up societal antibodies yet. I think younger people are changing. I have to say my sons, they’re very good at putting it down. Much different. It’s a really interesting thing. I watch them. But they use it in a different way. It’s used for certain things. They just don’t use other things. Like I watched “Gilligan’s Island” till my head’ll fall off when I was a kid. Like you used to do things and then you’d switch them into other things. Being upset on the train — I was in New York and everyone was looking at their phones. And I was like, “Oh everyone is on their phones.” I made like I was grumpy in a way. But then I thought, well before everybody had a newspaper and was looking at a book. You know what I mean? No one was staring out into space on a subway.Sam Altman: I remember being bored as like this abstract thought from a long time ago that I can barely hold on to. And I miss that. Manny Yekutiel: I do too. I feel like, no offense, but I feel like we have seen in our lifetime, I actually don’t know how, but I remember. Keep going. Dig.Manny Yekutiel: Oh goddamn. I remember going home and being like, “Great, I get to go on the internet now!” And telling my mom to get off the phone so that I could log on to get on the internet. And it was this thing you could do for a special 30 minutes and the rest of the time you just had to figure out what to do. And now ... and in our lifetime I’ve seen now we’re always on the internet all the time. And I’m always nervous. Sweetie, I was around when there were rotary phones so I don’t worry about the age thing. Like we had the [rotary phone noises], that kind of thing. So you know I think it’s just it depends on these things are built to be addictive. And that’s another thing. They hire tons and tons of people to addict you. And everybody knows that. And again, when we’re sitting around saying, “Oh they’re trying really hard.” They hired 20 PhDs to make you push that red button and they did that on purpose. And to pretend otherwise and then them to go, “Oh I don’t know why people are addicted”? When they’re handing you liquor. Sam Altman: That is the thing that I think, I mean, it’s hard to pick one thing that tech companies have done the worst because they’re so many to pick on. But that one thing, the fact that they have figured out how to hack you in biology to make us unhappy I think is like, when history books are written it’s going to be like, “What the fuck? Did that actually happen?”But it’s the same people that are doing the other stuff. That’s what I’m saying. To make them into like hapless victims of their own success is a mistake. They are purposely doing this with every choice they make. And then when it goes awry they’re like, “Who knew?”Sam Altman: I think that you and I agree. And there’s plenty to be critical about. But I’m just trying to say that there’s also things I’m thankful for.But again, I agree, but that’s not critical, it’s truthful. Like there’s a difference between ...Sam Altman: Those are truthful and I think ...But when you say bad things about them it’s like, “Don’t be so critical.” But I’m like, “I’m just pointing out that you’ve made billions of dollars off of other people’s privacy, off of other people’s attention, and taking advantage of other people’s stuff.” So I ... that’s all.Sam Altman: And I agree. I’m pointing out that I think that and I also am glad that these companies exist. And I know that I may be in the minority in the room for that. But I think they’ve done great good for society too. Manny Yekutiel: Shall we move on to the next question?Sure.Manny Yekutiel: We have a question to the right. Over there. Martha: Hi my name is Martha and I’m a founder and CEO of an early-stage political activism company and a former policy adviser so I think about these questions quite a bit, given some of the things you were saying about social media platforms being built for addictive behavior and consequences that are detrimental to our society as a whole. Even life-or-death situations. Do you think that Silicon Valley investors — not just business leaders but investors — have a responsibility to demand less revenue? When you think about, especially me, when I think about my business model and how much money we can make in five years, a lot of it is dependent on that kind of behavior. So do you think that we need to change our business model?Yeah. I mean, I think that their business models are their business models. I don’t know, how would you change them? As Wall Street is Wall Street, right? How are you gonna do this? And they won’t change this. And just look at, I’ll switch it to another thing, the murder of this journalist Khashoggi. Do you know how many companies in Silicon Valley are funded by the Saudis? Are you seeing Uber handing the money back? I’m gonna be asking Dara Khosrowshahi that tomorrow. “Are you handing the money back?” He’s a murderous thug, according to Lindsey Graham, and if Lindsey Graham is saying it it’s absolutely true, right? You know? They’re not gonna do it. They’re not gonna do it. Like there’s an expression, I think my ... someone told it to me, someone in my family was like, “You’re so poor. All you have is money.” And they don’t wanna change these business plans. They don’t wanna change the addictive ones. They don’t wanna change the data-sucking ones. They don’t wanna change the advertising ones. They don’t wanna change any of them. They just don’t. They don’t want to do it. They like the money. They like the power. They like everything. They just happen to wear Allbirds. That’s the only difference between them and a Wall Street mogul. And at least the Wall Street moguls I prefer because they’re like, “We’re rapacious assholes.” And that’s the end of it. And you’re like, “All right. I get you. Let’s have a beer.”But I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t think they’ll do it. I don’t think they’ll do it. But I just, I don’t know. Do you?Sam Altman: I mean, look, this is easier for me to say because I don’t need more money, but I certainly won’t invest in companies that I will be successful but would be bad for the world. Sometimes I invest thinking it would be good for the world and I get it wrong. But I won’t go into it doing that. And I try not to let YC do that either. And I think that in the long run that does work and I think that it makes you more successful. We certainly tell companies that come to us in many specific instances like, “You could go build that product. You could do that service. You could sell to that customer and you would make more revenue. But you’d be compromising something more important. You shouldn’t do that.”At OpenAI, when we wrote our charter we talked about the scenarios where we would or wouldn’t make money. And how just the things we wouldn’t be willing to do no matter how much money they made. And we made this public so the public would hold us accountable to that. And I think that’s really important. I think there are different investors that think differently. One thing that I have a lot of sympathy for is people who came from nothing, got a job at a company where they’re getting an incredible salary but the company is doing things that they don’t like or don’t fit their own ethical compass. And they’re not in the situation I’m in. And they really struggle with what the right answer do there is. And I’m not in their shoes now.But with the Juul stuff. There are a lot of Silicon Valley people in that. How did you think about that?Sam Altman: So the Juul one?This is this vaping thing.Sam Altman: This vaping thing? This is the vaping thing you must keep away from a 16-year-old boy named Louie Swisher, but go ahead. I now have a vaping thing.Sam Altman: I hadn’t looked into that.I own one myself.Sam Altman: In depth it seems really problematic. What someone told me, I haven’t researched this at all, but someone told me is that pure nicotine is actually not that bad for you. And that the science on that ... Yeah, I assume that’s right. So I haven’t studied ...You may not have children right now, but go ahead.Sam Altman: I haven’t studied it. It seems really problematic from what I know. I wouldn’t invest. Because there would be a lot of people dead. That was, that should have been an obvious one for lots of people. Manny Yekutiel: It’s almost eight o’clock so we have the last audience question. And I know there’s a lot of questions. There’s gonna be some time afterwards but right over here. Last audience question. Hillary:    Thank You. Hi. My name is Hillary and I ... So I’ve heard people talk about open crypto networks that present potentially open computing systems where maybe platforms like Facebook could be built in ways that shift the power and maybe the revenue model. Giving a little more power to users. And I was wondering what you guys think about that and the prospects there. For solving some of these problems that we’ve talked about.Sam Altman: I so wanna see a single crypto project shipment actually get used. Then I will sort of stop dismissing them out of hand. But until that happens, I don’t think I can point ... I haven’t been working like super long but yeah a decently long chunk of time now, and I can’t point to any piece of technology that has had as much ... It has so captured the discussion of the industry with so little actual use. The amount of money that has gone into crypto projects that are somewhere in between incompetent and fraud, I have never seen in any other industry.Well, the early internet. Sam Altman: That one I didn’t see. I did.Sam Altman: I could believe that one’s worse.Je was there. I was there. There were a lot of...Sam Altman: Je.Je. Me. That’s me in French. Sam Altman: I got it.I think I got that language right, right? Okay.Sam Altman: So maybe we can say it’s the worst since then.Well, there were a lot of like, there was a lot of scammery in the early internet. It really was. It was like crazy at the time.Hillary:    I’m sort of asking like, let’s suppose like in concept where we rule out all the scam.What about just you getting paid for your privacy? Like you get to ... like years ago when I was writing a book about AOL, Steve Case got up in some investment commerce and said that we’re making $76 from each user. He had some number that he assigned to it. And I put my hand up, I said,”Can I have my $35 please?” And he’s like, “What?” And I’m like, “Why shouldn’t you pay me half that money and maybe I’ll give you more.” They never come up with that idea. Like just being paid for your ... it’s not like giving away your liver, I don’t think. But what do you want a ... should you be paid?Sam Altman: The promise is so seductive and maybe it is a way to get around the issue of these unopen protocols that you’re on one now. That’s where everything is, you can’t leave. Maybe if Instagram was on some sort of blockchain, something or the other, you could leave in some sense. Or use another version of it. But I think we’re learning something fundamental about human coordination and governance, where these de-essentialized projects so far are just not working. The promise is incredibly seductive. I hope it happens. The current ecosystem of the crypto, blockchain world seems, today, this may change. This may be like a burnout after the dot-com and then the Facebook rises later. But the system today seems unlikely to produce that. I really hope it gets there. And I really hope it does someday. The promise is tantalizing. Manny Yekutiel: So the final question I have, which is something that I’ve been asking a lot of these panelists about is what is one thing that the people that are in this physical room right here can actually take away and do to address some of the issues that have been brought up in this conversation?Sam Altman: You quit Facebook. I’m pretty impressed.Quit it. I never used it. Just for work. I just use it for work until I understand it. Here’s the thing. If you’re employees of these companies, you are their base. Like I hate to use a Trump term, but you are their base. Listen to the Google Walkout Organizers podcast we did. I think it was six women and one man. It was astonishing. And they were astonishing, articulate, strong, still loving their jobs, but really said, “Enough.” And they also just didn’t want to talk about issues of sexual harassment around which the first thing started because they were paying someone $90,000,000 who had real issues to go, which is astonishing they did that. If you’re employees of these companies, ask questions of these things. It is not disloyal to say, “Is this the way we’re doing it?” Because the premise of Silicon Valley, at least when I got here and this was the good part, was that it was changing the world, that it was better. Then they went on and on about how better they were. Now demand that they be better. You know, just demand. As employees, to me, you have the power to do that. And that doesn’t mean dropping a dime to me or anybody else. Or fine, do that. I would like that. And it’s helped me a lot in that way. You have a part and a power with these people. Manny Yekutiel: Someone you may have ...You have power that you don’t understand that you can use and voices. And so I think it’s really important for you as employees or working here to say, “No.” Like, “No this is not gonna stand. This is not gonna stand.” And everyone who does that, you can affect them. You don’t need me to affect them. You don’t need powerful people to do it. You have that. And not saying like everyone is powerful but you really can, especially in this industry and these leaders are listening. I think they do it, and then they do get affected by these things. So that’s what I would say to do.Sam Altman: I think that’s the most important point. I hadn’t thought of saying that but I will ... that’s what I think is the right answer. I think that it is employees that the companies that have more power than any other constituencies. That’s the group that these companies have to keep happy. And the challenge is it’s such a premium in this industry. And I do think that this industry is better then others at listening to employees and trying to adapt. That employees at the large tech companies have much much more power than they realize. The other thing that I was going to say is just, I think it’s fine to spend most of your time thinking about the problems and the challenges of today, I think that’s really good. But if you believe that sort of you are living for the future and all the people that are going to come out after you, you got to at least allocate some to the problems of the future. And you’ve got to spend some of your time and your resources and your effort trying to think about not the problems of 2019 but of the problems of 2039. And it’s hard to do that without concerted effort because the problems of today are so big.And so to me it’s about making choices. Like be an adult. I just like so many times when they’re ... I talk about juvenilization of men here is Silicon Valley. Or letting these people have a pass or whatever. Or just giving people passes. Like, act like an adult. Like what would an adult do. And not see that as a negative thing, you know what I mean?Here it’s like oh, everyone’s young, or we have to have a young person, or that young mentality. Like there is something good about acquired wisdom. I’m only saying that because I’m 412. But it’s true. It’s not just a power to say no to these people, but it’s a power to say yes, this is the way we should go. You should be doing both things. You don’t want to be a hindrance, but you should say no appropriately and yes appropriately. And that’s what adult people do. And take responsibility. That’s the other thing. Take responsibility for what you’re doing. And stop acting like the things you’re doing don’t have an impact because they absolutely do. And get out across this country. And I don’t mean doing Mark Zuckerberg and visiting every cow in every fucking state. Like don’t do that, that’s bad. But get out to understand how people actually live their lives. Not a place where there’s hot and cold running kombucha. Like there are other places. There’s other places and it doesn’t mean that you aren’t as justifiable as they are ‘cause that’s really irritating too, to say the real Americans live here. Real Americans live everywhere. But do start to understand how other people live, paycheck to paycheck. They have hard times with healthcare and nutrition. And they have lots of stuff like that. To me that’s acting like an adult. Sam Altman: Can I make one pleasant comment off of that? It’ll be fast. I think one thing that had gone wrong with the move into the internet is that we have evolved some biological protections for how we act with someone in person. And there’s most of the time, we have some compassion that just sort of happens when you’re with another person physically. Some level of politeness that often happens. Not always. But on the internet that biological protection seems to have gone away and it’s so easy to just cast people as just the other. To cast people as stupid or Luddites or racists or just out of touch or drug addicts or whatever. And in my experience, I have found that my own preconceptions of people when I meet them on the internet or when they’re mean to me on the internet or I get in a fit with someone on Twitter, I’m always willing to think the worst. And if I meet them in person, I always find myself thinking the best. And I think this is something that has gone deeply wrong about the internet. And if you just get out and meet very different people with even a little bit of an open mind, your biology will take over a lot of the rest. Manny Yekutiel: So I mean, first of all, and I have to say I don’t know if we could have planned this before but that is the perfect segue into why we built this space. Because the premise was that these conversations, some of them are much more productive to be had in person. And so I’m really honored deeply that both of you would take time out of your busy schedules to join us tonight, and be in conversation. And especially for flying here for this conversation. So a really big round of applause for Kara and Sam. We’re doing things here every day, sometimes multiple times a day.

"Mike Gravel, 2020’s oddest Democratic presidential candidate, explained",2019-05-27,Vox,['Dylan Scott'],"Filed under:Mike Gravel, the anti-war zealot, is running for president on Twitter.Mike Gravel dropped out of the 2020 presidential race on August 6. Here’s the rest of the Democratic field.Former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel is running for president. Seriously.Gravel isn’t holding campaign events. He hasn’t stepped foot in Iowa or New Hampshire. In fact, until a couple of teenagers called him in March and urged him to run for president again, he was just an 80-something former Democratic senator and 2008 presidential candidate quietly fading from the public’s memory. Now Gravel is the subject, if not exactly the author, of the 2020 presidential election’s oddest campaign.The former senator is a legend of the anti-war movement, having fought to end the Vietnam War draft and having taken the perilous step of entering the leaked Pentagon Papers into the official congressional record. He made a big splash in 2008, his last serious foray into politics, by hammering the other Democratic candidates for being too closely allied with the military-industrial complex. This was and is a serious guy.But that doesn’t change the fact that it was two teenagers who convinced Gravel to enter the 2020 race and that the same teens are effectively managing his campaign by running his Twitter account. Gravel is still a credible voice for the anti-war left and, during a primary largely defined by how little interest the competing candidates have shown in criticizing one another, his unusual campaign has been happy to take shots at other Democrats. It can only help to have online-savvy youngsters turning his anti-establishment message into Twitter-friendly Marie Kondo memes.You would be forgiven for not knowing what to make of Gravel 2020. We’ve never seen a protest candidate quite like this. His bid lost some luster when Gravel failed to qualify for the first Democratic presidential debate (what is a protest candidate without a platform from which to protest?), but his candidacy should be a reminder of two things: The energy on the anti-war left is real and the rules of presidential campaigning have been rewritten after Trump.It sounds like a tall tale — two random New York teenagers listen to the ribald socialist podcast Chapo Trap House, learn about Gravel, and then literally call him up and ask him to run for president — but that is more or less what happened.Gravel’s 2020 campaign started seemingly at random in mid-March, as his Twitter account announced he would run for president “not ... to win, but to bring a critique of American imperialism to the Democratic debate stage.” Splinter got the whole backstory from David Oks, the high school senior who along with his co-conspirator Henry Williams thought up this unlikely endeavor:Oks, a high school senior who has previously run for mayor of his small New York town, told Splinter that he and several friends are avid listeners of the Chapo Trap House podcast, which mentioned Gravel in a recent episode. About a week ago, he and a couple friends reached out to Gravel and asked if he would consider making another run for president. Their pitch was clear. “My friends and I were encouraging him to consider running for president with the idea being that he would not try to contest any primaries, he would just try to get into the Democratic debates,” he said.Oks and his friends were clearly inspired by Gravel’s performance in the 2008 debates, where he delivered a searing indictment of the vast majority of his fellow candidates for their support of the Iraq war and their continued commitment to American interventionism in the Middle East.Thus far, Gravel’s campaign has largely been limited to saucy tweets. Oks and his friends, who act as the senator’s voice on social media, have been aggressive about criticizing the center-left candidates running for the Democratic nomination. Frontrunner Joe Biden is the frequent target of the Gravel account’s vitriol.Cory Booker, the candidate of the preening centrists who like David Brooks and worry about ""a deficit of empathy,"" has absolutely nothing to say to those who inhabit the vast desolate lands in America and live in real poverty. His whole candidacy is a pageant of virtue-signaling. https://t.co/8trYBBoiG1The senator himself has appeared on a popular podcast from the lefty Intercept news organization and espoused the same message in an interview with the Washington Post’s David Weigel. He is not here to make friends. Here is a sampling of what Gravel told Weigel about some of his 2020 competitors, starting with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio:“I don’t think he’s a very good mayor,” said Gravel, a former senator from Alaska who, with much less fanfare, is running for president. He thought even less of other candidates. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) was an “empty shirt.” Climate-focused Washington Gov. Jay Inslee was running on “the safest issue any Democrat can run on.” Beto O’Rourke “jumped on tables like he had Saint Vitus’ dance.” Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who represented a district not far from Gravel’s adopted home, was a total mystery: “If he’d gotten anything done in Congress, wouldn’t I have heard about it?”You could boil down the entire Gravel candidacy, especially given its extremely online nature, to one tweet:Despite those pointed barbs and bemused media coverage of the unusual origins of his campaign, Gravel has struggled to gain mainstream acceptance that he is, in fact, a real candidate for president. Prominent polling outfits often leave him out of their 2020 surveys — and considering those polls help candidates qualify for the primary debates under the rules set up by the Democratic National Committee, that became a serious problem. Gravel’s campaign was left urging his fans to lobby polling firms to include him.Mike is getting EXCLUDED from the Quinnipiac poll - want to help us mend that?EMAIL: peter.brown@quinnipiac.edu, timothy.malloy@quinnipiac.edu. april.radocchio@quinnipiac.edu, mary.snow@quinnipiac.edu, pollinginstitute@quinnipiac.eduCALL: 203-582-5295Please help!Gravel’s campaign all but accused the DNC of blacklisting the senator. In this Medium post, aide Kate Tyler said the campaign called Democratic headquarters more than 200 times to get information about the party’s debate qualifications:In those 200 attempts, we spoke to a real person three times. The first person told us they’d call back, the second transferred us to a voicemail that was never returned, and the third tried to send us back to the front desk. We’ve left messages and sent e-mails and scoured our contact lists for someone who might give us the time of day. After hundreds of man-hours with no results, we’re left with only one conclusion: we’re being stonewalled.To this day, we have yet to get in contact with someone with authority over debate qualifications. That means we have no more information than what is publicly available. That is completely unacceptable.When the DNC finally announced the 20 candidates who would participate in 2020’s first presidential debate, Gravel didn’t make the cut. He hasn’t gained much traction in the polls, even ones he was included in. The ad hoc campaign apparatus got Gravel on the national media’s radar, but it wasn’t quite enough to put him over the top and get him on the debate stage.You might think that’s a shame. Gravel certainly has something to say.The Democratic presidential campaign so far has been preoccupied with the idea of electability. The whole premise of Joe Biden’s campaign is that he can beat Donald Trump. Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, and other candidates have predicated their White House bids on a generational contrast with Trump. Elizabeth Warren is hoping that the candidate with a detailed plan for what they’d do as president can break through with the primary voters.But Gravel is distinct. When he entered the race, winning wasn’t even on the agenda. He (and his industrious young assistants) wanted to leave a mark on the debate. And while the infrastructure of his campaign might sound like the set-up for a late-night monologue joke, the point Gravel wants to make is deadly serious.Gravel is the anti-war, anti-“American foreign policy for the last 50 years” candidate. Some of his priorities are the same as every other Democrat: He wants to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal. But he also wants to end unilateral sanctions against other sovereign nations. He wants to close every American base in a foreign territory and cut US military spending by 50 percent.He wants to end American aid to Israel and Saudi Arabia. Mike Gravel, it is safe to say, says things you won’t see almost any other candidate say.It’s not as though Gravel is above making mistakes, but the man knows his message. After he made some ill-advised comments about Buttigieg’s sexual orientation, Gravel backtracked and then he turned his apology into a critique of American imperialism. You can decide for yourself how effective the pivot was — offensive comments about another candidate’s sex life are proof enough that being woke on war isn’t a cure against other blind spots — but it is illustrative of how singularly focused Gravel’s campaign is.Gravel has bona fides, dating back to his 12 years in the Senate from 1969 to 1981. He filibustered to try to end the draft during the Vietnam War. He read the Pentagon Papers into the congressional record. He opposed nuclear testing. After leaving office, he was an opponent of the Iraq war and criticized Barack Obama for his drone strike campaign.Look, he is a character. Gravel oddly campaigned for the vice presidential nomination in 1972. He ran for president in 2008 after nearly 30 years out of office, getting a viral moment for his troubles, and then pursued the Libertarian Party’s nomination when he quickly fell out of the Democratic running. He has talked about putting every piece of legislation up for a nationwide ballot referendum. Then a couple of teenagers convinced him to quote-unquote run for president again.But, as an uncompromising anti-war candidate, he’s still an interesting voice in the debate. Bernie Sanders didn’t formulate much of a foreign policy message in 2016 and, while he has worked to flesh out his platform, the left still really hasn’t pulled together a cohesive foreign policy message, as Vox’s Alex Ward recently outlined:The Democratic Party is a big tent, and the party’s left flank is increasingly out of step with more centrist Democrats who have espoused traditional US foreign policy positions for decades. And progressives have historically stumbled when trying to present a viable foreign policy alternative to the more military- and security-focused conservatives on the right.Other lefty candidates, such as Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), have some problematic associations (she has been criticized for meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad) that prevent them from being taken very seriously. Gravel has gravitas, if nothing else, on the issues he cares most about.Mike Gravel almost certainly isn’t going to be the next president. But he could give a voice to the anti-war left in a primary hurting for bigger and bolder ideas about how to reorient American foreign policy. That is, if he can ever get anybody to take him and his motley crew of unlikely campaign staff seriously.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Biden wants to bring Israel and Saudi Arabia together. But why?,2023-08-03,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:And who will actually get the most out of it? (Hint: Not Americans or Palestinians.)President Joe Biden’s top foreign policy advisers have been shuttling to Saudi Arabia in recent months for a mission impossible: the normalization of diplomatic relations between the state of Israel and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.The two countries have never had diplomatic relations. Until recently, most Arab states refused to have a relationship with Israel, objecting to the occupation of Palestinian land.But the Biden administration is trying to formalize the fact that Israel and Saudi Arabia in recent years have quietly grown closer, in part due to their shared enmity for Iran’s Middle East influence and through less-public collaborations on technology and the military. And several other Arab states normalized relations with Israel under President Donald Trump’s Abraham Accords in 2020. Those transactional deals induced Arab states to make peace in return for the goodies they had sought from the US and Israel. The Biden administration initially distanced itself from that Trump policy but has since redoubled efforts, with Saudi Arabia as the prize.Israel locking in ties with Saudi Arabia, home to the two holiest mosques in Islam and with incredible petro wealth, would be a breakthrough. But it’s also a long shot, and a seemingly bizarre priority for Team Biden to put such intensive political capital into.Any new agreement would be detached from the current internal politics of both countries. Israel’s radical far-right government has already shown it prioritizes the annexation of Palestinian land, which would run headlong into the even minor concessions to Palestinians that Biden is reportedly seeking as part of the deal. Such a realignment would be unlikely to resonate among Saudis. Israel’s normalization deals with other Arab countries have been very unpopular.And it likely would do little for Palestinians, unlike the much more ambitious goal then-Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia put forward in 2002. The Arab Peace Initiative, as it was later called, held out a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and Arab states. The establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, based on United Nations resolutions, would come in exchange for Arab states’ recognition of Israel. The Arab League endorsed the unprecedented offer, but the government of Israel rejected it.Trump’s 2020 accords with the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and Bahrain, and today’s unlikely prospect of normalization with Saudi, however, represent a much different type of deal. Any arrangement the Biden administration secures would likely be smaller and bilateral (not comprehensive); in many senses, it would simply codify aspects of the already-booming backroom ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. At best, it might offer some limited protections to Palestinians, while Saudi Arabia asks for significant carrots from the US. The scale of those asks — a NATO-esque security guarantee, high-tech weapons, and a civilian nuclear program — surpass the usefulness of the deal for American interests. Which leads to the question: Whose interests would normalization serve? As Chas Freeman, a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, put it, “I don’t see what the US gets, except we pay a huge price.”Since Biden’s 2022 visit to Saudi Arabia, the US has prioritized normalization. National security adviser Jake Sullivan traveled to the kingdom several times to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who goes by MBS, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited recently, too.“We have the interest and bandwidth to promote normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia,” Sullivan said in May. The normalization, as it is being discussed in Washington policy circles, would not feature the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. That departs from the 2002 Saudi-led Arab Peace Initiative, which centered on Israel ceasing its military occupation and adhering to international resolutions in exchange for peace with the countries of the Arab League.The Saudi-Israel deal wouldn’t be a just or comprehensive peace. While Blinken said this spring that any normalization “should advance the well-being of the Palestinian people,” it’s not clear what that means for Gaza, or whether there would be a settlement freeze or halt to policies in the occupied West Bank that amount to annexation. (Would the deal be worth it if it included those things? In 2020, Israel had pledged to stop its West Bank annexation plan as part of its normalization with the Emirates. Now, the current Israeli government has in essence returned to annexationist policies and strained Israel-UAE ties, so it’s difficult to imagine such a commitment making a difference today.) And it seems less of a priority from at least part of the Saudi side too. King Salman has reportedly stood up for the importance of a Palestine component for normalization. But his son, MBS, who is the de facto ruler of the kingdom, does not appear to hold Palestine as central for these talks. If a normalization deal isn’t primarily about Palestine, then what would it be about? The US wants to pull Saudi Arabia, and the Middle East more broadly, away from China’s orbit. And that requires a projection of US diplomacy.  Israel has much to gain. Given Saudi Arabia’s international clout as the custodian of Mecca and Medina, Israel would also get remarkable buy-in from the Muslim world — all while continuing to downgrade the importance of Palestinian rights or a resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.Saudi Arabia has reportedly asked for US support for a civilian nuclear program and a security guarantee from the US along the lines of NATO, as well as other sweeteners. In particular, the Saudis want the military and intelligence technologies from Israel. Official trade between the two countries is low. But in 2017, Israel sold Saudi Arabia the notorious NSO Group spyware that can crack open phones, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s sign-off. Even after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of the Saudis, NSO Group continued to sell its technology to MBS. Normalization would significantly benefit Israel’s tech and arms industries, which seek to enter the Saudi market.But that carries risks. “Countries in the Gulf are quite capable of doing business with Israel without a formal relationship,” Freeman, the retired career diplomat who served as ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1990 to 1992, told me. But formalizing those ties would be immensely risky, with Saudi anger and dissatisfaction, possibly fomenting “a political convulsion” in protest, perhaps even “a revolution in Saudi Arabia,” according to Freeman. When it comes to Israel and Saudi Arabia, Sullivan has said that “ultimately getting to full normalization is a declared national security interest of the United States, we have been clear about that.” Blinken has said that Israel’s integration into the Arab Middle East would serve US interests and bring stability to the region.Some experts disagree on this point. Harvard political scientist Stephen Walt argues that the deal would only serve Israel’s interests. Such an accord “would symbolize ... the ability of Israel to enjoy normal relations with neighboring states despite continuing its occupation and never resolving the Palestinian conflict,” former intelligence officer Paul Pillar writes. “The sole beneficiary of such symbolism is the right-wing government of Israel.”China’s rising power in the world and its increasing influence in the Middle East may be a core reason for pursuing this deal. Biden’s entire approach to international security is focused on countering China, and that may be behind the impetus for formalizing relations and lining up two of the US’s most important Middle East partners. China recently worked to secure a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Biden administration may be prioritizing Israel-Saudi negotiations as a way for the US to reassert itself in the Middle East. The economic aspect of the normalization push cannot be overstated. While Saudi Arabia and the US have a robust relationship — in the current credit crunch moment, the kingdom’s reach in Silicon Valley continues to expand, for example — the alignment of Chinese and Saudi interests, however, could affect the US economy. China has made economic inroads in the kingdom: It has sought to buy Saudi oil with its own currency, and thereby degrade the might of the US dollar. The Biden administration may also want to vindicate the about-face of the president’s 2022 visit to Saudi Arabia after so strongly condemning MBS, says Dalia Dassa Kaye of UCLA’s Burkle Center for International Relations. “This normalization push really seems like a sideshow compared to global crises that we’re dealing with right now,” she told me. “They think it can really shake things up, and they could get some wins in a region that hasn’t given them any wins, if any, or very limited ones.”And then there is the reality of bureaucratic inertia, that the Trump policy of normalization instead of advancing policies that secure Palestinian rights, seems ascendent. As Palestinian journalist Said Arikat noted in a recent press briefing, the State Department has an envoy for the normalization effort but not for Israel-Palestinian negotiations, a divergence from previous administrations which came in with more aspirational peace plans. In hindsight, the US-led Middle East peace process of the past three decades was hardly set for success and contained many flawed assumptions that reinforced Israel’s asymmetric power over Palestinians. Still, that process gave the US some leverage in the Middle East that it now misses. And finally, the Biden administration perceives that clenching an Israel-Saudi deal would give it a major boost on the campaign trail. The US-led effort “has virtually nothing to do with foreign policy and everything to do with the presidential election,” says Freeman. Such a deal may alienate some progressive and left-wing voters in the Democratic camp, but it may also attract voters from the center and the right. Several analysts have argued that it would shore up donors for the Biden reelection campaign. Others note that, on the whole, Americans don’t tend to cast votes in response to foreign policy issues.Left unsaid, according to Freeman, is that “the Saudis have absolutely no reason to do anything to help Biden get reelected.” That, combined with the internal political situations in Israel and Saudi Arabia, makes this deal particularly unlikely. Yet even in these circumstances, there are already two clear winners. Netanyahu, who is facing a corruption investigation and ongoing weekly mass protests against his extreme government’s policies, comes away looking reasonable. And MBS, in essence, has been further welcomed back into the establishment fold. “MBS benefits from this dynamic,” Khalid Aljabri, a Saudi physician and political analyst based in Washington, DC, told me. “Because when you have a US administration that has a Middle East foreign policy that is singularly focused on normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, it means that MBS can get away with everything else he does. “MBS, for even the most minimal and minuscule gestures, is able to get maximal US concessions,” says Aljabri. “He has the Biden admin exactly where he wants them to be.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Milo Yiannopoulos’s collapse shows that no-platforming can work,2018-12-05,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:The former conservative media star is broke, saddled with as much as $4 million in debt. There’s a reason for that.Milo Yiannopoulos is broke.The provocateur, once one of the most prominent far-right voices in the country, lost his access to major conservative platforms in early 2017 after some comments that seemed to endorse pedophilia came to light. Without access to major publications and speaking engagements, he has entered a financial tailspin. Documents obtained by the Guardian showed that he was more than $2 million in debt as of October, $1.6 million of which was (inexplicably) owed to his own company. Yiannopoulos confirmed his insolvency in a statement on his Facebook page, which includes pictures of him sipping a cocktail while wearing a T-shirt with the words “Broke Hoe” in big, bold letters.“I was shocked to read more lies in the press about me today. They say I owe $2m. I don’t! It’s at least $4m. Do you know how successful you have to be to owe that kind of money?” he writes in the Facebook post.Yiannopoulos openly concedes that his desperate financial situation — and that’s what this is, braggadocio aside — is the result of the concerted campaign against him by his opponents. “I am pretty broke, relatively speaking,” he says. “Two years of being no-platformed, banned, blacklisted and censored...has taken its toll.”What this episode shows is that under the right circumstances, the controversial no-platforming tactics — which range from activists noisily disrupting speeches to big tech corporations banning provocateurs from their platforms — really can work. There’s no evidence that Yiannopoulos’s no-platforming led to his ideas and personality gaining a kind of underground popularity, as some free speech advocates believe happens when speech is repressed. Instead, they simply went six feet under.But before Milo’s critics celebrate too much, they should be aware of the flip side to all this: The same tactics that can be used to repress awful speech can be used against speech that’s just unpopular or threatening to people in power. Today, no-platforming may shut down speech you don’t like. Tomorrow, it might threaten speech you do. Now, that’s not to say no-platforming is an entirely illegitimate tactic. I think at times it’s justified against particularly vile speakers, and Yiannopoulos arguably fits the bill. It’s just that anyone who’s thinking about launching a no-platforming campaign needs to reckon with the inherent risks.You might think that Yiannopoulos’s flameout is an exception to the general rule of what happens to a no-platforming target. Part of his shtick was being ostentatious, flashing expensive jewelry and wearing absurd outfits. He was probably uniquely vulnerable to being cut off from the organized conservative movement and high-profile speaking engagements.But he’s not the only noxious figure on the fringe right to suffer as a result of being no-platformed.In August, key social media platforms — Facebook, YouTube, and Apple News — banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his factually challenged site Infowars. Jones claimed after the banning that it would only make him more popular, that “the more I’m persecuted, the stronger I get.”But a New York Times investigation published in September showed that this wasn’t actually true: In the three weeks following the ban, the average views of Infowars and Alex Jones videos examined by the Times fell by half. Two days after the Times published its investigation, Twitter permanently banned Jones from its platform, likely leading to an even steeper decline in access to his content.This cutoff really threatens Jones’s bottom line. His profit model centers on selling medically dubious supplements to a mass audience, a lucrative business that brought in around $20 million in revenue in 2014 (the last year for which figures are readily available). If Jones is getting fewer people to buy into his worldview, he’ll have difficulty maintaining a mass audience for Infowars supplements. And the Yiannopoulos-Jones story is typical, not the exception. Joan Donovan, a researcher at the Data & Society think tank who studies no-platforming, told Vice that her research finds consistent drop-offs in audiences after personalities are kicked off of social media platforms.“Generally,” she explained, “the falloff is pretty significant and they don’t gain the same amplification power they had prior to the moment they were taken off these bigger platforms.”There’s a reason far-right, anti-Muslim “journalist” Laura Loomer chained herself to Twitter’s Manhattan office doors last week to protest her ban from the service: It could very well lead to the end of her always-tenuous relevance.But anti-racist activists aren’t the only people who can mount pressure campaigns against social media giants and university administrations that can veto speaking engagements. The right has a long and storied history of enforcing its own version of political correctness. According to one study, between 2015 and 2017, more professors were fired for left-wing political speech that offended someone than speech with a right-wing valence.Just last week, CNN contributor and Temple University professor Marc Lamont Hill got in trouble for comments about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that he made in a speech at the United Nations. The flashpoint was his call for “a free Palestine from the river to the sea,” an old Palestinian Liberation Organization slogan that’s typically understood as a call for the destruction of Israel.Hill later clarified that he did not intend to justify killing Israeli Jews or to call for the forcible overthrow of the Israeli government, but the damage was done. Right-wing pro-Israel groups, alongside mainstream Jewish advocacy organizations like the Anti-Defamation League, condemned the comments almost immediately. Within 24 hours of the news breaking, CNN had fired Hill. And the controversy didn’t end. This Monday, the chair of Temple University’s board denounced Hill, telling Philly.com that “free speech is one thing. Hate speech is entirely different,” adding, “We’re going to look at what remedies we have.” That’s one lost job for Hill already, and another potentially in jeopardy. The whole episode is strikingly similar to what happened to Yiannopoulos — some comments emerge that offend a large group of people, and a public figure’s access to major media platforms is in jeopardy or cut off.Hill’s comments clearly aren’t as offensive as seemingly endorsing pedophilia, but there’s a debate as to just how bad they are. As a Jew with fairly left-wing views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it’s definitely not language I’m comfortable with. It really does echo calls for genocidal violence, and Hill should have been aware of that.But it’s clear, at the same time, that Hill is not an equivalent figure to Yiannopoulos or Jones, who is famous principally for spreading hate speech and false conspiracy theories. Hill’s academic work has mostly focused on hip-hop and racism in the US, though he’s also done some research and advocacy on Palestine. Yet he’s now at risk of facing a similar fate as those two provocateurs, being locked out of mainstream media and cut off from key sources of personal revenue.Pressure campaigns really are effective at shutting down offensive speech. But no one has a monopoly on being offended — which means the more these campaigns spread, the more likely they are to curtail speech from people you agree with.Again, that’s not to say no-platforming is never justified. I think Alex Jones’s ban from social media was a particularly clear case when removing a platform is a justified response. There’s no good way to stop the spread of fake news once it starts, and Jones’s entire raison d’être is spreading hateful conspiracy theories. Tech companies needed to draw the line somewhere, and it looks like Jones and Infowars were it.But it’s not always that clear-cut. And the sheer power of no-platforming, the demonstrable ability to ruin media figures’ careers and thus have a chilling effect on controversial speech, suggests it should be used with caution.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
This Gaza war didn’t come out of nowhere,2023-10-07,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Everyone forgot about the Palestinians — conditions have been set for two decades, and Biden’s focus on Israel-Saudi talks may have lit a match.It took Hamas’s deadly attack today to remind Israel, the United States, and the world that Palestine still matters.The militant group based in occupied Gaza launched aerial attacks and broke through the heavily secured fence into the State of Israel. Hundreds of Israelis have been killed, a historic scale of violence for the country. The Israeli counterattack will inevitably lead to more death and destruction for Palestinians and a tightened occupation.[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]It comes after nearly two decades of the US and world leaders overlooking the more than 2 million people living in Gaza who endure a humanitarian nightmare, with its airspace and borders and sea under Israeli control. The attack comes amid an ongoing failure to grapple with the dangerous situation for Palestinians in the West Bank where Israel’s extreme-right government over the past year has escalated the already brutal daily pain of occupation. Instances of Israeli security forces and Israeli settlers antagonizing Palestinians through violence are on the rise, from the pogrom on the city of Huwara to a new tempo of lethal raids on Jenin. Israeli government ministers have been pursuing annexationist policies and sharing raging rhetoric; both incite further violent response from Palestinians and appear at a time when new militant groups have emerged that claim the mantle of the Palestinian cause. The now-regular presence of Israeli Jews praying at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest sites, have further pressurized the situation. A Hamas commander cited many of these factors in his statement. Tell us by filling out this form. We’ll try to answer your questions in an upcoming story.But the ongoing reality of the occupation has not featured prominently in US or Arab leaders’ engagement with the region in recent years, even as circumstances for Palestinians worsened.The question must thus be asked to the Israeli government, the Biden administration, and Arab leaders: How did they forget about Palestinians? How did they so brazenly ignore Gaza?President Joe Biden has not reversed his predecessor Donald Trump’s policy of putting aside the question of Palestine and instead has exerted immense capital on the normalization of Israel’s relations with Arab states, no matter how extreme the policies of the Israeli government. In the current US-led diplomatic equation, there is no space for Palestinians, except for talk of minor concessions to ease daily humiliations. Biden said recently, as many of his surrogates often do, that the US remains intent on “preserving the path to a negotiated two-state solution.” But negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization have been frozen since 2014 under President Barack Obama, and most Palestinian analysts at this point acknowledge that US administrations since President Bill Clinton have engaged in a failed, asymmetrical process that never would have allowed for the conditions of an independent, sovereign state of Palestine. And so the symbolism of Hamas breaking through Israeli security barriers and wreaking havoc on Israel — including the kidnapping of at least one Israeli soldier as well as civilians — will resonate across Palestine, the Arab world, and beyond. Israel’s conflicts with Hamas, along with the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel conflict, have largely been rocket and artillery exchanges. Even in decades of large-scale Arab-Israeli wars, the battles were fought outside. “No Arab army has entered the territory of Israel since the 1948 war,” the preeminent Palestinian scholar Rashid Khalidi of Columbia University told me. “This is a huge strategic surprise.”[Related: What a “complete siege” of Gaza will mean for Palestinians]Israel and the United States have wished away Palestinians. The terrible bloodshed of today’s attacks underscores the cost of doing so.I’ve been to several Mideast policy conferences this month and spend probably too much of my time interviewing Washington experts and attending lectures on Middle East history. Palestinians are hardly represented in panels and keynotes. The Biden administration’s key players bring up Palestine as a secondary issue. Gaza does not come up anymore. But it remains central to how Palestinians and Arabs see Israel-Palestine and the Middle East — and how many Arabs perceive the US role in the world. Trump exacerbated the hopelessness for Palestinian political rights by cutting the Palestinians entirely out of the process, and instead helped seal normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco. But the autocratic Arab leaders who made “peace” with Israel never represented their own citizens.With Biden’s Middle East team prioritizing a long-shot deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, Biden’s inner circle has avoided talking about Gaza entirely. It’s all the more surprising because the two-week war between Israel and Hamas in May 2021 should have been an indication of Palestine’s enduring centrality to Middle East affairs. But as far as I can tell, there has been no policy reckoning in Washington about that war. No policy reviews.There was complacency. “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,” Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said only last week.It’s not even the first time that someone like Sullivan, who also served as a senior official in the Obama administration, has worked with his Egyptian counterparts to negotiate an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, as he is likely doing now. But now it’s clear that he and others treated Gaza peacemaking as a sideshow. It is not integral to Biden’s approach.The humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which Hamas administers some level of control over, remains as acute as ever. But because the US has long designated Hamas, the Palestinian militant political group with an Islamist worldview, as a terrorist organization, US officials can’t contact them and must work through third countries. It means that the US knowledge base and expertise on Gaza is not just low — it’s absent. The Palestine Liberation Organization’s leadership, with Chair Mahmoud Abbas still hanging on at 87 years old, lacks legitimacy among Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority, the body that exercises some administrative control over the occupied West Bank and that Abbas also runs, is seen by Palestinians as a collaboration arm of the Israeli occupation. A grassroots movement of Palestinian youth who engage in violent resistance against the Israeli security state, against settlers, and against civilians has emerged.Between the radical Israeli government and the sclerotic Palestinian leadership, the Biden administration chose to continue the path of Trump’s normalization deals, with Saudi Arabia as the prize. Biden’s team still states an allegiance to the pursuit of a Palestinian state while doing little more, all of which exposes the emptiness of the two-state solution. Early on Saturday, Hamas sent bulldozers through the barriers that have hemmed in Palestinians in Gaza from Israel and the rest of the world. That image of resistance to the occupation will be widely circulated in the Arab world, and will endure long beyond this war. Its symbolic power cannot be underestimated.Gaza is in essence a refugee camp (about 70 percent of those living in Gaza come from families displaced from the 1948 war) and an open-air prison, according to human rights groups. The United Nations describes the occupied territory as a “chronic humanitarian crisis.” Israel has blockaded Gaza since Hamas assumed control of the territory in 2007, and neighboring Egypt to the south has also imposed severe restrictions on movement. Between them, Israel and Egypt monitor the entry and exit of all people, vehicles, and goods. They have not allowed enough construction materials and humanitarian items into the occupied Gaza Strip to enable the battered territory to rebuild from recurring episodes of deadly Israeli bombardments that are allegedly meant to target Hamas, but that often include civilian death tolls in the very dense territory.The current Israeli government has aggravated these realities, Khalidi explained, by increasing pressure on the Palestinians on multiple fronts: in Jerusalem, squeezing Gaza, assaults on Palestinian villages by settlers, with settler-politicians leading ministries in the Israeli government; and with annexationist policies like the recent major policy change putting the Israeli civilian government (not the Israeli military) in charge of the occupied West Bank. Hamas’s attacks on Israel won’t change life for Palestinians, and Israel’s government will now use the full force of its advanced military in response. And given Israel’s state of emergency, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now in talks with the opposition parties to pull together a unity government for the country. But even if some of the most extreme settler voices currently in the Israeli cabinet are replaced by more mainstream Israeli voices, harsh policies against Palestinians across the West Bank and Gaza will continue.  [Related: Benjamin Netanyahu failed Israel]“This pressure being put on Palestinians — it just assumes that they’re insignificant and they will tolerate any degree of humiliation, and that’s just not true,” Khalidi told me. “If you had lifted the siege of Gaza, you would not have had this happen.”Now Israelis are experiencing terrible loss and a tremendous sense of danger, and Palestinians living in Gaza will endure more violence, including Israeli troops entering the territories and the extensive bombardment of alleged military sites that typically have a significant civilian toll.Global powers have been ignoring Gaza, but some in Israel haven’t forgotten. “The dread Israelis are feeling right now, myself included, is a sliver of what Palestinians have been feeling on a daily basis under the decades-long military regime in the West Bank, and under the siege and repeated assaults on Gaza,” writes the Israeli journalist Haggai Mattar in 972 Magazine. “The only solution, as it has always been, is to bring an end of apartheid, occupation, and siege, and promote a future based on justice and equality for all of us. It is not in spite of the horror that we have to change course — it is exactly because of it.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine,2018-11-20,Vox,['Susannah Locke'],
The Biden administration needs to update its old thinking on Israel-Palestine,2023-10-27,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:A viral essay by Biden’s foreign policy adviser shows why the US needs to rethink its strategy when it comes to Israel and Gaza.On September 29, at a festival put on by the Atlantic, Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan boasted of the Middle East’s unprecedented stability. Just a week later, Hamas attacked Israel, and far from being stable, the Middle East hasn’t been this volatile in years.It’s not quite fair to hold someone to a turn of phrase on a conference panel, but it turns out that Sullivan wasn’t speaking off the cuff. That sentiment encapsulated how the Biden administration’s key thinker sees the state of the world — or, at least, how he saw it. The sentiment also appears in the print version of Sullivan’s November/December cover story for Foreign Affairs magazine. Overtaken by events would be a generous way to put this.“The Middle East is quieter than it has been for decades,” he wrote in an essay that went to print before Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel. Sullivan deleted that passage from the web edition of the article and updated the Middle East portions of the piece. “We are working closely with regional partners to facilitate the sustainable delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in the Gaza Strip,” Sullivan writes in the online version. “We are alert to the risk that the current crisis could spiral into a regional conflict.”But the print edition of the magazine arrived on doorsteps this week and is now a striking artifact of Biden’s pre-October 7 priorities. And while it would be easy to dunk on some of the now out-of-date passages from Sullivan, which demonstrated how the Biden administration totally missed the possibility of a new Hamas-Israel war, what’s more interesting is how little these events have seemed to change things for the administration. A read of the web version of his piece shows that the Hamas-Israel war has not fundamentally altered the national security adviser’s assumptions about the world. He remains focused on using unconventional economic tools, like investing in the US industrial base and using export controls to advance US statecraft, and stitching together new alliances to benefit American interests, all while being disciplined about how the US uses its military power. “Americans should be optimistic about the future,” he writes in both versions. “Old assumptions and structures must be adapted to meet the challenges the United States will face between now and 2050.” But what’s noteworthy is that the United States’ approach to the Middle East and Israel, according to Sullivan, is still not one of those areas that needs an update. Yet the Hamas-Israel war reveals both the limits of Biden’s current foreign policy and the need for new thinking. Even as the administration has prioritized countering China and Russia, the Middle East has pulled the White House back in. For Sullivan, the Biden administration’s approach “frees up resources for other global priorities, reduces the risk of new Middle Eastern conflicts, and ensures that U.S. interests are protected on a far more sustainable basis.” But the US has sent two aircraft carrier groups to the Middle East, militants are attacking US military bases in Iraq and Syria, and a severe humanitarian crisis is spiraling in Gaza, all as the potential for a larger regional war looms. The unconventional diplomatic tools Sullivan touts in other contexts don’t always apply well to Israel: The country’s economic partnerships with Arab states, for example, are not coming in handy.Biden paid a political price for the Afghanistan withdrawal, and Sullivan stands by the decision to “avoid protracted forever wars ... that do little to actually reduce the threats to the U.S.” But that instinct doesn’t seem sufficiently present here. The administration backs Israel in a war that — for all the US’s pushing for Israel to define its goals — has no clear outcome and that will wear away US credibility in the world. The administration has shown an old instinct to call for a two-state solution without an investment in policies that would lead there. The last three weeks have shown that the assumption that the Middle East is stable is simply wrong — no one could deny that. But what policymakers should realize is that the old Middle East toolkit of managing conflicts without addressing their root causes does not apply. And on that measure, at least, the Biden administration is not ready to offer a correction.Sullivan in the essay focuses on the Biden administration’s big themes: countering China (and to a lesser extent Russia), prioritizing industrial policy, reinvigorating alliances and multilateral partnerships, and tackling global development issues like health and the environment, with signposts on how the US will prioritize these and other competing challenges.“By investing in the sources of domestic strength, deepening alliances and partnerships, delivering results on global challenges, and staying disciplined in the exercise of power, the United States will be prepared to advance its vision of a free, open, prosperous, and secure world no matter what surprises are in store,” Sullivan writes. “We have created, in Secretary of State Dean Acheson’s words, ‘situations of strength.’”What makes the essay noteworthy is not just the content, but the author. The national security adviser has gotten more powerful in each subsequent presidency, and Sullivan is the zenith of that trend. He’s considered the architect of the administration’s foreign policy, as profile after profile has portrayed him.It’s also rare for a sitting national security adviser to write at such length for readers. And it’s different from a speech, which Sullivan has delivered at many a think tank and which often serves as an announcement of a new policy; it’s also less technical or in-depth than an academic publication or a policy memo. You might call it a vibes piece, not with actionable foreign policy advice but rather an ideological blueprint for the Biden administration’s worldview. The main focus is on economic statecraft and alliance-building aimed at pushing back against China, with the Middle East component coming much later on in the article.What’s interesting is that a war between Israel and Hamas doesn’t alter Jake Sullivan’s fundamental reasoning: The Middle East still falls under the heading of “Pick Your Battles.” That doesn’t seem feasible, nor does it seem to reflect what the administration has done since October 7. The last three weeks have drawn the US in, given Washington’s longtime role as Israel’s security guarantor. The administration’s Middle East approach “emphasizes deterring aggression, de-escalating conflicts, and integrating the region through joint infrastructure projects and new partnerships, including between Israel and its Arab neighbors,” Sullivan wrote in the original version of the essay. “And it is bearing fruit,” bringing up the example of a “new economic corridor” announced in September that would ultimately connect India to Europe, through the Middle East. The web update changed “bearing fruit” to, “There was material progress,” and cited the relative calm in Yemen’s war. The rest of the text stayed the same.A lot of lines were cut, like “we have de-escalated crises in Gaza,” referencing the May 2021 conflict there, and “restored direct diplomacy between the parties after years of its absence.” (Israel and the PLO held talks in March, which didn’t go anywhere, and this month the two parties are not talking.)Biden’s team has only put limited attention to Israel-Palestine in the past two and a half years. When Israel and Hamas fought in May 2021, Sullivan worked with regional partners to negotiate a ceasefire in 10 days. That event does not majorly figure into how the administration sees the Middle East. It seems to have confirmed priors, reinforcing the now-shattered idea that the conflict is manageable.

  Palestine has not been a central component of Middle East policy. President Donald Trump shunted aside Palestinians in favor of Israel-Arab normalization deals, and the Biden administration has continued that policy. In July 2022, the White House released a fact sheet on the “United States-Palestinian Relationship” that focused on economic initiatives without a larger strategy for addressing the root causes of the conflict. As a senior administration official told journalists that month, “[W]e are not going to come in with a top-down peace plan, because we don’t believe that that would be the best approach and it would set expectations that would probably fall flat.” Ever since, the administration sought a deal that would normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Sullivan does not mention the path toward a Palestinian state in the original essay, but instead emphasizes “integrating the region” through normalization. It’s why the obscure I2U2 partnership (between India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the US) merits a mention, an example that shows how the administration was continuing the Trump policy of pursuing a stability in the region that overlooked Palestinians. That approach has now proved to be unsustainable and even incendiary. And those policies will be increasingly difficult as the Israeli military campaign continues. The essay has now been updated to say, “We are committed to a two-state solution. In fact, our discussions with Saudi Arabia and Israel toward normalization have always included significant proposals for the Palestinians. If agreed, this component would ensure that a path to two states remains viable, with significant and concrete steps taken in that direction by all relevant parties.”But there are not strong indications that US leadership can secure an independent, sovereign Palestinian state. It hasn’t been a priority in the past two and a half years, nor is it now a priority for the near or even medium term.Above all else, and beyond the behind-the-scenes efforts Biden has undertaken to slow a ground invasion of Gaza, the administration stands with Israel. Biden is asking Congress for $14 billion of military aid to the country. US officials have reportedly helped delay a ground incursion into Gaza and marshaled a small supply of humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza. But the Biden administration has not called for a Mideast ceasefire and vetoed a United Nations resolution with softened language on this. But the situation is so dire — the Israeli military campaign continues — that it’s surprising that the Biden administration sees its policies as durable and its framework as working. The Biden administration’s Middle East mantra, as both versions of the essay conclude, is, “We have to advance regional integration in the Middle East while continuing to check Iran.” That is, Biden is doubling down on Israel normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia without acknowledging how much has changed in the world. The Hamas-Israel war led the Saudi crown prince and the Iranian president to talk on the phone for the first time since they began a China-led rapprochement. We haven’t yet seen such a course correction from Biden. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Jake Sullivan was leading White House efforts to write the National Security Strategy. That document guides US policy broadly, and officials delayed publication and rewrote it to stress the threat of Russia alongside the marquee issue of China.The Biden administration remains focused on that superpower conflict. “The crisis in the Middle East does not change the fact that the United States needs to prepare for a new era of strategic competition—in particular by deterring and responding to great-power aggression,” writes Sullivan in the article. He also discusses China with measured language that reflects the administration’s attempts to break with the Trump administration’s heated China rhetoric while still maintaining some of its hawkish approaches.Ali Wyne, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, agrees that the Middle East war does not fundamentally affect what the US should focus on today. “Instability in the Middle East and Europe does not invalidate the judgment that the Indo-Pacific’s economic and military centrality in world affairs is poised to grow apace,” he wrote in an email.The trickier part from a policy perspective is the role of the US military in the world. Sullivan acknowledges that “Washington could no longer afford an undisciplined approach to the use of military force.” Sullivan says the administration seeks to dodge the trap of “protracted forever wars that can tie down US forces and that do little to actually reduce the threats to the United States,” and cites the withdrawal from Afghanistan. But explaining this, Sullivan doesn’t engage with the relatively small but seemingly permanent US troop presence in places like Iraq and Syria, among others. Those US servicemembers are coming under more and more militant attacks and could draw the US even further into Middle East war.Sullivan argues in the essay that the US has entered a whole new era and that means that the United States has to make significant adjustments. “And yet, much of his prescription looks a lot like inertia,” Stephen Wertheim of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told me. “None of this is really argued in a way that would give a reader confidence that the US government has a plan to keep costs and risks under control.”While Sullivan acknowledges in his writing that America’s resources are limited and difficult choices will need to be made, he does not address the trade-offs or how to think about them. A US aircraft carrier — like the two Biden deployed to the waters near Israel in the weeks after Hamas’s attack, out of 11 — can only be in one place at once.The potential of a long-term entanglement in a new Middle East war imperils Biden’s priorities. It could take not just manpower, but resources and attention away from countering China — which is “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge,” according to the National Security Strategy. Yet the Biden administration acknowledges, “As we implement this strategy, we will continually assess and reassess our approach to ensure we are best serving the American people.” Now is one of those moments to assess whether this is all working.A wholesale reassessment of the US relationship with Israel, its closest Middle East ally and a stalwart defense partner, would be unlikely. Hamas is holding Americans and dual citizens hostage, and a wider war would hurt the US’s Middle East partners. The US sees the partnership with Israel based on shared values and cultural connections. American support of Israel is an unquestioned tenet of bipartisan foreign policy.But that partnership carries risks, too — and not just ones related to this outbreak of violence. “Much of the world sees the United States actively assisting the government of Israel in dispossessing and occupying Palestinian land,” Wertheim told me. Sullivan doesn’t grapple with what that means for US prestige and power in the world that many observers see the US as complicit if not a participant in Israel’s Gaza war, even as the Israeli goals remain undefined.The essay from Sullivan contrasts that of his former Obama administration colleague Ben Rhodes. Writing in the New York Review of Books, Rhodes cautions that if Israel further escalates its military campaign in Gaza, it risks “igniting a war of undetermined length, cost, and consequences.” Rhodes says there is a need for “genuinely pursuing an Israeli–Palestinian peace as the end of this war.”That would require intensive US leadership.The cover of the issue is a frayed and fragmented American flag above Sullivan’s name and the headline “The Sources of American Power.” Previously, that image may have signaled the coming together of the US after the cleavages of the Trump years and the toll it took on American influence in the world. Now, the flag suggests the US is coming apart, unable to calm a Middle East at war and facing internal cracks as it grapples with the threats of Russia and China.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Israel and the UAE just struck a historic peace deal. It’s a big win for Trump.,2020-08-13,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:A lot of details remain to be worked out, but this is still a really big agreement.Israel and the United Arab Emirates just agreed to a historic deal to normalize their long-strained relations — and it may not have happened without the input of President Donald Trump’s administration.In a surprise announcement Thursday, the US, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates put out a  joint statement outlining how the two Middle Eastern nations will develop ties in numerous areas including investment, security, tourism, technology, and energy, and will establish formal embassies in each other’s countries. But at the heart of the agreement is a trade: As the statement lays out, Israel will “suspend declaring sovereignty over” parts of the West Bank that it had previously expressed intentions to annex. In exchange, the UAE will treat Israel as it would any other country it has friendly relations with — making it only the third Arab country to have such open relations with Jerusalem.“This historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to the bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region,” the statement reads.Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and UAE leader Mohammed Bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, finalized the terms of the agreement — to be known as the “Abraham Accords” in a nod to the patriarch of both the Jewish and Muslim faiths — during a Thursday phone call. Trump also hinted in the Oval Office that more “things are happening,” while Netanyahu tweeted in Hebrew that Thursday is “A historic day.”The announcement was sudden, so everyone will learn more about it and its implications down the line. But for now, two main reasons stick out for why this is such a big deal.First, it means Israel won’t — at least for now — annex parts of the West Bank, a move that would have all but shut the door on a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians. The Israeli-occupied West Bank is home to nearly 3 million Palestinians as well some 500,000 Jewish settlers, and would form a critical part of any future independent state of Palestine. As my colleague Jen Kirby explained:Under the two-state framework historically supported by the United States and the international community, the vast bulk of the West Bank would be returned to the Palestinians. As part of a final peace deal, Israelis and Palestinians would negotiate what to do about the settlements, with some heavily populated blocs near Israel’s recognized borders likely to be ceded to Israel. But peace talks have stalled for years, and there is no deal anywhere on the horizon.Instead, the Israeli right has been pushing for Netanyahu’s government to just go ahead and unilaterally annex significant portions of the West Bank that it wants to keep, making them officially part of Israel proper, regardless of what the Palestinians think about it.In January, the Trump administration unveiled its “peace plan,” developed by US and Israeli officials without the input of Palestinian leaders, who refused to participate. The plan helped create the conditions for Netanyahu to move forward with unilateral annexation, and for months, it looked as though Netanyahu was going to do it. In fact, it was supposed to officially happen as soon as July 1.But it didn’t.Now we know the likely reason for the stalled annexation: Trump and his team aimed to strike a deal to convince Netanyahu otherwise.However, some claim the Israeli leader needed a way to back out of such a controversial promise. “Bibi climbs down from a tree it never seemed like he really wanted to be in,” Yair Rosenberg, a writer at the Jewish news-focused Tablet Magazine, tweeted after the deal’s revelation. Even if that is right, getting the UAE to normalize ties with the country is a pretty good way to get out of a corner.Second, this makes life a bit easier for Israel. The last peace deal it struck with an Arab country was with Jordan in 1994 (it signed one with Egypt in 1979). Now Israel can claim it has more friends in the region, possibly reducing the pressure on it regarding its relations with Palestinians. Granted, both nations had quietly been working together in myriad areas, namely technology, for several years. But now, the countries can openly work together in key areas, mostly pressingly on a cure for the coronavirus.Indeed, Thursday’s joint statement said both countries would now accelerate their cooperation in search of a treatment and a vaccine. That’s a marked shift from just two months ago when Netanyahu announced a coronavirus partnership with the UAE, only to have the Arab country a few hours later say the only ties were between companies from both nations, not their governments. This agreement may help the UAE do business with Israel, which in turn should help the Arab nation’s economy. Put together, this deal is mostly a win-win for the UAE: It helps itself, and reduces the risk of a calamity happening in the region.Many caveats still apply, though. Among other possibilities, Israel and the UAE could hit many snags as they work on how, exactly, to normalize relations. Netanyahu will likely face anger from the Israeli far right, particularly the thousands of Israeli settlers in the West Bank who hoped Netanyahu would follow through on his annexation promise. “We were tricked,” Shai Alon, head of the pro-settler Beit El Regional Council, said in a statement Thursday. “We’ve been betrayed.”Palestinian leaders, too, have expressed outrage over the agreement. “Israel got rewarded for not declaring openly what it’s been doing to Palestine illegally & persistently since the beginning of the occupation,” tweeted Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the official national representative of the Palestinian people. “The UAE has come out in the open on its secret dealings/normalization with Israel. Please don’t do us a favor. We are nobody’s fig leaf!”Still, some experts are cautiously optimistic. “The UAE-Israel announcement is good news, and breaks an important barrier,” Dan Shapiro, who served as US ambassador to Israel under President Barack Obama, told me. Two long-estranged nations have agreed to be openly friendly with each other, and the US helped — giving Trump one of his biggest foreign policy victories as the election draws near.

"After the latest clash with Israel, Gazans’ struggle continues",2022-08-14,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:The killing of militant leaders sparked clashes that, for now, have ended in a shaky ceasefire.Battles between the Israeli military and the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) killed 49 Palestinians in the last week in Gaza, the territory where Palestinians live under often brutal conditions and repeated outbreaks of deadly violence.Israeli forces launched a preemptive strike against PIJ targets on August 5, Reuters reported, after one of the group’s leaders, Bassam al-Saadi, was arrested in the Occupied West Bank. Israel claims to have hit a number of PIJ targets. However, several civilians, including 17 children, were killed in the clashes, both by Israeli weapons and possibly by errant PIJ rockets intended for Israeli targets. A ceasefire brokered by Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, the US, the UN, and the Palestinian Authority between Israel and the PIJ last Sunday has thus far held; however, an attack on worshipers in Jerusalem’s Old City late on Sunday could portend more violence. At least eight people, including US citizens, were injured in the attack, which was allegedly carried out by a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, according to Israeli authorities. They have not yet released his name, and there is no indication that he is affiliated with any larger group, according to Reuters. Despite the ceasefire, the aftermath of even short-term hostilities in Gaza goes far beyond active bombardments and shelling; the combination of years of violence, a brutal blockade, and state repression has created an enduring crisis. What’s more, there’s little chance to recover before violence breaks out again.According to initial UN reporting, 360 Palestinians have been injured in the fighting, and Gazans experienced a tightened Israeli blockade of goods and services that led to 20-plus-hour rolling blackouts each day. There were no Israeli deaths or serious injuries, the Associated Press reported Friday. While much smaller than Hamas, the PIJ, the militant Palestinian nationalist organization that controls Gaza, “is very efficient and highly organized,” according to Ibrahim Fraihat of the Doha Institute. “There is a strong order within the party itself,” he told Al Jazeera last week. “Despite its small size, it has participated in all the confrontations with Israel.” Hamas was not involved in the latest conflict, possibly due to economic agreements with Israel that have eased Israel and Egypt’s 15-year blockade on the territory.Founded in the late ’70s and early ’80s, the PIJ eschews negotiations with Israel, opting instead for armed struggle. Its goal is to create an Islamic Palestinian state that encompasses not only the occupied territories, but all of what is now Israel, according to the AP. Like Hamas, it’s designated a terrorist organization by many Western countries, including the US. However, unlike Hamas, it’s not part of the political leadership in Gaza or the West Bank, and makes no effort toward political activity within the occupied territories.  PIJ is also aligned with Iran, which contributed to Israel’s decision to launch preemptive strikes, Fraihat told Al Jazeera. During last week’s fighting, Israeli forces killed two of the group’s leaders, Taysir al-Jabari and Khalid Mansour. Al-Jabari was a member of the group’s military council, and commanded the group in Gaza City and northern Gaza during last year’s outbreak of violence, while Mansour was in charge of military operations in the southern Gaza strip, according to Axios. The AP reported that Israel claimed al-Jabari was preparing an anti-tank missile attack, prompting Israel’s preemptive aerial bombardments on August 5. PIJ fighters retaliated using a barrage of rockets — 1,100, according to the Israeli military, a tactic Hamas and other groups have developed knowing that the Iron Dome defense system will likely take out a great number of projectiles fired at people or infrastructure. Stakeholders pushed for a ceasefire to keep the violence from escalating further.Violence between the Israeli state and Palestinian groups is far from uncommon; in April 2021, Israeli police interrupted Ramadan services at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and then attempted to evict Palestinian families from the city’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. By May 10, that escalated into bombing campaigns on the part of the Israeli military and rocket attacks by Hamas and the PIJ that killed at least 250 Palestinians, including approximately 128 civilians, and 12 Israeli civilians. Prior to that, Israel had been in frequent conflict with neighboring states like Lebanon and Syria, as well as Palestinian groups in the occupied territories and diaspora. Israel’s caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, said in a speech August 8 that last weekend’s military operation had accomplished all of its goals and that “whoever tries to harm us will pay with their life,” warning against retaliation from PIJ or other groups. While he said that Israeli forces made ”special efforts” not to harm civilians, Israel “would not apologize for defending its people with force,” Haaretz reported. While attacks and retaliation from Gaza certainly affect Israeli civilians — forcing them into shelter, destroying property, and sometimes killing innocent people — there is a notable asymmetry not only in the kinds of weapons both sides use, but also in the effect they have on civilian areas, for a number of reasons. In Gaza, it’s incredibly difficult for people to rebuild their homes, not only due to military operations but because they cannot get the supplies to do so, as Diana Buttu, a Canadian Palestinian attorney and former advisor to Palestinian Authority President and Palestine Liberation Organization Chair Mahmoud Abbas, told Vox. “It’s been ongoing now for 15 years — this tough, tough blockade,” in which both goods and people cannot move freely, she said. Buttu said when she lived in Gaza in 2005, there were often bread rations, and “being able to get milk, fresh milk, was a huge, huge feat.” Over time, she noted, the blockade got progressively worse; items like cement and other building materials have been heavily restricted by the authorities since they are ostensibly dual-use materials, which can also be used for military purposes. “One of the biggest challenges is to just be able to do simple things, like to get supplies in to rebuild the buildings that have been bombed, including glass. Glass is a huge challenge for them,” she said. While some building materials were allowed into Gaza after sustained protest to lift the restrictions, Al Jazeera reported in May 2021, there are still buildings that were damaged in the 2008-2009 conflict that have not been entirely repaired, Buttu said. “For families in Gaza, they’re always living with a sense that, even after a building is bombed, that they don’t have the ability to rebuild it. Even if you’re trying to recover in some way, you’re still seeing all this rubble in your midst. It’s just a daily, constant reminder that you just went through a massive bombing campaign.”Gazans’ inability to rebuild their homes and businesses means that many are internally displaced, living in makeshift housing. At the height of last year’s conflict, more than 117,000 Gazans were displaced from their homes and 10,500 remained internally displaced at the end of the year, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. There’s also less likely to be a safe place to take shelter during aerial bombing campaigns.The blockade also means people have to negotiate access to medical equipment and access to care outside of Gaza, Buttu told Vox — even in dire situations. “There’s always these negotiations that end up happening between the Israelis and Palestinian hospitals, usually with the World Health Organization, or Physicians for Human Rights as the middle person,” she said. “It’s so dehumanizing that you have to actually negotiate with them, in terms of the quantities of stuff that can come in — what’s allowed in, what’s not allowed in. They’re living in a constant, 24-hour state of trauma, and there’s no way to get past it.”The Gaza strip is home to around 2 million Palestinians and has been governed by Hamas since 2007, when the group took control from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank. The two groups have had no success in creating a unity government over the past 15 years, despite repeated attempts, weakening the Palestinian resistance and further disenfranchising ordinary Palestinians. Although Fatah and Hamas agreed to hold elections in 2021, which would be the first since 2006, those elections have been postponed indefinitely. That’s on top of crushing restrictions imposed by the Israeli state. In addition to the blockade, the only Palestinians allowed to vote in Israeli elections are those who live within Israel’s borders as they were defined between 1948 and June 1967. There are also restrictions on Palestinians’ ability to move into Israel and between the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, as Human Rights Watch outlined in an April 2021 report. “People will resort to going to human rights organizations and NGOs to try to get some form of representation, but there’s no voice,” Buttu said. Gazans are also subject to high rates of unemployment — around 50 percent, even before the Covid-19 pandemic — and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, estimated that 80 percent of of the population depended on humanitarian assistance for basic necessities as of 2017. The blockade has contributed to issues like poor wastewater management in Gaza, with wastewater flowing into the Mediterranean Sea, making it unsafe for people to swim or seek respite from heat. Though a wastewater facility is now up and running, according to NPR, the facility is running out of spare parts and chemicals to make sure the wastewater is clean because Israeli authorities haven’t complied with the facility’s requests. “In two months from today, there will be no chemicals to test our quality,” Fahid Rabah, an engineer at the facility, told NPR in August. “We’ll be blind. We will not be able to know whether we are performing the environmental quality or not.”Given Palestinians’ — and particularly Gazans’ — extremely limited political power, access to basic goods and services, and the curtailment of basic freedoms, not to mention routine, devastating violence, it’s challenging to see any possibility for change, either in Gaza or for Palestinians overall. Peace talks between Israel and Palestine have repeatedly failed, Arab and Muslim states that had previously pledged solidarity with Palestine have normalized relationships with Israel, and the Israeli state has continued to push settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as lobby to have Jerusalem recognized as the nation’s capital by the US under the Trump administration. However, Buttu said, there are some reasons to be hopeful about the future for Palestinians. She pointed to the increasing political activity of Palestinian Israeli citizens and their push to maintain their identity in the face of discrimination and the drive to sublimate into the broader Israeli population. “The second area is that, in the West Bank and in Gaza, despite everything, despite occupation and siege, there isn’t a sense of ‘Let’s throw in the towel,’” Buttu said. “There’s a much more increased sense that there has to be pushback against Israel,” and against the old-guard Palestinian political parties like Fatah, she said. “They haven’t managed to break through, but there’s still that push there, there’s still that discourse that’s happening there ... there are people who are still pushing back and saying, ‘We’re not going to live like this.’”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The costs of Biden’s Middle East trip were not worth the paltry benefits,2022-07-19,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Biden failed to put human rights at the center of Middle East policy.The viral photo of President Joe Biden’s fist-bump with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud (MBS) didn’t just capture a remarkable turnaround for a president who’d vowed to make a “pariah” out of MBS.It also captured the stakes of the trip.There are huge gaps between what Biden set out as his goals for his trip last week to the Middle East and what he actually accomplished. He showed up to Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory, and Saudi Arabia with an agenda focused on countering the influence of China, Russia, and Iran in the Middle East. He said he wanted to strengthen strategic partnerships to make “a consequential region of the world” more stable. And while addressing high oil prices, in part stemming from the Ukraine war, wasn’t central to the stated goals, it was an ever-present subtext of this trip. Even on those metrics, the costs of the Middle East trip to American credibility were high, and not worth the paltry benefits to regional stability or US partnerships. If you step back to evaluate the trip on other metrics — particularly whether it promoted US values in the middle of what Biden has called a global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism — it was even worse. The Biden administration says it’s advancing a more connected region by redoubling relationships with nine Arab countries and showing support for an interim government in Israel fractured by its fifth set of elections in three years. What were the costs to America’s reputation, beyond the fist-bump? There was a handshake with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who presides over a vicious police state where thousands of prisoners are unjustly jailed. It’s worth recalling that initially Biden also sought to distance himself from Sisi, without any direct contact in the first months of his administration until Sisi’s help was needed in May 2021 to help deescalate the Israel-Hamas conflict. There was the family photo with Arab leaders, including the new ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Mohamed bin Zayed. MBZ also presides over a country of human rights violations, and the UAE arrested Jamal Khashoggi’s lawyer, Asim Ghafoor, during this trip. Yet MBZ received an invitation to the White House, and all of these leaders have their own souvenir postcard. Fist-bumping Israeli leaders without accountability for the killing of Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh by Israeli soldiers is just as bad as spudding with MBS. Biden on the trip said he’d “insist on a full and transparent accounting,” but it’s not clear why that insistence didn’t come prior to arriving in Israel as a way to build trust and confidence with a Palestine Liberation Organization that President Donald Trump had kneecapped. Then there was Biden at the lectern, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, who chastised the United States for not being tough enough on Iran and led Biden to say that he would use force against Iran, rhetoric that makes a war more likely (in spite of the administration’s best diplomats working to revive a nuclear deal). “This incredible inflated helium balloon of rhetoric about a struggle between democracy and autocracy, which was mobilized around Ukraine, I think, has been very much deflated,” said Rashid Khalidi, a historian at Columbia University. “Putin is an autocrat, but so is Sisi. The invasion of Ukraine and the occupation of Ukrainian territory is a violation of international law, but so is everything Israel is doing in the occupied territories.”The images of this visit will endure much longer than the minor tangible policy accomplishments that were announced, and aren’t that remarkable.Biden, who says he went to the Middle East to address “the needs of the free world,” has explained the strengthening of relationships with Arab states and Israel as a success.But it’s worth taking a look at what concrete victories that closeness produced. Saudi airspace will be opened to Israeli planes — an incremental step toward normalizing relations between the two countries, yes, but more of a victory for jetliner rights than human rights. A new peacekeeping arrangement was announced for the Red Sea Islands between Egypt and Saudi Arabia; the islands have been a regional geopolitical touchpoint, but the deal is hardly a major win beyond the region. There was talk of bringing Iraq closer to its neighbors, with a new electricity initiative to connect Iraq with the Middle East. Infrastructure projects totaling about $100 million were announced for Palestinians, including 4G networks for the occupied West Bank. The latter two, while worthwhile, are minor compared to other US development and foreign aid streams of funding — and minuscule compared to annual military aid to Israel.A moderate success was Saudi Arabia’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a ceasefire in Yemen, a worthy goal considering the destruction wrought there, in part with the support of American weaponry, though hardly an issue that demanded a presidential visit.As for oil, we haven’t seen any grand announcements. Ahead of the trip, a US official told reporters there wouldn’t be any big energy news, and instead pointed to an announcement a month prior from OPEC that the group of oil-producing nations would increase production. It has left observers wondering exactly why Biden made the journey. “Foreign policy is often a series of making a series of bad choices. And so you try to make the least bad one. To me, this wasn’t the least bad one,” Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations said of the trip. “Biden was always gonna need the Saudis. The problem was you foolishly put yourself in his position, and now you’re being forced to go, and with not a lot in return.”“Deal with the Saudis,” Cook added, “but don’t necessarily go. It only makes the president look weaker.”  For Chas Freeman, who served as ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1990 to 1992, the “quixotic” trip didn’t produce any great results. “What does it do for the middle class that is supposed to be the focus of the administration’s foreign policy,” Freeman told me. “Is there a coherent policy here? I don’t see one.”A senior Biden administration official, on the last day of Biden’s Middle East trip, described human rights at the center of America’s goals — “I’d go so far, literally, to say right at the forefront of our foreign policy,” they said. But human rights is not even at the forefront of the administration’s press releases, fact sheets, and meeting summaries. The official touted a “Biden doctrine” for the region. In the document, values rank lowest — fifth — after bullet points about partnerships, deterrence, diplomacy, and integration. So partnerships (with unsavory leaders) and deterrence (through our security assistance) are the priorities here.In each and every meeting recap, human rights did not come first. A joint statement on Biden’s meeting with Egypt’s Sisi put human rights second to last, after a series of bullet points about security and economic interests, and near the bottom of the joint statement put out with the king of Jordan. Human rights was not mentioned in the statement put out with the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. And according to readouts of Biden’s meetings with the leaders of Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain, human rights did not come up. The joint statement put out by the US and Gulf Cooperation Council countries — including Saudi Arabia and UAE — was primarily about security, and there was no mention of human rights. It’s a missed opportunity because Saudi Arabia is not alone in its human rights violations. The presidential bully pulpit is an important way to draw attention to the reality faced by Arab citizens, immigrants, and refugees.Biden assured journalists present that he had raised Khashoggi’s killing with MBS, “at the top of the meeting, making it clear what I thought of it at the time and what I think of it now.” (Saudi officials, after the visit, disputed this, while Biden reiterated he had.) MBS reportedly brought up the “mistakes” the US has made, with state-sponsored torture of Iraqi prisoners of Abu Ghraib and complicity in the death of Abu Akleh — an embarrassing deflection from someone Biden called a “pariah.”The White House may think it succeeded in raising these issues — a senior administration official told reporters in that same briefing that the president needed to be willing to be present and “sit and raise human rights concerns with foreign leaders around the world.” But Arab media’s coverage of the event frames it more as a capitulation. “Diplomatically, it is an embarrassment,” said Nancy Okail, an Egyptian human rights advocate and executive director of the Center for International Policy. “Because the way it’s being spun in the Middle East media is that he came to us, he knelt down.” Critics say there are concrete things Biden could have done to advance human rights in the region, even if he was meeting with leaders.He could have, for instance, preconditioned his visit on a prisoner release or have met with Saudi activists like Loujain al-Hathloul, who was jailed and tortured, and remains banned from leaving Saudi Arabia. He could have broadened his public comments to include MBS’s unprecedented clampdown on rights or arranged a roundtable with Arab journalists. Months before traveling to Israel, he could have drawn attention to the government’s decision to label six leading Palestinian human rights groups as terrorist groups. Nine European governments last week condemned the designation and said that the Israeli government has not provided evidence to prove their terrorist connection. The State Department draws upon these groups’ research for its annual human rights reports, “Yet the Biden administration would not say anything,” said Michael Sfard, an Israeli attorney who represents the Palestinian group Al-Haq, which Israel called a terrorist group. “And that is very, very disturbing.”Biden hardly mentioned human rights while in Israel and the occupied territory. He talked about the two-state solution, without so much as mentioning the situation in Gaza. Biden spent more than two days doing a series of visits, meetings, and press conferences on the Israeli side, but just a few hours in the occupied Palestinian territory, and no prospects for a relaunch of Israel-Palestine talks.This Biden trip is a preview of US foreign policy in an era of great power competition with China and new fault lines of a world divided by Russian aggression. There are trade-offs. “You sanction Russian oil, and you give power to Middle Eastern autocrats,” Khalidi told me. “The only reason he’s sidling up to these human rights abusers is because of the knock-on effects of the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, and the energy impact of that invasion.”Or, as Freeman put it, “The message to the people in the region is we only care about you in the context of our great power rivalry.”Despite the emphasis on Russia, there was little movement on solidifying a Middle East coalition in support of Ukraine. The United Arab Emirates is a major hub for Russian businesspeople and dirty money, and that seems unlikely to change. Egypt is a hot spot for Russian tourists. Saudi Arabia and Israel are still fence-sitters in the Ukraine conflict, hesitant to definitively take a side. While Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE voted to condemn Russia’s invasion in the UN resolution, none has joined the US-led sanctions against Moscow.Yet all of these regional powers are making demands of the US to take a harder line on Iran and enable them militarily. (Wait, wouldn’t realpolitik be crafting a deal with Iran, and getting more oil production online in the process?)In the way that Washington has rationalized the need for Biden to travel to Saudi Arabia, Tejasvi Nagaraja, a professor at Cornell University, sees echoes of a term put forward by the late sociologist C. Wright Mills in the 1950s, “crackpot realism.” “You have a certain response from people, who if Mills was here today he might call crackpot realists,” Nagaraja told me. That is, experts in the “foreign policy establishment and think tanks and media, who say, ‘This is not the time for values or idealism, this is the time for hard-nosed interests.’” Tough decisions are made under the guise of realism, the foreign policy school of thinking that prioritizes national interests above all else, and ends up justifying precarious, risky choices — like Biden fist-bumping an autocrat.In the end, the US comes across as a fragile empire. Fragile because of its own democratic backsliding and Biden’s domestic political struggles. And fragile because Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel appear to be handled with extreme caution by Washington despite the US being the superpower.

Things are about to get much worse in the war between Israel and Hamas,2023-10-08,Vox,['Ellen Ioanes'],"Filed under:Here’s how a war between Israel and Hamas could play out.Israel suffered its most devastating attack in decades Saturday when Hamas militants launched thousands of rockets from Gaza and infiltrated several Israeli towns, killing hundreds of people and taking an as-yet-unknown number of hostages, both military and civilian.Given the scale and brutality of the attack, Israel may launch a ground invasion in Gaza, in addition to the airstrikes the military is already conducting in the region. That could mean a long, bloody battle with significant deaths on both sides, but with Palestinians bearing the brunt of the casualties and destruction. Tell us by filling out this form. We’ll try to answer your questions in an upcoming story.The death toll on both sides is already in the hundreds, with injuries from airstrikes in Gaza and rocket attacks and gunfights in southern Israel numbering in the thousands. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, began launching retaliatory strikes shortly after the initial shock invasion Saturday; on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu officially declared war against Hamas. Although the next phase of Israel’s operation in Gaza hasn’t yet unfolded, it’s likely to be catastrophic given previous conflicts between Israel and Gaza, as well as Netanyahu’s heightened rhetoric.“In a way, this is our 9/11,” IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said in a video statement posted to the social network X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday. Videos have circulated showing dead Israelis, as well as Israeli civilians being captured by Hamas militants, presumably to be held in Gaza. Though some hostages in Israeli towns near the Gaza border have been freed and their captors killed, many remain in captivity and some are presumed dead.

  Netanyahu, meanwhile, has told Gazans to leave the territory and threatened to turn it into “a deserted island,” Al Jazeera reported Sunday; many civilians are sheltering at schools built by the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees, UNRWA, some of which have been damaged by Israeli airstrikes, the Associated Press reports. Israel has fought multiple wars against Palestinians and Arab nations including Syria and Egypt; it has also launched ground operations in Gaza, most recently in 2014. Though Israeli military policy is to use disproportionate force in Gaza as a deterrent strategy, that has so far failed to enact durable security, limit Hamas’s ability to strike Israel, or allow space in Israeli politics for any sort of political negotiation that could lead to a more peaceful future. Civilians have reportedly left Gaza City and areas near the border in anticipation of a ground invasion, according to the New York Times, and Netanyahu has called up IDF reservists and ordered 24 villages and towns near the border to be evacuated. The government has also shut off electricity to the region and halted the flow of fuel and goods to Gaza, which has been under blockade by Israel and Egypt for 16 years.  “I don’t know the likelihood of a ground invasion — I would say, if I were calculating odds, the chances of a ground invasion are greater than they were in previous rounds of violence in Gaza,” Khaled Elgindy, director of the Middle East Institute’s Program on Palestine and Palestinian-Israeli Affairs, told Vox. “In the past, we’ve seen reports of ground invasions being imminent and they’ve turned out to be inaccurate or even deliberate misinformation put out there by the Israeli military.”The Netanyahu government has typically preferred airstrikes to retaliate against Hamas’s rocket attacks, as they minimize Israeli casualties and inflict serious damage in Gaza. During the last major attack on Gaza, in May 2021, Israeli airstrikes ostensibly targeting Hamas leadership and targets also hit civilian sites including media offices, residential buildings, and health care facilities. More than 250 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed in the 11-day conflict. “Netanyahu ... he’s always been very cautious around widespread use of military force,” Daniel Byman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox. “He hasn’t done the kind of big wars like we saw in Lebanon in 2006, so he tends to be cautious. But it may be hard to be cautious in these circumstances.”Israel has put boots on the ground in Gaza before, and occupied the territory from 1967 to 2005, when it unilaterally withdrew from the region. When they are ordered, ground incursions tend to be horrific, causing devastating infrastructure damage and heavy civilian casualties on the Palestinian side. In 2014, simmering conflict in Gaza exploded into a major Hamas rocket offensive into Israel, which responded with a 19-day ground invasion. Though there was an Egypt-mediated ceasefire in August of that year, 2,251 Palestinians — including 1,462 civilians — and 73 Israelis were killed in the fighting, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, told Vox that, given the nature of the attack and current public and political sentiment in Israel, a ground invasion was “very likely.” “The mood in Israel is such that another round of airstrikes or something like that is seen to pale in comparison to the task,” he said, “not only for the general mood of vengeance in the country — which is certainly there — but also the question of how can Hamas capabilities actually be degraded and a repeat of some sort be prevented.”Operation Cast Lead in 2008 and 2009 wreaked havoc on the Gaza Strip; the first day of airstrikes alone killed 230 Palestinians. After a week of intensive aerial bombardment, Israeli forces launched a two-week invasion from the north and the east while Israel’s navy shelled the area from the sea. Overall, though sources vary in specifics, around 1,400 Palestinians and nine Israelis were killed during that operation.

  Israel’s asymmetric response is supposed to serve a deterrent purpose, Byman told Vox, but the country has also, at least in the past, had a vested interest in keeping Hamas in power. According to a 2017 research brief by the RAND corporation, Israel has the military capability to wipe out Hamas, but doing so could perhaps be even riskier than not, given that an even more extreme organization could come into power — or that Israel could be put into the position of governing the territory itself. “As such, Israel’s grand strategy became ‘mowing the grass’ — accepting its inability to permanently solve the problem and instead repeatedly targeting leadership of Palestinian militant organizations to keep violence manageable.”“We want to break their bones without putting them in the hospital,” one Israeli defense analyst told the research brief’s authors. Just two days into the war, what comes next is impossible to predict. But given what’s known about previous conflicts and the capabilities of both sides, the coming weeks are likely to be bloody. UN agencies have urged both sides to avoid civilian casualties, though reports of civilian deaths on both sides are already high. “The immediate phase will be Israel sweeping up its own villages and towns, making sure that there are no Hamas fighters left there,” Sachs said. The IDF confirmed that assessment in an email statement to Vox. Israel will then need to gather intelligence on where Hamas leadership is and determine the number of hostages missing and their locations, which will be a challenging task, Sachs said. International leaders have affirmed unwavering support for Israel, and the US has pledged to send additional military materiel, “including munitions,” according to a press release from the Defense Department, with the first tranche of security assistance headed to Israel today.In addition to the materiel support, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Sunday afternoon’s statement that the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, which includes an aircraft carrier and multiple guided missile destroyers, has been deployed to the eastern Mediterranean. “We have also taken steps to augment U.S. Air Force F-35, F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighter aircraft squadrons in the region,” the statement reads. DoD did not respond to Vox’s additional questions about this change in force posture by publication time Sunday, but such a show of force is likely meant to serve as a deterrent to other actors like Hezbollah or Iran. Despite the overwhelming Israeli and US military might it faces, Hamas has not yet shown signs of backing down.“Hamas has lost the element of surprise but it has likely prepared to stick in for the long haul, probably has a lot of supplies,” Colin Clarke, research director at the Soufan Group, told Vox in an email. “I think Hamas still has a robust arsenal of rockets and could be planning more ambushes. I wouldn’t be surprised to see suicide bombings, if Hamas is able to infiltrate more operatives onto Israeli soil. But once Israel gears up and mobilizes, its military is likely to make quick work of Hamas, killing and capturing its leaders and decimating its infrastructure.”And despite the possibility — even likelihood — of serious casualties in the coming days and weeks, Sachs said, “Israel is not about to de-escalate now.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"The killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, explained",2022-05-11,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:Shireen Abu Akleh covered occupied Palestine for two decades. She was killed doing her job. For over two decades, journalist Shireen Abu Akleh covered human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territory. A generation grew up watching the Al Jazeera broadcaster break down some of the most difficult pieces of news to cover. On Wednesday morning local time, she was shot and killed while doing the same, reporting on a raid of the West Bank city of Jenin by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). In a statement, Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based Arab news network, accused Israeli forces of killing her, calling it “a blatant murder” and “heinous crime, which intends to only prevent the media from conducting their duty.” The Palestinian Health Ministry also blamed the Israeli military.Israel attributed Abu Akleh’s death to Palestinian gunmen, saying she was caught in the crossfire of clashes. Multiple witnesses, however, said that it is more likely she was shot by IDF forces than Palestinian. If that bears out, Abu Akleh’s killing will fit into a larger pattern of attacks on the press in Palestine and in the systemic violence against Palestinians more broadly.The language that an Israeli spokesperson used Wednesday to describe the work of Palestinian journalists underscored that reality. Israeli military spokesperson Ran Kochav said, “They’re armed with cameras, if you’ll permit me to say so,” and in so doing drew a not-subtle comparison between the work of journalism and that of violence. Israel’s defense minister Benny Gantz announced an investigation Wednesday and released body-cam footage from the army, striking a more cautious tone than earlier Israeli statements. Palestinian authorities declined to participate in the investigation and have refused to share the bullet with Israeli authorities. Now that bullet is at the center of the two competing investigations — even as tensions simmer on the ground.On Friday in Jerusalem, thousands of mourners gathered for Abu Akleh’s funeral procession in what may be the largest public outpouring there since the death of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat in 2004. As the casket was carried out of a Jerusalem hospital’s gates, Israeli police attacked mourners with batons and set off stun grenades, violence that almost caused the pallbearers to drop Abu Akleh’s coffin.If an investigation ultimately does find Israeli soldiers responsible, it wouldn’t be the first time the country’s military has targeted the press. Israel has killed more than 50 Palestinian journalists since 2001, according to the Palestinian Journalism Syndicate, and Reporters Without Borders has recorded more than 144 journalists injured in just the last four years. “In terms of the event itself, unfortunately, it is not unique, not different,” says Saleh Hijazi, the deputy director of Amnesty International’s Middle East program. “It fits a pattern, a pattern of unlawful killing, and also a pattern of targeting journalists and human rights defenders.” Abu Akleh had become a leading media voice when she reported on the 2000 uprising, or intifada, that came to define the past two decades of violent inertia between Israel and Palestine. She had continued documenting the Israeli occupation and the daily lives of those living in Palestine, and was one of the most well-known faces of Palestinian journalism. “She was the voice of Palestine to the rest of the Arab world and its diaspora,” said Mezna Qato, a historian at the University of Cambridge. “She was the one who forced the Arab world to remember, to contend with, and to take seriously what it means to disengage from the question of Palestine.”On Wednesday, she was reporting from Jenin, where the IDF had been conducting, as it put it, “counterterrorism activity to apprehend terrorist suspects.” Israeli forces have been conducting more raids in Jenin after several recent deadly attacks in Israel, which Israel has attributed to militants from the city. Abu Akleh and four or so other journalists arrived in Jenin early Wednesday morning. Clashes between IDF and Palestinian gunmen were reported in the city. Gathered several hundred feet away from Israeli forces, the journalists were watching from afar as an Israeli raid on a Palestinian home took place. At the crackling of gunshots, the group took cover, but Abu Akleh appeared to already be shot. According to the Associated Press, she was brought to the hospital, where she died. Ali Samoudi, her producer, who was also shot and in the hospital Wednesday, said Israeli forces shot her. Two Palestinian witnesses also attributed the killing to Israeli forces, telling the Times of Israel that the buildings around the area were filled with soldiers.A fragment of the bullet was removed from her head during the autopsy; the director of the Palestinian forensic institute said he was not yet able to identify who fired it. And if, as Israeli officials told the New York Times, both sides were firing M16 rifles Wednesday, it might be ultimately difficult to determine who fired it without testing individual rifles.Samoudi said, regardless, there were no armed Palestinian fighters nearby and that Abu Akleh was killed “in cold blood.” An entire nation in grief. Renowned Palestinian journalist @ShireenNasri, an icon for all of us who grew up watching her everyday on TV, has just been shot dead by Israeli forces. I still can’t believe the news. pic.twitter.com/EGeljWkXwoIsraeli army chief Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi told the AP, “At this stage, we cannot determine by whose fire she was harmed and we regret her death.” Earlier statements from the government, however, more directly blamed Palestinians. The Israeli military’s Twitter feed said it was “investigating the event and looking into the possibility that journalists were hit by the Palestinian gunmen.” That explanation was echoed by Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who said “armed Palestinians shot in an inaccurate, indiscriminate, and uncontrolled manner” during the IDF’s operation.  “Our forces from the IDF returned fire as accurately, carefully, and responsibly as possible. Sadly, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in the exchange,” Bennett said. The Israeli foreign ministry shared a video of Palestinian gunmen active in the city Wednesday to back up these claims. But a researcher with the preeminent Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem analyzed the footage and reported that the gunman in the video was in a separate location in Jenin entirely.Israeli leaders, including the prime minister and the secretary of defense, do not usually make pronouncements about such things; that they issued statements along these lines about Abu Akleh shows the weight of this killing. The last two months have seen a significant uptick in violence in Israel and Palestine, with the most deaths in that span since 2008, according to Amnesty International. Amnesty has documented 34 Palestinians killed, including six children, in March and April, and 18 people have been killed in Israeli cities in attacks in recent weeks. “You only have this happen because there is no addressing of root causes, which is apartheid, because Israel is able to enjoy this impunity, mainly because of the role that the US and other Western allies play,” Hijazi said.US Ambassador to Israel Thomas Nides said that he encouraged “a thorough investigation into the circumstances of [Abu Akleh’s] death and the injury of at least one other journalist today in Jenin.” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said, “those responsible must be held accountable.” The Israeli government said that it would jointly investigate the killing with the Palestinian Authority, but the Palestinian side declined to provide Abu Akleh’s body or share the bullet that killed her with Israeli authorities. That likely has something to do with the Israeli government not having a good track record of investigating its own crimes. Israel doesn’t allow international investigations of violations in the country or the occupied territories, and in recent years has chosen not to cooperate or provide access to UN commissions or special rapporteurs. Israel has even designated the premier Palestinian rights organization Al-Haq as a terrorist organization, in what experts called retribution for Al-Haq’s documentation of violations on the ground. “No one should believe the Israeli promises to quote-unquote investigate what has happened because the promise of investigations are nothing but the first step in Israel’s organized whitewash,” said Hagai El-Ad, executive director of the rights group B’Tselem. “Israel is unable and unwilling to conduct such investigations which opens the door to international legal responsibility.”B’Tselem has stopped cooperating with the Israeli government on investigations. Israel tends to stretch out the investigations as long as possible and in the end fails to hold military leaders to account, according to El-Ad. “Israel treats every incident as an extraordinarily exceptional occurrence, and the investigations always push the responsibility down to the lowest level of soldiers,” he told me. “It shouldn’t surprise anyone — it’s the army that’s investigating the army.”Israel has maintained that it is committed to investigations, including one devoted to Abu Akleh’s death.“To uncover the truth, there must be a real investigation, and the Palestinians are currently preventing that,” Prime Minister Bennett said in a statement. “Without a serious investigation, we will not reach the truth.”For Omar Shakir of Human Rights Watch, the situation reflects the larger structural dynamic. “Their calls for investigations [are] as if it’s a few bad apples in a situation that’s otherwise normal, but that’s not the reality. Palestinians live in a situation of grave underlying structural violence,” he told me. “This underlying daily reality of apartheid and the cold violence of structural repression leads to the hot violence of bloodshed and the killing of Palestinians.”Abu Akleh has already merited tributes from US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who had met Abu Akleh recently and said she had “extraordinary respect for her.”It was important, too, that Abu Akleh was a woman delivering the news to Arabic-speaking audiences worldwide. “So many girls wanted to be her. So many aspiring journalists have told me they would stand in front of a mirror and use a hairbrush and pretend it were a microphone, and basically pretend to be Shireen,” said Dalia Hatuqa, a journalist and friend of Abu Akleh.“Now she’s been silenced in this utterly violent way that echoes some of her own reporting,” Qato told me.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Kamala Harris’s foreign policy, explained",2020-08-14,Vox,['Alex Ward'],"Filed under:It’s more robust than you might think.When it comes to foreign policy, Sen. Kamala Harris is very much the “simpatico” running mate Joe Biden was looking for.Based on her Senate record, answers to questionnaires when she was a presidential candidate, debate remarks, and interviews with those who know her, many of her foreign policy views fall right in line with Biden’s.Harris views America’s alliances and partnerships as crucial to solving global problems such as the coronavirus pandemic and climate change. She would prioritize diplomacy, human rights, and the promotion of democratic values like the rule of law — meaning that, among other things, she would push China to stop persecuting Uighur Muslims and cracking down on free speech in Hong Kong. And she’d focus on rebuilding economic strength and easing social tensions in the US so that the country could present a stronger, more united front abroad.Harris, then, would staunchly bolster Biden’s global vision while in the White House. “In general, she is an internationalist,” said Halie Soifer, Harris’s national security adviser in the Senate from January 2017 to May 2018. “She would be a champion for rebuilding those alliances, partnerships, and America’s credibility in the world.”The question some have is whether Harris would aim to exert as much power over foreign policy as previous vice presidents, such as Dick Cheney — or Biden himself. Most people I spoke to don’t believe so. “I don’t see her as much of a foreign policy leader,” Justin Logan, a US foreign policy expert at the Catholic University of America, told me.“She obviously has very limited experience in the field,” Emma Ashford, a research fellow in defense and foreign policy at the CATO Institute, said.But she could still make a splash as Biden’s No. 2: Harris is a critic of autocratic regimes, namely Russia and Saudi Arabia, and would certainly continue her rebukes. She remains a firm backer of Israel, to the chagrin of many progressive activists, and may reject calls to weaken America’s relationship with the country.As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Harris gained an appreciation for defending against foreign election interference and the dangers of cyberspace. Yet she’s been open about wanting to cut defense spending — usually an unpopular stance in US politics, and one that President Donald Trump has already seized on as a means of attacking her.“She wants to slash funds for our military at a level that nobody has — can even believe,” Trump said during a press conference Tuesday.Foreign policy in a Biden administration would undoubtedly be led primarily by Biden himself, yet Harris still has the potential to be an impactful vice president on the world stage.“Democrats certainly have confidence in Harris’s abilities to give her more space on foreign policy issues,” said Zachary Hosford, who worked with the senator’s office on global issues as an adviser to Sen. Edward Markey (D-MA). “I certainly would have confidence in her abilities there.”Biden has spent decades working on foreign policy, and many believe he’d be loath to relinquish control of that area to Harris. Indeed, that she’s not known for her global vision may be one reason he chose her as his running mate.“I’d say that Joe Biden didn’t pick her for foreign policy credentials. He already has that angle covered,” said CATO’s Ashford. “She’s as likely to be steered by his foreign policy views as the other way around.”That may be true, but it helps that both candidates on the Democratic ticket share remarkably similar foreign policy views. Here are the three main ones.Since the end of World War II, Democrats and Republicans have pursued largely similar approaches to US foreign policy. Presidents from both parties have used America’s power to underwrite and maintain what’s called the “liberal international order,” which basically means the set of economic and political rules and values that help the world function.The US never did this out of the goodness of its heart. Promoting free trade and liberal democracy was meant to provide America with markets to sell goods to and countries with which to build alliances against adversaries. It was never a perfect system, and the US made many, many errors along the way. But overall, that grand strategy helped the US maintain its position as the world’s preeminent power.That, in a nutshell, is the world Biden and Harris want to restore and protect.“For the past seven decades, the choices we have made — particularly the United States and our allies in Europe — have steered our world down a clear path,” Biden said in a speech at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in January 2017, just two days before leaving office as vice president. “In recent years it has become evident that the consensus upholding this system is facing increasing pressures, from within and from without. It’s imperative that we act urgently to defend the liberal international order.”Compare that with an answer Harris gave to the Council on Foreign Relations while she was running for president: “The greatest US foreign policy accomplishment has been the post-war community of international institutions, laws, and democratic nations we helped to build.”Harris believes America keeping its commitments to allies helps bolster the nation’s power. “Part of the strength of who we are as a nation — and therefore, an extension of our ability to be secure — is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal,” Harris said during a Democratic presidential debate in November 2019.Those views are key to understanding how Harris sees the world, those who know her told me. “She understands the importance of partnerships and alliances when it comes to our national security,” Rebecca Bill Chavez, a top member of Harris’s presidential campaign foreign policy team, said.Those close to Biden told me he’ll make human rights an important aspect of his foreign policy. Whether it’s reprimanding Saudi Arabia for the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi or pushing China to end the internment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, Biden plans to spend ample time on those and similar issues.Harris would be fully on board with that agenda, people who worked with her said. “The issue of human rights is incredibly important to her,” said Soifer, the senator’s former national security adviser.She’s already made defending human rights a significant part of her work in the Senate.In June 2019, Harris voted to block arms sales to Riyadh to punish Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi’s murder as well as for the war it leads in Yemen, which has seen thousands killed and millions displaced. Harris also voted to end US support for that war earlier the same year — a war Biden has also vowed to pull America out of.In the Council on Foreign Relations questionnaire, she also floated the idea of downgrading US-Saudi ties. “[W]e need to fundamentally reevaluate our relationship with Saudi Arabia, using our leverage to stand up for American values and interests,” Harris answered, though she acknowledged that there are areas — such as counterterrorism — on which the two nations could still cooperate.Harris has also been very outspoken about China’s human rights abuses. She and 55 other senators co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which would end the special relationship between the US and the city Beijing aims to take over completely. And she joined 65 of her colleagues as a co-sponsor on the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020, which President Trump signed into law in June.The law imposes sanctions on foreign individuals and entities involved in abuses in Xinjiang; it also requires the president to “periodically report to Congress a list identifying foreign individuals and entities responsible for such human rights abuses.”Whether Harris maintains her staunch human rights defense while making complicated foreign policy deals with tough global leaders will be one of the more challenging dynamics of her time in office.Biden has promised that, as president, he would have the US rejoin the Paris climate agreement from which Trump withdrew. During her presidential campaign, Harris pledged the same. She also said she’d make climate change a central focus of America’s relationships abroad.“Governments around the world should be bringing dangerous coal-fired power plants offline, not bringing new plants online, and underscoring that necessity should be front and center in every one of our bilateral relationships,” she told the Council on Foreign Relations. “We should also play a leadership role in compelling international institutions to use their leverage to end subsidies for dirty fuel.”As a senator from California — a heavily Democratic state that has experienced extreme wildfires and flooded rivers, among other effects connected to climate change — it’s no surprise that Harris has made this a big priority.In her 2019 book The Truths We Hold: An American Journey, she spent considerable time detailing the risks climate change poses to the world:[C]limate change will lead to droughts. Droughts will lead to famine. Famine will drive desperate people to leave their homes in search of sustenance. Massive flows of displaced people will lead to refugee crises. Refugee crisis will lead to tension and instability across borders. ...The hard truth is that climate change is going to cause terrible instability and desperation, and that will put American national security at risk.Put together, Harris will be in lockstep with Biden on some of his major foreign policy stances.But she could also use her time in office to focus on some additional areas of particular interest to her — and potentially garner both positive and negative attention for doing so.Many experts say Harris could carve out a role for herself — somewhat independent of Biden, but still with his blessing — on three key foreign policy areas.As a freshman senator, Harris got the rare opportunity to serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where she delved deeply into the myriad national security threats facing the US.Intelligence Committee members “are privy to some of the most clear threats the US has,” a person familiar with her views told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the Biden campaign. One of the main threats Harris focused was Russian election interference, the former aide said.It’s something she speaks about often. “When they influenced our elections, they diminished in some ways the integrity of our election system, and therefore their goal was accomplished,” Harris said at the Lesbians Who Tech & Allies virtual Pride Summit in June. “And they did it through technology.” Mandating paper ballots on Election Day, Harris has proposed, is one way to help strengthen the security of US elections.California is home to Silicon Valley, and many of Harris’s most powerful constituents are intensely focused on securing their technologies against attacks from Russia, as well as from China, North Korea, and Iran.She’s clearly soaked up a lot of their concerns. “Cyber warfare is silent warfare,” she wrote in her 2019 book. “I sometimes refer to it as a war without blood: There are no soldiers in the field, no bullets and bombs. But the reality is cyber warfare aims to weaponize infrastructure and, at its worst, could result in casualties.”As a younger, more tech-savvy politician than Biden, Harris could potentially take a bigger role in safeguarding America’s electoral system and US-made technologies.In June, Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a 10 percent cut to the national defense budget — which is currently over $700 billion — to pay for other priorities, including health care, education, and investment in new jobs. It was a controversial amendment to a defense bill that failed multiple times in Congress, and Harris voted against the measure.Yet she made clear she backed the general thinking behind it. “I unequivocally agree with the goal of reducing the defense budget and redirecting funding to communities in need, but it must be done strategically,” Harris said in a statement on her decision to oppose the amendment. “I remain supportive of the effort, and am hopeful that with the benefit of additional time, future efforts will more specifically address these complicated issues and earn my enthusiastic support.”Harris’s hesitance to vote for such a large cut makes sense: California has the largest population of military members and their families in the US — a fact she explicitly noted in her statement — and such a constituency certainly cares about the size of the US defense budget.However, Harris did vote against another increase to the budget in July, and has long said some of the money the military usually gets could go to diplomats and investments in other parts of the federal budget, such as technological innovation, education, and environmental protection.Cutting the defense budget will certainly meet stiff resistance from most Republicans and some Democrats, should Biden and Harris both agree it’s a good idea (those close to Biden told me he’d likely push to cut the defense budget). Harris could use her relationships from her time in the Senate to lobby allies to vote for a cut, which would place her squarely in the center of a major initiative of the Biden administration.Progressive Democrats in recent years have called for a reevaluation of America’s decades-long close relationship with Israel, concerned about the rightward shift in Israeli politics under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government’s policies toward the Palestinians.Many progressives weren’t happy to see Biden become the likely nominee — and they’re not likely to be any happier with Harris as his running mate.Simply put, she’s been unequivocal about standing by Israel. Her first foreign policy vote in January 2017 was to criticize the UN for condemning the country on its settlements in Palestinian territories. Later that year, she spoke at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a US lobbying group that advocates for a strong US-Israel relationship. “I believe the bonds between the United States and Israel are unbreakable. And we can never let anyone drive a wedge between us,” she said. “[The] first resolution I co-sponsored as a United States senator was to combat anti-Israel bias at the United Nations and reaffirm that the United States seeks a just, secure, and sustainable two-state solution,” she told the crowd, though she didn’t highlight that many other Democrats also signed on to the bipartisan resolution.In 2018, she attended the conference again, this time giving an off-the-record address that was recorded and shared on social media by several attendees. In her speech, she made a surprising revelation: “As a child, I never sold Girl Scout cookies, I went around with a JNFUSA box collecting funds to plant trees in Israel.” JNFUSA stands for the Jewish National Fund-USA, the US branch of a nonprofit organization founded in 1901 with the express mission of purchasing land in Ottoman-controlled Palestine to be used to form a future Jewish state. The organization played a major role in pushing Palestinians out of their lands to make way for the state of Israel.To raise money for this effort, “Jews the world over collected coins in iconic JNF Blue Boxes, purchasing land and planting trees until ultimately, their dream of a Jewish homeland was a reality,” the JNF notes on its website.Right now: @KamalaHarris speaking at @AIPAC!! 2020!! pic.twitter.com/pcQPwxhmjrIn more recent times, the JNF has courted controversy over allegations that it funds development projects in Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank — settlements that are illegal under international law and that have been opposed by both Democratic and Republican US administrations. And while Harris skipped the 2019 conference, as many Democratic presidential hopefuls did, she still hosted California AIPAC members in her Senate office that March to discuss, among other things, “the need for a strong U.S.-Israel alliance” and “the right of Israel to defend itself.”Soifer, the former national security adviser who is now the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, told me that Harris’s views on Israel “go beyond just the security relationship, of which she’s very supportive.”She pointed me to Harris’s November 2017 trip to Israel. Soifer was with the senator and watched Harris try to improve ties between California and Israel’s technology sectors. What most struck Harris, Soifer said, was how Israeli companies had made strides in conserving water, an issue California has struggled with and that the senator is deeply interested in.In her 2019 book, Harris wrote about a subsequent trip she took to Israel to delve deeper into water conservation issues:There’s a lot we can learn from friends and partners who have already made such investments—especially Israel, a global leader on water security issues. In February 2018, I traveled to Israel and toured its Sorek desalination plant, which uses reverse osmosis to produce clean drinking water from the sea. I had a glass. It tasted as good as any water I’ve ever had.Harris received a lot of criticism for her 2017 Israel trip, mainly because she met with Netanyahu. Soifer said Harris took the meeting because, whether Harris liked him or not, Netanyahu was the elected leader of the country. “They had a good meeting, a lengthy meeting,” she told me, noting Harris pushed Netanyahu not to unilaterally annex any territory.Soifer said that trip, and Harris’s decision to meet with Netanyahu despite the criticism, is a testament to the senator’s fearlessness on the world stage. “She’s truly a leader and does what she thinks is right and is not persuaded by what other people think,” she told me. Still, Harris will have to walk a fine line between maintaining the US-Israel relationship and keeping certain Democratic activists happy by pushing back on Netanyahu’s anti-Palestinian policies.Of course, Harris has many more foreign policy stances. Like Biden, she aims to end the war in Afghanistan, reenter the Iran nuclear deal as long as Tehran is in compliance with it, keep North Korea from advancing its nuclear arsenal, allow more refugees in from places like Venezuela, and much more.But it’s her major agreements with Biden — and the other areas where Harris might gain attention, both good and bad — where her foreign policy views matter most. She may not be a very powerful vice president when it comes to global affairs, but she’ll likely make her views heard, one way or the other.Will you become our 20,000th supporter?

New data shows how the Trump administration is destroying the State Department,2017-11-08,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Sixty percent of State’s equivalent of four-star generals are gone.Imagine a company where, in the past year, 60 percent of its top management quit and applicants to work there dropped by half. You’d assume that corporation would be on the verge of going bankrupt or in the throes of some catastrophe — Enron after the scandal or Lehman Brothers during the financial crisis.This is the reality of the US State Department under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to new data from the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), the professional organization for America’s diplomatic corps. The numbers reveal that American diplomacy, the backbone of US global influence, is in a state of near collapse. And it’s basically all the Trump administration’s fault.The new AFSA data focuses on the top-ranking career officials — meaning people who have spent their lives in the State Department. This includes minister counselors (the equivalent of two-star generals), career ministers (the three-star equivalent), and career ambassadors (the four-star equivalent).The number of people in each of those posts has declined dramatically since President Trump took office in January. The number of minister counselors in the State Department has gone down by 15 percent, career ministers by 42 percent, and career ambassadors by a whopping 60 percent.“Like the military, the Foreign Service recruits officers at entry level and grows them into seasoned leaders over decades,” explains Barbara Stephenson, the head of AFSA, in a letter Tuesday announcing the new findings. “The talent being shown the door now is not only our top talent, but also talent that cannot be replicated overnight.”It’s not even clear that this can be fixed over a number of years, because the State Department isn’t hiring at the entry level either. The number of entry-level foreign service officer hires has declined from 366 in 2016 to a scant 100 in 2017, owing to a hiring freeze Tillerson imposed after his Senate confirmation. The number of people who took the Foreign Service exam, the main requirement to become a foreign service officer, dropped by more than half between 2016 and 2017. To understand the consequences of this understaffing, it’s useful again to go back to the company analogy. A company that has lost much of its senior staff, isn’t promoting people to replace them, and isn’t hiring many new people wouldn’t be able to perform its basic functions — selling products, coming up with new business strategies, etc. — particularly well. In this case, the “products” are little things like negotiating a solution to the North Korea crisis and helping manage US alliances, while the new business strategy is coming up with strategies for the world over. The US military can do many things when it comes to foreign policy, but it can’t fill in for diplomats. Without a functioning State Department, foreign diplomats have no one to talk to at the world’s most powerful address — and that scares them.Elizabeth Saunders, a professor at George Washington University who studies US foreign policy, compares the US under Tillerson’s emaciated State Department to a person who doesn’t have health insurance. “Your life is probably fine — up until the point you get sick,” she told me. And given crises in places as diverse as Ukraine, Syria, and Venezuela, the world is at least starting to develop a cough.Some of the blame for the dismal state of affairs at State accrues to the president’s seeming disinterest in maintaining a conventional foreign policy. But Tillerson, personally, is the bigger problem. Through hiring freezes, caps on the number of promotions, shuttering of whole sections of the State Department, and support for budget cuts, he has convinced the staff that he is basically out to destroy the department — leading many to simply quit.“Secretary Tillerson’s term has led to widespread demoralization in the foreign service, the dismissal or resignation of people with expertise that individually may not be irreplaceable but as a cohort certainly becomes so,” Paul Musgrave, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told me earlier this year. “That hinders the State Department’s ability to enhance US interests through diplomacy.”This management approach has led to a rare bipartisan consensus among Republican and Democratic State Department veterans that Tillerson, when he quits, will rank among the very worst people to hold the job in American history. No other secretary, it seems, has done so much damage to US diplomacy in so little time.“I think he really will go down as one of the worst secretaries of State we've had,"" Eliot Cohen, counselor to the State Department under President George W. Bush, told Axios’s Jonathan Swan. “He will go down as the worst secretary of state in history,” tweeted Ilan Goldenberg, an Obama-era official who worked on Israel-Palestine issues.The numbers released by AFSA, then, are not some kind of dry corporate assessment. They are proof of a crisis — one that’s largely being ignored by the general public.UPDATE: On Thursday, one day after this story was published, the State Department wrote to me to contest the AFSA data showing depletion in the ranks of senior diplomats. A State Department spokesperson argued that there had been no significant decline in the number of foreign service officers and that retirement levels were within historical norms.“These facts will again be reinforced once the freezes on personnel movement, including hiring, are lifted at the appropriate time,” the spokesperson said.

Why Israel hasn’t annexed the West Bank,2020-07-17,Vox,['Conor Murray'],"Filed under:This week’s Worldly episode explores why Israel backed down and what that means for the two-state solution.All eyes were on Israel on July 1, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government was set to annex parts of the West Bank — but then, well, nothing happened.On this week’s episode of Worldly, Vox’s weekly international podcast, senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp, international security and defense reporter Alex Ward, and senior foreign editor Jennifer Williams discuss what happened — or rather, why nothing happened — and what it all means for the future of the long-sought “two-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu’s plan to annex approximately 30 percent of the West Bank would have dramatically altered the situation in the Israeli-occupied territory, which is home to nearly 3 million Palestinians as well as around 500,000 Jewish settlers. And, as Vox’s Jen Kirby explains, it would have upended years of consensus about the two-state framework, historically supported by the United States and the international community. Under that plan, the vast bulk of the West Bank would eventually, as part of a final peace deal between the two sides, be transferred to the Palestinians to form the core of an independent state of Palestine. But peace talks have stalled for years, and there is no deal anywhere on the horizon. So the Israeli right has been pushing for Netanyahu’s government to just go ahead and unilaterally annex significant portions of the West Bank that it wants to keep, making them officially part of Israel proper, regardless of what the Palestinians think about it.Netanyahu promised to follow through on a plan to do just that on July 1, but then everything seemed to go wrong (for him).Not only is Netanyahu currently on trial for corruption charges, but Israel is also facing a massive coronavirus resurgence that has quickly outpaced the first outbreak. Benny Gantz, who is due to serve as the next prime minister, is urging Netanyahu to address the relentless second wave first.Possibly more consequential is the swift international condemnation of Israel’s annexation plan — the United Nations says it’s illegal, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson penned an op-ed against the plan. Even the United States hesitated to support the move, despite it being a direct result of the Trump administration’s “peace plan.”To hear more about all the factors that led to Netanyahu’s sudden reversal, how US politics plays into this, and what it all means for the future of the two-state solution, listen to the full episode of Worldly, which you can stream below.

5 things to know about one of Israel’s most important elections in decades,2019-04-09,Vox,['Alexia Underwood'],"Filed under:Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz are both vying to be Israel’s next prime minister. Israelis head to the polls Tuesday in what could be the most consequential election in decades.Right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu, who has spent a total of 13 years in power, is seeking his fourth consecutive term. It’s one of the toughest election fights he’s ever encountered. Netanyahu is facing possible indictment by Israel’s attorney general on fraud and corruption charges, and he’s also going up against a particularly formidable opponent: Benny Gantz, a centrist former military chief whose impressive national security credentials pose a direct threat to Netanyahu’s grip on power.President Donald Trump has taken a number of steps to help shore up victory for Netanyahu, one of his closest allies in the region — including making the decision last month to formally recognize Israeli sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights.But the prime minister still seems worried that power could slip from his grasp — and polls suggest he has a right to be. On Saturday, in what was seen as a dramatic, last-minute attempt to energize far-right voters and thus tip the scales in his favor, Netanyahu announced that, if elected, he would annex large parts of the West Bank. Officially extending Israeli sovereignty over Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which has long been seen as a critical part of any future Palestinian state, would effectively spell the end of the dwindling hopes of one day achieving peace and creating a real, functional state for Palestinians. It’s anyone’s guess whether Netanyahu’s brash move will be enough to put him over the top — and given the peculiarities of Israel’s parliamentary system, even if his Likud party wins a plurality in Tuesday’s election, it’s still not a guarantee that he will be able to form a coalition government and stay in power.With so much at stake in this election, all eyes will be on Israel. Here are the key issues you need to know so you can follow along.Netanyahu is headed into this election plagued by multiple corruption scandals that just won’t seem to go away. Over the past year, the 69-year-old prime minister has been the focus of three investigations into allegations that he doled out political favors in exchange for positive news coverage and committed fraud, among other things. In late February, Israel’s attorney general announced that he intended to charge the prime minister for crimes related to corruption, pending a hearing. This puts a lot of pressure on Netanyahu and his party to perform well at the polls, because if he manages to retain his position as prime minister, there’s a chance he can pass a law that would basically protect him from being put on trial. “He’s desperate to avoid criminal prosecution,” Ilan Goldenberg, who directs the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington, told me.But while some voters are surely put off by the corruption allegations, many Israelis still see Netanyahu as the right candidate for the job. Israel’s economy has prospered in the past decade, and Netanyahu is seen as being tough on Iran, a country Israel regards as an existential threat. Many view Netanyahu’s close relationship with Trump as another point in his favor. The US president’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the decision to hand sovereignty to Israel over the Golan Heights, and Trump’s much harder line toward Iran have all reflected well on Netanyahu.In another election year, these examples may have been enough to easily counteract stubborn corruption allegations — but it may not be so simple this year. Netanyahu is also facing a particularly compelling opponent.Netanyahu is up against Benny Gantz, a 59-year-old retired general who from 2011 to 2015 served as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff — the supreme commander of the entire Israeli military and its highest-ranked officer. Gantz is new to Israeli politics, and has been described as calm, cool, and soft-spoken. He was reportedly considering the role of Israel’s defense minister before polls showed that he was an extremely popular choice for prime minister prior to him even entering the political arena.In December 2018, Gantz created a new party called Israel Resilience, whose stated platform was to pursue “the continued development and strengthening of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state” and focus on issues like education, agriculture, and internal security. Then in February, Gantz joined forces with the Yesh Atid party to form a centrist alliance that branded itself the Blue and White party, after the colors of the Israeli flag (basically the equivalent of an American political party calling itself the “Red, White, and Blue Party.”) The former military officer has painted himself as a political outsider who would be a breath of fresh air. He’s talked about “uniting” Israel and refocusing on democracy. He’s taken aim at Netanyahu by saying he’ll fight corruption and impose term limits. But he doesn’t differ much from Netanyahu in other areas, like his policy on the Palestinians. He’s also allied with some extremely hawkish politicians in the Knesset. In short, some say, he’s trying to be all things to all people — but mainly offer an alternative to the embattled prime minister.Netanyahu, for his part, has had a lot of success partly by portraying himself as tough on security issues, like his policy toward Iran, and his forceful response to rocket attacks from Gaza. In past elections, that has served him well. But he is finally facing off against someone he can’t so easily paint as weak on security — though he’s certainly tried.In a bid to win support from Israel’s far right, Netanyahu declared over the weekend that he would “extend sovereignty” to the roughly 130 Jewish settlements in the West Bank if he’s reelected.The West Bank is a section of land east of Israel that’s home to about 2.6 million Palestinians. As Vox’s Zack Beauchamp writes, “Israel took control of it in 1967 and has allowed Jewish settlers to move in, but Palestinians (and most of the international community) consider it illegally occupied Palestinian land.”Today, about 622,000 Jewish settlers now live in the West Bank, in enclaves that range from sizable cities with middle-class villas to small encampments.The West Bank would likely form the basis of a future Palestinian state in any two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — a plan that Netanyahu and past US administrations have endorsed. But Netanyahu’s promise to start annexing parts of the region would significantly change things.One reason is that these blocs are spread out across the West Bank. So if they become official territory of the state of Israel, that leaves the land left for a future Palestinian state looking a bit like a piece of Swiss cheese — a bunch of disconnected pieces of territory with sovereign Israeli land dotted throughout. That’s hardly conducive to forming a coherent, sovereign state where Palestinians can one day live in peace.  And that is precisely the point: By annexing these settlements, rather than treating them (at least on paper) as illegal outposts that will one day be dismantled, Netanyahu would essentially be giving a huge gift to the Israeli right. “It seems clear that he is making a bid for right-wing voters and especially the pro-settlement, ‘Greater Israel’ crowd that has been pushing for annexation for several years,” said Khaled Elgindy, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, DC.  “Such a move would likely signal the death knell of the two-state solution, and move Israel closer to a formal apartheid reality on the ground.”In addition to Netanyahu’s desire to shore up support from Israel’s right, there’s another factor behind this announcement. Last month, Trump announced that the US would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a disputed area of land that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War, though the international community regards this as a clear violation of international law.“The reason Netanyahu didn’t do this before is because of the international pressure that’s been brought to bear on him,” said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian Canadian lawyer and former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). “But he got the green light with the recognition of the Golan, and previously with [Trump’s] recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. It’s a process that’s been a long time in coming.”This group — many of whom prefer to be called Palestinians in Israel, or Palestinian citizens of Israel — make up about one-fifth of the Israeli electorate. They include Muslims, Christians, and Druze (a religious minority). Many Arab citizens of Israel are frustrated and disillusioned with the political process, and point to decades of systemic discrimination against them. Buttu specifically pointed to a law that was changed the year before the 2015 election that requires that political parties receive 3.25 percent of total votes cast in order to meet the electoral threshold to join the Knesset (Israel’s parliament). That law, Buttu said, has made it difficult for some minority groups to be properly represented.According to recent polls, only about 50 percent of this group said they planned to vote, and there have been calls to boycott the election. In recent weeks, though, some prominent figures have spoken out to emphasize the importance of participating in the political process, however flawed. Palestinian rapper Tamer Nafar even made a music video encouraging Arabs in Israel to fight racism by making their voices heard at the ballot box. “If our vote will ... imprison Bibi, then we’re ready,” he says.If they do, it could be a game changer, since they could give enough support to Gantz’s bloc that he edges out Netanyahu, Haaretz reports. If they largely decide not to participate, though, Netanyahu has a better chance of winning.Netanyahu has been running a distinctly anti-Arab campaign — even more so than in previous elections. He recently joined with the openly racist, previously banned ultra-right-wing Jewish Power party, which earned him rare criticism from AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups. It’s possible that frustration with Netanyahu’s approach could inspire more Arabs in Israel to cast their ballots — and tip the scales away from the sitting prime minister.According to some polls, Netanyahu’s Likud party has a slight leg up going into the election, but the intricacies of Israel’s electoral system, and the fact that there are still a number of undecided voters, mean the outcome is anything but clear.Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, is composed of 120 seats. Israelis don’t vote for individuals, but instead choose parties. There are dozens of parties competing to win spots in the Knesset, but Likud (headed by Netanyahu) and the Blue and White party (headed by Gantz) have the most support by far.However, because no party has ever won an outright majority of seats and they’re not expected to this time, Gantz and Netanyahu’s parties have to ally with some of the smaller parties to form a coalition that would allow each of them to govern. But some of these parties may not win enough votes to meet the threshold to even enter the Knesset (3.25 percent of the national vote, or about four seats), which means it’s difficult to predict who, at the end of the day, will end up on top.There’s also another complicating factor: The leader of the party with the most votes doesn’t just become the next prime minister; Israel’s president (who is elected to a seven-year term by an absolute majority in the Knesset) ultimately decides who forms the next government. After all the votes have been counted, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will consult with the leaders of the winning parties and make a decision about who among them should be the next prime minister. That process could take about a week. The party leader who is chosen will then have six weeks to form a governing coalition. If they fail, another party leader takes over. In short, there are lots of scenarios that could play out on Tuesday. Which makes this election a nail-biter — one that could have ramifications for decades to come.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Why an Israeli comedian went viral in the Arab world,2022-01-29,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:A catchy Arabic satire, explained.It’s rare that an Israeli song goes viral in the Arab world, but such was the power of comedian Noam Shuster-Eliassi’s recent satire, “Dubai, Dubai.” Maybe it was because she crooned in flawless Arabic. More likely it was because of her biting punchlines about how Israel and the United Arab Emirates have in recent years normalized relations at the expense of Palestinians.For decades, Arab countries would not entertain diplomatic relations with Israel until the rights and self-determination of Palestinians under Israeli occupation were realized. But the Emirates, which had quietly developed economic and military connections with Israel, stridently broke with that convention. In 2020, the Trump administration shepherded the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic wins that Israel has signed with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. Boosters celebrated them as a breakthrough. It was the first time Israel had established new ties with Arab states since it made peace with the neighboring Kingdom of Jordan in 1994 and Egypt in 1979. “Dubai, Dubai” is among the most public and blunt examples of a satirist lampooning the deal, since the UAE doesn’t tolerate dissent and its power in the Middle East has stifled other public criticism. That’s how an Israeli number became an unlikely Arabic sensation.Shuster-Eliassi jokes that it’s easier for Israel to make peace with a country 1,500 miles away than Palestinians next door. “In Dubai, they forgot the siege on Gaza,” she sings. “How nice would it be if only all the Arabs were from Dubai.” Her Eurovision-style performance — with backup singers framed by spectacular aerial views of the Persian Gulf megalopolis — puts a catchy pop tune to incongruously sarcastic lyrics. “Dubai, Dubai” resonated. The song, written by Razi Najjar for a comedy show this month on Israel’s Arabic network Makan, was picked up by regional TV giant Al-Jazeera and Arab news outlets, and then traveled all over social media. Shares and retweets filled a void in the otherwise rich field of Arabic satire. Critics of the deal have noted that in the Abrahams Accords Israel merely formalized already existing contacts with autocratic governments, and the millions in those Arab countries had no say. Businessmen, social-media influencers, and some tourists now shuttle between Israel and the UAE, but this is a cold peace forged largely around the two countries’ shared anxieties about Iran’s regional power and interests in exchanging tech and financing. Polls suggests many Arabs oppose normalizing relations with Israel, but are afraid to express those opinions. But despite that antipathy and a textured history of Arab satire, relatively few jokes, cartoons, or memes about the Abraham Accords have appeared in Arabic media. Those who take a stand, like a Jordanian cartoonist who mocked the deal, have been censored or arrested, chilling further discourse. Much of this relates to the immense influence that the United Arab Emirates exerts across the Middle East, where many countries depend on its financial largess. Dubai, one of the Emirates’ seven nation-states, is a repressive absolute monarchy with regional power. So dissident voices in the Emirates and the country’s partners have largely been absent. “No one can say it directly, so this song gave everybody a chance to express how they feel about it without them actually saying it,” said Khalid Albaih, a Sudanese cartoonist who lives in Qatar. Shuster-Eliassi wants to draw attention to the dire situation in Palestine. “My Palestinian friends are suffering and we are suffering because of the situation here,” she told me. “In the course of history, I’m not going to be willing to be listed among the people who were just silent about these issues.”The Arab world has a long history of editorial cartoons and a rich legacy of satirists taking on the powerful, including humorists who have found ways to make fun of Israel and its policies without verging into anti-Semitic territory. But their relative quiet on this issue points to a larger trend.The red lines are hazy. The website Al-Hudood, the Arab answer to the Onion, has satirized the Emirates, but its authors remain anonymous. Though some cartoonists, especially Palestinians, have published strong barbs about the Abraham Accords, such perspectives have been denied the biggest media platforms of the Arab world. The global financial capitals of Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the UAE are synonymous with luxury, celebrity, and wealth. But neither are part of a democracy. The United Arab Emirates doesn’t have a free press or free speech; while the country recently reformed some aspects of its criminal and financial laws, there has been no political reform. In response to peacemaking with Israel, protesters took to the streets of the small kingdom of Bahrain, and Emirati exiles put together petitions and hosted seminars. “There was opposition to the Abraham Accords,” said Dana El Kurd, a scholar of authoritarianism at the University of Richmond. “But in the Emirates, it’s so effectively controlled that people can’t really speak up in opposition.”It’s basically illegal to mock Emirati leaders. Vaguely worded laws prohibit “disruptive propaganda intending to prejudice the public security, or to spread fear among people or to inflict damage to public interest.” Even April Fools jokes are off limits. The government has shut down spaces that had long fostered independent voices, such as student unions and Islamist groups. Activists, like the democracy advocate Ahmed Mansoor, sit in the country’s jails. Those who have denounced Emirates-Israel relations have faced consequences. After speaking out, poet Dhabiya Khamis was banned from travel. Last year, dissident Hamad al-Shamsi and other exiles established the UAE Resistance Union Against Normalization. The government then labeled them as “terrorists,” and the group cannot meet inside the country. “This fear-infused atmosphere imposed by the government has prevented Emiratis from expressing their real position on normalization with Israel,” al-Shamsi wrote. The risks are real for Emiratis, and jokes about the Abraham Accords have been restrained in other Arab countries, too. In August 2020, the prominent Jordanian cartoonist Emad Hajjaj drew a caricature of the Emirates exchanging peace for Israeli fighter jets. In the cartoon, a dove’s droppings land on the face of an Emirati who looks a lot like the Abu Dhabi crown prince. The image was considered illegal under Jordan’s counterterrorism law for “disturbing relations” with a partner country.After several days in jail during a Covid-19 surge in his country, Hajjaj was released, but the arrest nevertheless sent a strong message. Hajjaj told me that now he would not risk it again because the small country of Jordan depends on the Emirates financially and politically. “A Jordanian cartoonist criticizing Emirates will not be tolerated unfortunately,” he said. “You cannot criticize the government of the Emirates.He wishes that the “Dubai, Dubai” song could be broadcast throughout the Arab world. Shuster-Eliassi was anxious when I spoke with her. Right-wing Israeli members of the Israeli Parliament had issued a complaint against the TV network for airing “Dubai, Dubai,” and she said that due to complications at the channel, her skit for last Thursday’s show had been put on hold. She understands that the muted response to the Israel-UAE accords is in large part due to restrictions on expression. The song is subtitled in Arabic, English, and Hebrew, she says, to made sure it could reach everyone, especially “people who disagree with me” and those “who have critical thoughts about what’s going on, but they’re unable to say it.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"""I’m from Gaza. Watching violence descend on my home is tragic.""",2018-05-22,Vox,['Jehad Abusalim'],"Filed under:The message of the Gaza protests is that Palestinians are human beings.When I saw the “rest in peace” posts on his Facebook page, I felt sick. It was on social media where I first learned about the death of Palestinian community organizer Ahmed Aladini, a man from my hometown, Deir al-Balah, who, like me, lived in Gaza. Aladini was a human rights activist and community educator, and deeply respected by so many in my small town.Like many other Palestinians, Aladini participated in the Great March of Return, a movement signifying a new episode of resistance against 70 years of refugee homelessness, 50 years of military occupation, and 11 years of brutal blockade. Starting on March 30, Ahmed protested every Friday for almost seven weeks before he was shot dead near the Gaza fence last Monday. Aladini and I were part of a vibrant political conversation in Gaza. We agreed and disagreed, yet we all shared one goal: the freedom of our people. In our last conversation on Facebook, Aladini and I discussed the dream world we wanted to live in — a just reality, free of oppression and poverty. In his last words to me, Aladini said that “we [Palestinians] will keep paying the price until we are capable of producing the alternative, and then defend it until death.” Aladini was killed before he lived to witness this “alternative.” Deir al-Balah, where I grew up, is a small town 8 miles south of Gaza City. I moved to the US five years ago to start a PhD program in history, researching Arab and Palestinian intellectual writings on Zionism and anti-Semitism before the establishment of Israel. Like most expat Palestinians from Gaza, I lead a double life of teaching and working in the US while trying to stay up to date with news in Gaza on social media. The march brought mixed feelings of pride, hope, pain, and sadness. Last Monday, 60 people were killed as Israeli soldiers opened fire at Palestinian protesters near the fence. The “bloodbath,” as Sarah Leah Whitson, director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division, described it, was the result of the “policy of Israeli authorities to fire irrespective of whether there is an immediate threat to life on Palestinian demonstrators in Gaza.” Palestinians in Gaza have access to an average of four hours of electricity a day as a result of the unjust Israeli blockade imposed on Gaza since 2007. But in the brief time when they can plug in, Palestinians in Gaza have managed to turn social media spaces into vibrant platforms of political, cultural, intellectual, and even theological debate and discussion. I have stayed connected with these debates and discussions to defy distance. Since I left Gaza to pursue my graduate studies in the US, I haven’t been able to return, visit, and see my family and friends. Traveling to Gaza through Israel is almost impossible, especially for young Palestinians like me, while the risks of getting permanently stuck in Gaza should I cross the border from Egypt are high.The policy of Israeli blockade affects almost every aspect of people’s lives in Gaza. Traveling, even for the purpose of medical treatment or education, is almost impossible. Every day that passes in Gaza under the blockade is haunting. Unlike war, where violence is visible as bombs are falling, the blockade is like slow death. But siege and blockade take their toll: When people can’t have access to decent nutrition, electricity, clean water, and freedom of movement for political reasons, it’s no less violent than war itself. Monitoring the social media produced by Gazans has been a difficult task since the march began. Scrolling through Facebook profiles has become devastating — people post goodbye comments on your friends’ last posts or on their Facebook walls. These were people I knew. Now they are memories. Thankfully, their words that articulate the dream of rights and dignities never fulfilled will stay alive on social media. My neighbor Ahmed, like the rest of the participants in the march, knew that he might get wounded or killed every time he marched. Terrifying as this thought may be, it never crushes the spirit of uprising. And a brief sampling of what people in Gaza write on social media shows that they are aware of the consequences of challenging the might of Israel’s military machine. They are neither stupid nor suicidal, and they understand what could happen. But they also recognize that this is a battle that needs to occur for change to come. The idea of the march has been part of the political discussion in Gaza for years, and I witnessed it evolve. Contrary to Israeli propaganda, which claims that the march is staged by Hamas, participation in the march transcended factional and ideological affinities. The march was a product of Palestinian civil society efforts. In fact, grassroots organizers, young intellectuals, and activists struggled to renew Gaza’s confidence in peaceful and nonviolent mass mobilization as a tactic that would end their dehumanization by Israel. Yet despite all these efforts, official Israel and US messaging focuses on few violent manifestations in the march — which amounted to a small group throwing burning tires, Molotov cocktails, and stones, according to the Israeli military — and try to cast the incongruous words of a few marchers as nothing but Hamas propaganda. Such an approach not only dehumanizes Palestinians, it also assumes that they are nothing but mindless pawns of Hamas with no agency over their destiny and lives. Israeli demonization of the Great Return March is startlingly similar to the criticism of the American civil rights movement by its opponents in the 1960s. African Americans during the civil rights era did not (and still do not) all agree on tactics or a single ideology; some of them believed in armed struggle and even separatism while others were interested in electoral change. Does any of that take away from the validity and legitimacy of their central demand — freedom, equality, and justice? Are they not worthy of rights and dignity? Of course they are, and Palestinians in Gaza, who similarly advocate for a range of tactics and solutions, are trying to convey the same message. Their message is that we are human beings. Despite 70 years of exile, 50 years of occupation, and 11 years of a blockade, we still can carry signs in Arabic, Hebrew, and English that say, “We are not coming to fight — we are coming to return to our lands!” Gazans who saw wars and blood, who lost relatives to graves and prisons, who have four hours of electricity, who are besieged and tired — these Gazans still have faith that the international community cares. Will the rest of humanity hear them? Jehad Abusalim is a PhD candidate in history and Hebrew and Judaic studies and a policy analyst from Gaza. His writings have appeared in Al Jazeera English, Mondoweiss, and Palestine Square, and he recently contributed to a book on Gaza called Gaza as Metaphor.

Saudi Arabia reportedly saw Jared Kushner as an impressionable target,2018-12-08,Vox,['Rachel Withers'],"Filed under:There may be more to the relationship between Mohammed bin Salman and Jared Kushner than meets the eye, according to a New York Times report.As further details emerge about how Russian officials attempted to form connections with those in Donald Trump’s orbit for political influence, a new report indicates that Saudi Arabian leaders were making concerted efforts of their own, cultivating valuable connections with a key figure in Trump world: Jared Kushner.Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and one of his senior advisers, has formed a close bond with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — one that “did not happen on [its] own,” according to a New York Times report published Saturday. The detailed report, written by David D. Kirkpatrick, Ben Hubbard, Mark Landler, and Mark Mazzetti, tracks the story of how the two men in their 30s came to have such a close friendship that Kushner regularly chats privately on the phone with the crown prince, even calling him by his first name, much to the chagrin of senior American officials. The Times reports that Saudi Arabia saw Kushner as a viable, impressionable target, and began what the reporters describe as “the courtship of Mr. Kushner”:Prince Mohammed and his advisers, eager to enlist American support for his hawkish policies in the region and for his own consolidation of power, cultivated the relationship with Mr. Kushner for more than two years, according to documents, emails and text messages reviewed by The New York Times.A delegation of Saudis close to the prince visited the United States as early as the month Mr. Trump was elected, the documents show, and brought back a report identifying Mr. Kushner as a crucial focal point in the courtship of the new administration. He brought to the job scant knowledge about the region, a transactional mind-set and an intense focus on reaching a deal with the Palestinians that met Israel’s demands, the delegation noted.This delegation was followed up by a series of meetings and personal recommendations that Kushner reach out, including from MBS ally Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi. Though initially suspicious of Saudi Arabia’s motivations, Kushner soon put his concerns aside, drawn in by proposals and initiatives that aligned with his Israel-Palestine priorities and the administration’s anti-violent extremism ones.Senior government officials reportedly hold major concerns over the relationship, and if the report is accurate, they are probably right to. Three former officials told the Times that they felt Kushner was “susceptible to Saudi manipulation,” given his “political inexperience”: Senior officials in the State Department and the Pentagon began to worry about the one-on-one communications between Prince Mohammed — who is known to favor the online messaging service WhatsApp — and Mr. Kushner. “There was a risk the Saudis were playing him,” one former White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Efforts to impose rules and procedures ensuring National Security Council staff members take part in all calls with foreign leaders supposedly failed to make a difference, with the two men still chatting informally over call and text.Kushner’s close relationship with MBS has been helpful at times, but the connection is also believed to have fundamentally shaped US policy toward both Riyadh and the region. Council on Foreign Relations fellow and former Middle East envoy Martin Indyk told the Times that their “bromance” has shaped US policy toward the kingdom, including over its feud with Qatar and the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.The fresh scrutiny of the Kushner-bin Salman relationship comes in the wake of the October murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the CIA has since concluded was committed on MBS’s orders. Trump has refused to condemn the crown prince, while Kushner and the prince continue to chat informally, according to sources on both sides. According to the Saudi source, Kushner has even advised MBS on “how to weather the storm, urging him to resolve his conflicts around the region and avoid further embarrassments.” The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."

You’re listening to Recode Decode, a podcast about tech and media’s key players, big ideas and how they’re changing the world we live in. Today we’re gonna play an interview I conducted at South By Southwest in Austin, Texas. I talk to Christiane Amanpour, CNN’s chief international correspondent. We talked about journalism in 2018, the #MeToo movement and her new series, “Sex and Love Around the World.” Let’s take a listen. There’s so many people here, we don’t have mics [for the audience], and so any question you’d like, we’re ready to answer. [instructions on how to submit questions]Christiane Amanpour: Any question. Any question. We were just backstage and I was just thinking, this is about sex, which is good, because we’re in a particular naughty mood, possibly dirty. Right up to inappropriate, but we will not cross that line. Really? Okay. We can. All right. So tell me about this show. “Sex and Love Around the World” is not something I’d expect from you. No, I didn’t expect it from myself, either. You can imagine my bosses didn’t expect it either because I can synthesize North Korea and Russia and take all that stuff in and Iran and the Middle East and put it out in a palatable way for the viewers. But “Sex and Love” was much more of a voyeuristic journey. Was much more of a learning curve for myself as well. You’ve had sex, right? Occasionally. At least once. I have a kid. Right. Okay. Well. It was nearly 18 years ago. He’s gonna be 18 in March. Okay. So, yeah. I was learning a lot of new stuff on the road. Okay. Good. Okay. Which was great for me. I just wanna establish that. You never know. I have to be honest and authentic. So now you’ve completely thrown me off my game. That’s my job. That’s okay, Kara. Yeah. That’s my thing. You and I go back a long way. So where did you get this idea? I got the idea brushing my teeth at my sink getting ready to go to work, listening to a radio program about three years ago at the height of the Syria war and at the height of the crisis of all these refugees coming across from the bloodshed in Syria. And trying to find a place to live and to be dignified and civilized and continue their humanness, continue trying to be people. So you were listening to a radio program about the crisis in Syria and you thought, “Fucking.” Didn’t exactly think of it like that. All right. But what I thought was ...Because that wasn’t working for me. She really is going on crossing the line. Trying to drag me across it as well. Exactly. No. What I thought was, “Self, you have done all this extreme living, extreme reporting, extreme experiences, in the most extreme parts of the world in the most extreme circumstances. And you’ve watched and reported individuals cope with sniping and shelling, genocide and disease and famine and natural disasters. And you’ve told that story. You’ve been inside the humanity of people who’ve managed to stay sane or try to and alive, during those kinds of situations.” But as I was listening to this radio thing, I said the myself, you know, what about women and girls? What about how you live? How you maintain your dignity? How you maintain your intimate relations? How do you keep your partnership going? How does a mother keep her daughter safe and not off to some forced marriage? Do they talk about sex between mothers and girls in villages in Afghanistan or wherever it might be? So all these thoughts kept coming. And how do you do all that in a flimsy tent where everybody and their brother listen to you and see you and know what your business is? You had written about this issue of women. You’ve talked about it. You’ve reported on the Congo, for example. Okay. Yeah. But I haven’t done it in this way. Right. I’ve done it ... Rape as a weapon of war, for instance. Right. I reported that in Bosnia. I followed it to the international criminal court. It became a law. But I haven’t done it in this way where it was much more of, you know, you’re not going to see the victims. You’re not going to see the horrors. You’re not going to see the catastrophes in this series. And I did that deliberately along with ZPZ and Anthony Bourdain, CNN, and all those who we talked about this. This was much more a journey to see the flip side of what I’ve been doing all my life. Right. What their real lives were like. Yeah. What their real lives were like. Using the lens of love and sex. Which is also extreme in many, many cases. And what I found way before the #MeToo movement exploded — because I was shooting this months before that started — was that yes, there are many parts of the world where it’s very dangerous, very ugly to be a woman. But even in those parts of the world, younger women, women of the generation of many of you in this room, whether it’s in India, whether it’s in China or Japan or elsewhere, are taking their own rights. And you wanna know, literally, in a society that considers women less than human or second- or third- or fourth-class citizens, where women are slaves, where women literally don’t have the right to say, “Boo,” to a dog, how does a woman say to her husband, “You know that sex? I want to be satisfied too. I want to talk about this. I want to have fun. I want to be fulfilled. I want to be emotionally, spiritually, physically satisfied as well.” That is crucial for women all over the world in any socioeconomic demographic. And it was fascinating to watch the women who I’ve reported on — as I said, in the other way — to be talking about this. And the other thing that was fascinating was how open they were to talking. To talking about it.Men and women were really open to talking. I didn’t find anybody who clammed up and said, “No.” So the range of places you went. I was reading your thing, which made me laugh out loud last night. Which one?The essay you did about it. Oh, right. Yeah. You know, about hymenoplasty, which I really do need to ask about. Yeah. It went from Berlin,  where you had a bondage ... Yeah. I did a lot of things, naked Ping-Pong. Guys, that’s something to watch out for. You see, I’m an incredibly controlled human being. My eyes, straight. And it was all naked. Not me. Why not? Maybe, not me. Well, because I didn’t think I’d get it past the censors. Plus, I didn’t want to shock too many people. All right. Okay. So, naked Ping-Pong. Give me a range. So, bondage in Berlin. Which seems to go together. Well, it does. Berlin is known as the sex capital of Europe.It is. Right? It’s the edgy capital. It was really during Hitler’s time, they called it degenerate and all the rest of it. And they really, really have been ... They fought for that part of their culture for a long time, but you know, I found in 2017 that a lot of it is a little bit, sort of ... yoga. Performance art. But I ... I’m with you. I live in the Castro of San Francisco. Yeah. And a lot of it is not quite as edgy as I expected. So there I am very seriously trying not to be too voyeuristic watching these couples do their thing and there’s all this breathing and it’s about this and it’s about that. And all of a sudden, the guy comes up to me and he throws these ropes over me. And one of the things I’ve learned in my life, is when the awkward situations — we can talk more about this in regard to #MeToo — when there are awkward situations, I tend to pretend it’s not happening. So they throw ropes over you. And you’re like ... Yeah. Throw ropes around me. Here I am thinking, A) “I don’t look very good with the ropes the way they’re thrown around me.”They throw it on you? Or did they bind you? And then bound it. But not as tight as the others. No. Okay. All right. Okay. And then your reaction? My reaction, you’ll see. It’s a tease. Wow. I should have brought ... You’ll like it, Kara. Now I feel regretful that I didn’t bring my ropes. So you went there, but you also went to serious places like in India with marriage, forced marriages, for instance. So in India, who knew, but there’s also a flourishing kinky sector as well where there is BDSM. Obviously it’s not the majority of Indians, but a small group in New Delhi do it. But why was it so interesting? First for the visuals, because of the stories people told me as I was onstage. In any event, they were very interesting stories. But most importantly, they wanted to be absolutely clear that this is all about consent. There’s a safe word and woe betide you if you go across that line. But of course, that’s massively important too, because a month after I did that shooting — well, not physical shooting, but the shooting — came the Harvey Weinstein stuff, which was all about non-consent. Oh, we’re getting to there. So, yeah. It was, you know, unbeknownst to me, without an agenda of that type, it was unfolding before my eyes. And then many, many interesting things. You know, the DYN of the tech world. Who knew that in the Muslim world where women, as I said, are barely able to join the workforce, in the last decade, another 55 million women have joined the workforce? That’s a 155 million women and guess what? Their powering it. A lot of these entrepreneurs in their hedge jobs — not the men with the hoodies and this and that who we see here in the West. The women in their headscarves are pioneering a whole entrepreneurial tech employment for themselves and based on — this is what I read in the latest article I saw about it — something like a trillion dollars worth of disposable income that women in that part of the world have. So, it’s unbelievable. Like in Saudi Arabia and Iran, 38 percent of women are doing tech stuff. That compares to just 30 percent here in the United States. Right. Less than. Or less. As you would know better than I do. But it is remarkable. So the series is also about how women, wherever I went, are grabbing their rights as well. At the same time, it’s pretty depressing for women across the globe too. Did you try ... I didn’t do that side. I’ve done depressing all my career. You know? I mean, do you know what? It was actually nice to have a break from the depressing, from the crazy, from the frenetic, from the current political environment around the world and in the United States. It was quite nice to have a break and see a real slice of life that we often don’t focus on. This is not manufactured. This is not just a little elite group that I went to talk to. This is a real slice of life. What was the most surprising? I would say the most surprising was the generational difference, because you expect ... I mean, I didn’t know this, but I went there finding out what maybe a lot of people know, that Japan, for instance, is very, very sad when it comes to sexuality. Oh, yeah. Japan. Yeah. I mean, there are sexless marriages. There’s women who once they’ve had their children move out of the marital chamber, out of the bed, and go to be in the same bedroom as their kids. So their husband, who’s the office man — that classic title of male workers. [to Kara] Hey, man. Turn off your phone. I’m sorry. Just kidding. So, that was weird. I’m completely ignoring her. That was really, really weird to see that. To talk to some of these women who, honestly, honestly ... There’s a bar scene when I talk to about four or five women, and one of them almost has tears in her eyes. Talking about ... Yeah. When I ask if she’s happy and she’s not. Is she happily married? No, she hasn’t had sex with her husband in 10 years. Just this thing. And, you know, she’s found herself somebody and she’s happier. But can’t really talk about it because that’s not done. And then to find that younger women are trying to bust out ...To change this. To change this role. And then also to find that there’s a small group of people, men and women, who want to change this and have created, what was it? The Adoring Husband Society. Right. Where they yell, “I love you.” Where they actually yell, “I love you.”Right. And they actually make a big deal. It’s performance art. So, hopefully, life will follow art. And that’s what they do. So they show up in various public places and yell, “I love you.”Yes. Frankly. Yeah. And they’re doing things that you and I would take for granted. They’re not staying at work until 11:00 pm. They’re coming home at maybe 9:00 pm or 8:00 pm or 7 to have dinner with their wives and actually talk. Go play golf when they have disposable non-work time. Finding some hobbies. It sounds ordinary, but in that society, it’s completely extraordinary. So that was really fun and interesting. What about the U.S.? Did you do ...? No. We made a conscious decision not yet to do the United States. I don’t know whether we will, but we didn’t do the U.S.Why is that? Well, because this was around the world. I’m a foreign correspondent. I just wanted to ... I do want to do the U.S. and generally the West. But what you see also is almost from the East all the way to the West, catching up. So the West has been way ahead in their various sexual contexts. China, Japan, all those countries, Africa are catching up. For instance, in the West, women have much more economic freedom, economic independence, etc. And they have been trying to explore their own sexuality, their happiness, all of that, for a long time. In Shanghai, it’s only just starting, to the point that for many women, young women, millennial women, the concept of dating doesn’t even exist because for millennia in China it’s been arranged marriages. So, you know, you marry who your parents tell you to marry. And family is it. Family rules the roost. And the idea of dating and trying to make your own decisions is very novel. At the same time, China has — or rather Shanghai has — the highest concentration in the world of female billionaires and millionaires and that sort of thing. Right. Exactly. So they’re massively empowered. To do things. Yeah. So they have whole new economic sector called the dating sector. Where people are teaching young women, young men how to actually court and date. What was ... Explain this hymenoplasty. So that was in Lebanon. Lebanon. Okay.Because at the same time as women are ...Am I pronouncing that correctly? Hymenoplasty. Yeah. Should we explain what it is? No. No? You think it’s obvious. It sounds like what it sounds like. Yeah. It’s not a face lift, if you know what I mean. Okay. All right. It’s a something else lift. Okay. Explain that. So, here. Why is this important? It’s important because at the same time — and this is why women all over the world are so just hit by every bit of culture and the patriarchy — virginity is a must wherever you go. It’s a must, particularly in the Muslim world. So that even though they are losing their virginity, dating, doing all this kind of stuff before marriage, they have to be virgins at the wedding night. So there is a thriving business in hymenoplasty. In other words, sewing up so that you can appear to be a virgin on your wedding night. And actually, it was kind of, almost really sad because some of these girls are not used to dating. They’ve actually never slept with somebody, some of them who are not there for hymenoplasty but just for advice from this sex therapist. They have been told, it’s been drummed into them, whether it’s in India or Beirut or whatever, that, “Don’t sleep, don’t sleep, don’t sleep, you mustn’t go sleep with your boyfriend.” And then on your wedding, “You go to do it and have children.” Right? Got it. So they go from nothing to being expected to be machines in bed, right?Right. Right. At the same time, they’ve been told they have to value this thing that they have, which is their virginity. So these women, many of them are going to their marriages needing this therapy before they go because they don’t even want to lose their virginity to their husbands. Oh, wow. They have been told it’s so valuable. Right. Oh, wow. So there was a lot to talk about. What’s your favorite story? I have lots of favorite stories. You know, it’s like children. I can’t tell you that I have a favorite episode. I learned so much. As I said, I’ve gone out into the world and been experienced in all the other political ...Did it translate into your life? You know, it’s translating. Yeah. You know, my view of life is a constant lesson, learning all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. What would you do if you went to the U.S.? I mean obviously ...We are in the U.S. Go ahead. What? I’m sorry. Oh, you mean, to cover the U.S. C’mon. C’mon.Well, some of the stuff that Esther Perel has been talking about. You know, open ... You all know who she is, right? She’s the fantastic Ted speaker, sex therapist and psychologist who has great podcasts as well as great speeches. You see, in the West, you have couples who are bored. You have all the stuff that happens after long, long marriages. And you have this whole new thing coming out, open marriages. That seems to be a thing that’s being talked about now. Oh, it’s all over Silicon Valley. There you go. Well, you know more than I do. Silicon Valley. And when they start talking about it I’m like, “La, la, la, la, la. I don’t wanna hear about it.”So, everybody’s trying to figure out ... It’s all yours, Christiane. What I really want to do more than necessarily the West or whatever, I’d really like to explore this from a perspective of men and boys, because obviously this was done through my lens and exploring it through the perspective of women. But I’ve always been convinced — and this program made it more obvious for me — that we as women are not going to have totally satisfied lives, whether it’s in the bedroom, whether it’s in the work, whether it’s wherever it might be, unless men are on side with us, unless they also are liberated, to respect us as actually human beings. To enjoy us even and not to be intimidated and to be with us in this struggle, which is a once in a moment’s struggle, which we find ourselves in right now. Yeah. Let’s get to that because I think, you’ve taped this before and needless to say, you got your job because of your other job at PBS because of #MeToo, although, utterly ... I did. You did? Oh, yeah. So talk about that. I’m not gonna talk about the specifics of the individual, however.His name’s Charlie Rose. Okay. However, I’m going to tell you that with great pride as a competent woman, I have taken that spot or that slot, for the moment. Well, I’ll be honest, you should have had that slot. Well, whatever. I work for CNN. Thank you. But I’m proud of it. I’m glad they gave it to me as a woman. I’m glad. What happened? How did that occur? Well, I think ...We’ve got this issue with this Charlie Rose situation. Well, it’s the genius of my boss Jeff Soukas. So you have to ask him about it. He’s here in the audience? Yeah, he’s here in the audience. All right. Yeah. Well, we delivered a sterling product at a time when they needed it. Right. And we’ll see where it goes. What did you think when you heard about this? About what? Charlie.What did I think about the whole thing? No. What did I think about the whole thing? He’s one of many, right? That started at Fox News, that went on to Hollywood, that’s come now into journalism and other parts of our professional space, cultural artist, wherever. Sports. I mean, those female, American female gymnasts. It’s just a horror. It’s a horror. And I’ll tell you what I thought. I thought many different things and at different times. You know, I was shocked but not shocked, but I was shocked at the extent of it. I myself have not had that level of sexism and misogyny and harassment and abuse, by no means. I was horrified. I mean look, a few weeks before it happened at CBS and PBS, I was giving a speech at the Committee to Protect Journalism. I was hosting that evening, Meryl was there, she was a keynote speaker, Meryl Streep, it was great on behalf of freedom of the press. And I looked out and obviously the Harvey Weinstein thing was in full flow. And I looked out and I said to the men in the audience, I said, “We are your sisters. We are your friends. We are your colleagues. We are human beings. You have to help us. You can’t keep hurting us like this.” And then a few weeks later, this happened. But the thing is, as I say, we cannot do this without the support of our male relatives, our male bosses, our male friends, our colleagues, whoever it might be. This is not women against men, men against women. This has to be the beginning of a real joining at the hip to win this struggle once and for all. And nobody needs to point out that the more women, the more equality, the more parity, the healthier every aspect of society is, from the GDP of a nation, even like the United States, to your state, your city, your community, your workplace, your home, it makes a difference. And I tell you ... You might wonder why I’ve got this on my lap. So this is GQ, the British version, and on the cover is Naomi Campbell and a grime artist called Skepta. And I’ve got it because I wanted to read why they were on the front. Don’t tell me I’ve lost the page. Anyway, I’ve lost the page. But I tell you why I picked it up. I picked it up and read it throughout the flight to Austin. And I was so impressed by the articles, by the editor in chief’s article, by Skepta and Naomi’s interview, by all the guys that were writing articles for guys in this magazine, because they were sympathetic. They weren’t whining and crying about the backlash and snowflakes and I don’t know what else. They went, “Yeah. Yes, ladies. Yes, girls. This is your moment and this is the right time.” And yes, they may be a little over-egging of the pie. Maybe some people get caught up. But for a long time, this reckoning has been coming. And this has to be addressed, has to be addressed. Let me read you what Skepta says. He’s a young man, right? He’s like in his 20s. He basically said ... So, “Is there a pressure on a man to live up to a certain archetype of masculinity? was the question. He says, “I watch the National Geographic a lot. Even without the volume on. I just love watching animals because we’re animals. Sex is an urge. We want to have sex, but now people are just going to have to respect sex.” That’s pretty intense. That’s very profound. Right. Right. From a man’s point of view, a young man’s point of view. Okay? Where masculinity is all sort of wrapped up ... It’s kind of low bar. “Please don’t rape us.”No. No. This is not just about don’t rape us. This is about everyday sexism. No, seriously. This is also about everyday sexism, which has also been written about, but that’s the bar that many people, including myself, have had to deal with. When you said, “I was shocked but not shocked.” What does that mean? Because you know what’s going on. I mean, I don’t know the details, but as I said, there’s everyday sexism.Right. So you see it. There’s a continuum. Correct. Like, “Why don’t you smile?” “Don’t you look pretty?” to the ... But not just that. How often am I the only woman in the room? A lot. Yes. Yeah. Right? How often am I asked what it’s like to be a woman war correspondent? When I thought I’d won that battle in 1990 at the Gulf War. But they’re still asking us. What do you answer now? I say we’ve won that battle, but now we need to move up to the executive suite. Right. Right. When women are in positions of power to make these decisions about women and men, it’ll be different. I think we both have sons, right? I have two sons. You have one son. Why is it up to women to clean it up? That to me gets ... Who said that? I just said it’s up to all of us. It’s up to all of us, but the idea is when women are in power. Why can’t men in power do it now? No. It’s not that. It’s when you have parity. Right. It changes the dynamic around the table. That’s all I’m saying. Parity changes something. You know? It’s not just a empty word. Equality is not an empty word. It changes the dynamic. It changes the flavor. Even in peace processes. Do you remember the ... Well, the first two female, Nobel laureates around a peace accord was in Northern Ireland. It was two women who ages ago in the ’70s, way before there was a peace process. But women also pushed that process. If you look between Israel and Palestine right now, the Israelis have a very strong female contingent of peace warriors, if you like, who have their like-minded sisters on the Palestinian side. It’s not got anywhere yet, but they are there pushing this agenda. If you look at Liberia, years and years of warlordism and dictatorship and dreadful stuff. It was the wonderful Lama Boie about whom “Pray the Devil Back to Hell ...” It’s fantastic. Go and see it. They did the Greek mythological thing. They withheld sex from their men until there was a peace accord around that table as well as many other things. Then, they banded together and elected and made sure the first woman was elected president — this was eight years ago — of an African nation and of that nation in particular. And it made a difference. A hundred percent. One of the things ... I just interviewed Sheryl Sandberg at an event in San Francisco called Lesbians Who Tech, of all things. It was great. Lesbians who do what? Tech. Tech. We’re gonna bring you there next week to talk about sex. But we were talking about that idea of what happens now about the backlash. And one of the things she said is it’s not enough to stop the sexual harassment, which should be the lowest bar. It’s pay parity.Well, that. It’s power parity, which she was worried about is it stops at everybody just talking and stopping one thing that shouldn’t be happening. No. One of the things I talked about on my program for PBS and for CNN International are this last week when it was International Women’s Day, was that I actually went over and talked to women ... Not went over, but by satellite, women ... an Egyptian American activist and also an Afghan female member of Parliament. And while they’re still fighting for basic rights, we here in the West, we have our rights. They are enshrined. They’re just not enforced. We have our rights. Like every organization has its HR policy. Just got to enforce it. Anyway, I’ll come back to that in a minute. But what we still don’t have in the West is equal pay for equal play. And that is another massive thing that we have to achieve. It is under no circumstances okay for a man to be paid more than a woman for doing the same job or doing a lesser job. Of course. Under no circumstances. Except ... No. No except ... No, not except. Except it just happens. Well, right. But we’re at the moment now. What has to happen? Tell us about this moment. More women in the executive suite, maybe.Tell us about this moment, because what do you imagine happening? There is a pushback. There is a backlash. You know? But the backlash is not as hard as the momentum moving forward. I don’t believe it is. Really? Yeah. I don’t believe it is. And we’ve got to keep it moving forward. To be honest with you. We have to take our destiny in our own hands. We really do. It’s like the young kids who decided to do what they think is the right thing after the shooting in Parkland. It’s like the women who decided to march. It’s like what’s going on now. When you see basic injustice and rights under threat, it is up to us to become engaged. We cannot sit back lazily and say, “Oh, we’ve won. We’ve done everything. Everything’s cool. We live in this rich society.” No. The massive equality gap that keeps widening in our society is really unacceptable. Even the last time I was onstage and I spoke — it was actually in New York, it was a Ted sort of event and it was about false news — and I said, “We have to be responsible. You have to be responsible for going to the right places to get your news information.” You know? You can’t just blame the bots. You can’t just blame the Russians all the time, although they’re very, very much engaged. We have to be responsible for what we are searching, what we’re reading, what we’re watching and what we’re synthesizing in our brains. I mean, I guess you saw it, Twitter has funded a major investigation or whatever they call it at MIT and they just came out with their results. That something like ... I’m gonna get the actual stats probably mixed up but it’s something like 70 percent more false news gets repeated than real news. Yep. And the other thing they found out was that it wasn’t bots, it was humans. Because human beings actually maybe gravitate to something that sounds so extraordinary and then they want to share it. Well, if it sounds so extraordinary, it probably is because it is extraordinary. And it’s not true. But it does begin with these ... I’ll get to the idea of that at the same time, whether you have to be responsible when you’re inundated with social media, when it’s part of your ... Facebook being, I think, biggest. Jeff talks about it a lot, that these people are culpable for the systems they built, that created the situation. And that’s true. And that’s true. When you say you should be responsible. But sometimes it’s confusing. It’s loud. Of course it is. But we ... Look, we’re in an existential moment now. We are at peril and at risk if we don’t know the difference between truth and lies. Truth and lies are the only thing that separates us from democracy and dictatorship. And we have to know. We have to know. So, how does an average citizen do that? I say read ... You know, watch CNN. Read the New York Times. Go on Recode Decode. And just go to places where you know are trusted sources of fact. Fact, fact, fact, fact. That’s what I’ve been doing my whole career. Except that you have such a partisan situation that it’s not ...Yeah. That’s a problem. You have a U.S. president that ... That’s a problem. What is it? “The failing New York Times.” “The lying CNN.” You know, do we really believe it?I think a lot of people do. Maybe they do, but we still have to keep up the fight. Right. We still have to keep fighting. What is the option, Kara? We’re gonna sit and just, “Okay”? No. No. Not the option. But how do you ... Jeff’s talked about regulating the ...And he’s right. So tell me about that. Well, you know, there has to be a code of conduct. Just like there’s a code of conduct around personal politics and sexual harassment and all the rest of it. There has to be a code of conduct around what gets put out on what are media platforms. Let’s not beat around the bush anymore. These are media platforms. If we’re bound by certain rules and regulations, then they should be bound as well. And you know what? What about something ... I don’t know, I’m really asking you now. I don’t know the solution. But what about something like the so-called Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval? What about a whole industry cropping up. I know they’ve tried it in bits and bolts.They have. Yes. But a whole serious sector, which can put the stamp of approval on what’s real and what’s not. And I think that’s really important. But let’s not kid ourselves that fake or false news is a Trumpian development. It’s not. This has been going on since time immemorial. It’s true that the President of the United States has used it as a weapon to bludgeon us from the White House, the most powerful purge in the world. And has therefore, maybe, lowered the bar of what’s acceptable in terms of treating journalists and treating fact as opposed to fiction. And has also empowered and enabled the worst kinds of leaders around the world who have no respect for independent journalism or the truth. Right? So, that’s all a problem. Okay. So now we understand that. Now, we have to just keep up the good fight. And we all need to be implicated in this. We all need to be involved in this. And we can’t have ... And I think they are starting to change. You tell me, is it enough? The Zuckerbergs and the Googles. I don’t know. I cannot get them to say they’re media companies. Why not? They just won’t. I did interviews with [YouTube’s] Susan Wojcicki, who’s terrific.That’s pathetic. I said are you a media ... “You are a media company.” And she said, “We’re a tech platform who facilitates media.”But it’s just bullshit, isn’t it? Yeah. Well ... And it’s just lies. I do think they do think of themselves as a benign platform. And I think, I’m more worried ... It could be. Right. But they have to ... Look, when you’re under attack, you have to figure out how to get out of the hole and to fortify the boundaries. I don’t understand why they keep saying that. And why they just keep letting stuff happen to them. I mean, how much bad publicity can they take? How much devastating consequences do they want to be blamed for? Right. To me, it’s a weird business model. I don’t understand it. You’d think that the first thing they’d do is clean it up. Clean it up. Right. They’re the analysts. Aren’t they the brilliant techie minds? These guys have the wherewithal to do it — and they are mostly guys. Maybe there should be more women, Kara. Yes. Well ... Welcome to my world. You think you know a lot of men? I know a lot of men. And then ended up having two sons. It’s just astonishing. But isn’t it extraordinary, that the STEM subjects are much more ... It’s extraordinary. The proportion of young women in colleges, universities, in these majority Muslim countries are studying STEM much higher than here in the West. Yeah. It’s really quite impressive. It’s incredible. There’s lots of reasons. That’s a whole other thing to go into. But I want to finish up with this part because one of the problems around the fake news has to do with internationally. Where here it’s a little noisier and there are people who are a little more educated about media, in the Philippines, in certain countries it gets super dangerous. Yeah it does. I mean, the Philippines is not a good example because you have a crazy strong man. But if you go to France, for instance, the new it-man of international politics is Emmanuel Macron. He’s the it-man? I think he is. He’s really out there with a vision. With the courage to campaign and to win from the center. He was under sought from an extreme right, anti-Semitic, racist party called the National Front. And many opponents trying to win would go towards their, rearrange their politics for the moment, he did exactly the opposite, and he won from the center. And not only that, he had a group of his tech group and his digital media people knew the Russian threat and all the rest of it and they had a plan. They actually had a plan. And they beat back the Russians on this. Right. And that was really smart. And in Germany, they’re doing the same thing. In Britain, the Prime Minister has introduced speeches in Parliament how the government actually now does have to take a stand. This is an assault. It’s soft power, but it’s an assault. It’s a cold war of a different type. Yeah. Not in this country, though. The mud-slinging hasn’t happened. Well, no, but it should. Well, yes. It should. It should. But how does that occur? I don’t know. I’m not American. I don’t cover American politics. But I’m telling you that it’s possible. Yeah. So it has to happen. There needs to be a really ... Leaders like Jeff, others in the media who feel that our facts are being compromised by their lies and their enabling of it. All of that. There just needs to be united we stand, divided we fall. Right. And that’s often been a problem in the media industry in the United States. Not enough unity and brain power and force of all the presidents getting together and saying, “This is now what we have to do.”So you’re not covering politics, but you’re affected by it as the international ... First of all ...I cover the way ...What does that do? Because CNN is attacked by the president most. I think you guys get the most ...Yeah, we do. Right up there. Yeah. Does that affect your coverage? How do you look at that?I don’t think it affects my coverage at all because we absorb it, report it, and keep sticking with the substance, and I spend a lot of time talking to world leaders about how it’s changed. What is it like dealing with this kind of presidency. What are your observations on what dealing ... Like, right now.Well, I would say that ... I mean, it’s nothing new, but a lot of people have absorbed ... A lot of world leaders and governments have absorbed the Trump factor. So they’ve learned how to read the tweets, listen to the speeches, but watch what actually happens and base their policy around what actually happens. So let’s just take the latest, which was the tariffs. So, from Europe, the answer was, “Let’s wait and see.” But — and this is, I’m quoting now the head of the European Commission — Jean Claude Juncker said, “You know, if the U.S. can do stupid, we can do stupid and we’re gonna have to do stupid.”Oh, that’s great policy. I know. But I thought it was great crazy policy too, however, guess why they do it. Take the Putin invading Crimea model. You don’t stand up to this stuff and the whole field is open for more incursion, more attack, more this. Right. So they’re saying, if we do nothing over the steel tariffs, if we do nothing, what’s gonna come down the pike at us? We have to. This is my point. We have to, no matter how ridiculous it sounds, stand up against these incursions, whether it’s fake news incurring into our sphere, whether, whatever, governments decide how to react to tariffs and this and that. So, you know, Eugenes, Harvey Davidsons, peanut butter, but then two days later, you hear, “Well, maybe we’re going to exempt our friends from these tariffs.” So what I’m saying is people are mostly now reacting to what the presidency does rather than what it said. But the saying is still very discombobulating. Yeah. And really. I haven’t noticed. But I’m speaking from the other side of the pond. I don’t even know what it looks like from there. What does it look like from there? You know. What? Different. Different? And? Well, different, Kara. I need a more descriptor. Okay. Well, I mean look. I’m used to reporting on American leadership in the world. Right? Whether it’s military, whether it’s soft power, whatever it might be. And now we’re dealing with an administration that appears to say that it doesn’t, is not interested in those kinds of historic American leadership models. That it’s all about America First and economic nationalism and this and that. And people are concerned, because if America doesn’t lead, who’s gonna lead? China? Yes. Yes. Not Russia. China. Do we want to live in a China-led, a China prism of the world? And actually, this is the most interesting thing about what happens in a North Korea, United States dialogue, because some analysts believe that this is the moment, depending on what President Trump does, depending on what’s on the negotiating table, that North Korea can start really driving the wedge, not just between the U.S. and South Korea, but fulfilling China’s greatest hope, which is to decrease the American presence in all aspects, particularly military, in Asia and the Pacific. And that’s something they’re gonna be very careful about, the United States, in these negotiations if they go ahead. I don’t think there was any preparation, from what I can garner. Right? It’s just like, “Hey, let’s do it.” Yeah. How did that go over, internationally? Well, you know, it led the news. Yeah. Well, okay. We don’t know. We don’t know. Is it gonna happen? Is it not gonna happen? They say it. Then they walk it back. Then they say it. So we’ve got to wait and see. Look, what we know, Kara, I don’t know how it’s gonna go down. But there are plenty of North, South Korea experts. They don’t happen to inhabit the Trump administration. Right. Because there is not a U.S. ambassador to South Korea. The state department official who’s in charge of the DMZ and all this north-south stuff and U.S. stuff retired, gone. There aren’t the ... There isn’t the structure to deal with this kind of thing right now. But there are many American officials under George W. Bush, under Bill Clinton, who have in the past been in these negotiations and could offer a massive amount of expertise if the administration wants to take it. So there are people. We did hear a week or so ago that if there was to be some kind of engagement, the Trump administration might go out of house to try to find a freelance North Korea expert. Right.So that is already being put around. So, Dennis Rodman, then. No. And don’t even joke about that. I am not. I don’t want this group to joke about this. This is the difference between nuclear war and potential ... I agree. I’m not joking. Yeah. No. It’s not gonna be Dennis Rodman. Okay. And if it is, nothing’s gonna happen. You know, it was Anthony Scaramucci. We were surprised by that. Like, “No.” Who I’ve met since. He’s quite charming. But here’s the thing. This is the very important thing. Right. Look, the truth is that North Korea has actually done something pretty incredible. It said that, “We will freeze ballistic missile testing, we’ll freeze nuclear testing. We don’t even mind and we understand for the moment, that the U.S. and South Korea are allied militarily. That there will be military exercises and this and that.” Which they’ve always minded about, but for this moment, they’re saying, “We understand it.”But the real fact is they — while all this negotiating, bombastic stuff has been going on over the last 20 odd years — they have now pretty close to perfected what it means to be a nuclear weapons power with a delivery system intercontinental ballistic missiles. So, what are they gonna give? And what is the United States gonna give? That’s why it’s so different today than when I covered it and went to North Korea in 2008. Are you surprised by him moving from the bombastic stuff to this? No. I’m not surprised, because he ... Who? Which one, by the way? Trump.Oh. I thought because the other one was equally bombastic, Kim Jong-un. Right. Which one’s more bombastic? They’re both equally bombastic. All right. Okay. But look, President Obama, if we’re to believe what was reported, told President Trump, “Your most difficult and important challenge will be North Korea.” I’m sure that went in. Just like George W. Bush said to President Obama, “Iran is going to be your most important challenge.” And I would just say one thing. Sometimes Americans can be too cute. They believe negotiations is a zero-sum game. That we have to win everything and you have to lose everything. That will never work. Especially with a developed North Korea as we know right now. Which is why the Iran Nuclear Deal was important. Not perfect, but important, because it involved negotiations, which meant that we had to give something in order to get something. And what we got was nuclear security for a period of years. They’re gonna have to accept that with North Korea, they’re gonna have to give something as well as take something. And for those purists who insist that negotiations are a sign of weakness, nothing will happen if that carries on. Wow. Because this is an incredibly nuanced and complex president. Very, very, very. And not only that. This is not a president who thinks like that. You have allies like Japan. I mean, the last thing between George W. Bush and Kim Jong-il, his father, sort of collapsed. Well, I mean the guy died, Kim Jong-il. Right. But before that, Japan was being very hard-lined on issues of reparations and the kind of stuff that emerged from their historic war with North Korea. Japan was actually a spoiler in that regard at that time. So there’s so many different angles that you have to get on board. It’s not just two leaders talking to each other. It’s everybody around. And at the same time, South Korea, which is really an important player, is potentially going to be hit by U.S. steel tariffs. Right. Yeah. You know, that’s a problem. Yeah. When I spoke to the key South Korean national security adviser, just around the Olympic games, they were pleased that President Trump at least publicly supported and the administrator supported the South Korean plan of trying to move forward diplomatically. Yeah. Are you hopeful? Because then I wanna get back to sex. Yeah. I don’t know yet. No?  No. I’m always optimistic, though. Are you? Not me. All right. There was one here. This is question from [the audience]. “Do women in places you visited talk about orgasms with their daughters or each other?”Not many of them. But for instance, in Berlin, in the episode that I did in Berlin ...Which? The bondage one or the other? No. Well, there’s an episode, it has different scenes. Okay. In one of the scenes, you had ... Because here you’ve got a Western culture, very open and very equal, that’s dealing with a massive influx of refugees from the Muslim world, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, all of that kind of stuff. And they are having to teach these men how to behave respectfully and equally to women, including sexually. And we sat in on a lesson that a young German woman was giving to these equally young Syrian men. And they literally didn’t even know what the word orgasm meant, and they didn’t know that woman had them. So there was a lot of talk about how to recognize, respect, do all that. So what was their reaction when they found out? They were, “Really?” Yeah. Their reaction was ... “You got to see this. This is hilarious.” So, the teacher had props and things and was showing them various things like the anatomical position of various features. And when ... They love use of the penis, right? When they were asking about orgasms, they said, “Should we practice this now too?” And the teacher was absolutely, “No, no, no, no, no. You don’t go out and just go practice this. You have to have consent.” So there was a whole nother round of questioning. It was really sweet, actually. A lot of it is very eye-opening.Yeah. One of the things that I was just stunned by, was this wonderful ... One of the top models in Germany is an Afghan refugee. She came 10, 15 years ago. She’s this beautiful woman, young 20s. Really beautiful. And she took Claudia Schiffer’s place as the face of Germany. Really amazing that this happened there. But she introduced me to new Afghan refugees, of whom I was asking quite difficult questions about sex, about happiness, about ... Literally, the young woman refugee, 20-odd years old, 23, pregnant with her third child, I mean, her eyes just got bigger and bigger and the horror on her face. And she said, “Nobody has ever talked to us like this before.” And my Afghan translator model said, “I’m telling you that these conversations with certain people are flat-out dangerous,” in that they have never, ever talked about their own personal happiness, much less their own sexual fulfillment.That’s amazing. But their daughters will grow up with a complete — here in Germany — with a completely different personal experience. Sure. I love the whole idea of Christiane Amanpour being the ambassador of orgasm around the world. All right. “Obviously, the culture in America surrounding dating and sex is deeply messed up. Who should young Americans be emulating? Is anyone doing it right?”You mean in the world? Yeah. Crikey. I don’t know. Emulating. Not the French? C’mon. No. The French also have their issues. Yes. They do. How about their backlash against #MeToo? Yeah. Like, “Oh, this is going to ...” Mind you, it was only a small group of people led by a previous generation of famous people, famous actresses. But the French have a massive spike, of all the developed countries, the French have the highest rate of infidelity. Yeah. That’s a shock. Yeah. Well ... And the highest rate of not thinking it’s a moral issue.Right. And then they also have this, “Oh my goodness. What is this gonna do to flirting?” and this and that. You know? No. I don’t necessarily think the French are models. I think everybody, an amalgam of women all ... To be honest with you, I think the young women coming up now are models because they are absorbing ... And this is why the internet is also good for them. I’m not talking about porn, okay, because we didn’t go into that. Everybody does porn. We didn’t do porn. Everybody does ... But they do. Love that quote. Every time you see sex on television, if you do, it’s about porn. Right. So we studiously stayed away from it. Or sexting. Or sexting or all the other things. We did a tiny little bit, not much. Tiny bit of sexting. Okay. Good. Okay. But these women in wherever, in the Arab world, in the Far East, in Africa. We had a great experience in Africa, too, in Ghana. It’s incredible. From the sassy older women to the really wonderful younger women coming up. Even in a city, Accra, that calls itself the most religious city in the world. I mean, every time you stumble out of a shop or your hotel or whatever it is, there’s a church or a mosque or some kind of temple on the sidewalk. But nonetheless, they’re still very active about their own personal space and their own personal life. Speaking of that: “What will it take to convince mainstream Americans their personal morals are not universal?”Well, I mean, America First. What can I tell you? You know, America’s got to get used to the fact that it’s a major leader in every aspect, but not every aspect is emulatable. Not at all. So what will it take? Don’t know. Okay. All right. Because you don’t live here. You know what it’ll take? What? Okay. See, I knew you knew. It’ll take more story telling. All right. It’ll take more stories of just ordinary things around the world to come into the space here. Right. And I think that’s really important because a country as important as America and as powerful — it is still the dominant country, although China is literally, as you know better than I do, in every regard, military, economic is coming up. And they’re good in sex too. No? Yes? They’re learning. Told you. They’re learning about dating. Dating. Okay. Getting there. Their minds are open. But, look. This is a massive continent. They don’t need to travel. They don’t really need to know about the rest of the world, except they do. Right. Because there’s tons of stuff that’s happening out there that’s actually kind of interesting, kind of eye-opening. Yeah. More storytelling from around the world. Storytelling. Just like this program. So, “What’s the most important thing you learned in 35 years at CNN?” I tell you, first of all, I’m incredibly proud. Maybe for the young people, I would just say that there’s real currency in starting at the bottom of the ladder with a dream and, whether you’re a man or a woman, and moving up to achieve your dreams. What was your bottom? I was a desk assistant. Literally, the peon of the peon. Yeah. I delivered mail at the Washington Post. There you go. I delivered Twinkies to my boss and some coffee sometimes. And I will tell you a secret. My first boss was a woman who pissed all over my expectations and dreams. It wasn’t obvious. No. She wasn’t very ... Most of my mentors were men. Yeah. Mine too. Which was great, actually, because it was great. And now I’m disappointed that a woman wasn’t as encouraging as I would hope. And I’m very encouraging to lots and lots of young women and men. But I think what I really love is that I started at a startup. CNN was a startup in 1980. By the time I got there in 1983, it was still kind of a startup. You know, all the people of my ...Ted Turner. Yeah. Well, Ted Turner is a hero in my view. He’s an American hero, an American original. He is revolutionary. He is. You know, cable changed the world. Cable did something. It democratized information. It democratized news. Not just here in the United States, but around the world when we went international. Countries that only had state-sponsored news and information, suddenly if you had a satellite dish or whatever you could, you could see CNN. You could see that there was other possibilities from around the world. It seems quaint right now, but this was in 1980 and then ’90 and etc. And it did actually change the world. And I love being in a place that ... We’re always complaining of the demise of TV and the demise of ... Look at us. Look at us. This is CNN’s moment. And we’ve had many moments. But after a trough, this is like a major, major moment. And I think people rightly look at us and know that they’re gonna get the facts and they’re gonna get the news and whether they’re here in the United States or around the world today, this is a major, major important bit of currency. Very, very important. And so I think that’s fantastic. How do you look at the cable scene? Because some of it’s screamy. Well, some of it is. Of course it is. But not everything. You don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater, in my view. Time for two more quick questions. “Were there any global trends you saw when it came to women in ‘Love and Sex Around the World?’” Any global trends? Yeah. I think the global trend is the young people are bursting out of the confines of their culture, of their context, of their religious mores, and it’s a story — and particularly young women. This, I think, is the most important thing I learned because, anecdotally, I’ve picked up in many places that I’ve been to that over the last decade or so, women make up more than 50 percent of university students in let’s say Iran or Saudi Arabia or wherever it is, in the places you’d least imagine. This whole #MeToo movement in the West, is happening as it’s quietly been happening around the rest of the world. Not defined by #MeToo but by education, by economic empowerment, by pushing through. By no means is it settled. And obviously over there, they do worse off than people over here. But they’re still pushing and pushing the boundaries. And you will see that the future in many of these countries will be built on the back of women. And it’s a dramatic shift, a dramatic cultural shift. And I hope that it’s one that ... And so that’s what I saw in the bedrooms when I was doing this program. Right. And in the bars, in all these other places where I went to talk to women and young men. The great thing about my son’s generation, he’s about to be 18, is the level — and all of you who are young people — have a level of tolerance and acceptance of gender and the relationship between men and women than, certainly, my generation and the previous generations had. And I think that’s really, really important. Absolutely. So the final question I have. There’s a lot of others here, but, “If you had to give, Christiane Amanpour, a piece of sex advice to this group?”I don’t think my team can handle it. No? No. I think I’m just not gonna. One? She’s gonna handle it. You know, I hadn’t prepared for that question. Okay. Know your rights, especially if you’re women and if you’re men, respect your partners, respect the girls. Old-fashioned courtship is gonna come back. Christiane Amanpour. [applause]This article originally appeared on Recode.net."
"The death toll from Gaza, explained",2023-11-01,Vox,['Keren Landman'],"Filed under:Real-time fatality counts from conflict zones like Gaza are almost never right. Pay attention to them anyway.At a press conference on October 25, PBS Newshour reporter Laura Barrón-López asked US President Joe Biden a stark question. More than 6,000 Palestinian deaths had been reported in Gaza since October 7, she said. Did this suggest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was ignoring Biden’s message to avoid civilian deaths?In his response, Biden questioned whether the fatality numbers, which came from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health, accurately captured the reality on the ground. “I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,” he said. Biden’s remarks were met with intense anger by some commentators who found them overly dismissive of death and suffering; others noted Biden’s own administration has been relying on those figures internally throughout and before the conflict. Two days later, in an unusual move this early in a conflict and seemingly in response to Biden’s remarks, Gaza’s Ministry of Health released a list containing the names and identity numbers of the nearly 7,000 people it says have died in the conflict so far. Historically, the Gaza Health Ministry’s figures have been found largely accurate. News organizations, human rights groups, and international governments and bodies (including the United Nations) cite them in the moment; and human rights groups that have worked to verify the ministry’s data in previous conflicts have found it generally reliable. Vox reports these figures, as it reports the Israeli government’s stated death tolls.For those occupying a grim corner at the intersection of political science and epidemiology, lists like these are just the beginning. “When we’re in the midst of something, it’s really, really hard to know” exactly how many have been killed, said Therese Pettersson, a senior analyst and research coordinator at the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), a Swedish organization that has been gathering and publishing verified data on conflict-related fatalities for 40 years and is seen as one of the world’s most reliable sources on these types of figures. “As time passes, information will become better.”  She says the reality is that in the early days of a conflict, fatality numbers are incredibly important, incredibly politically powerful — and, unfortunately, incredibly hard to get right. Gazan health officials, for example, have cautioned that death tolls will likely grow, given the number of people trapped under rubble. Pettersson and other experts in this space urge people to try to balance a few truths when it comes to fatality figures reported during conflicts: Early figures are often inaccurate, and can be exaggerated for political reasons. At the same time, they give us a crucial sense of the devastating scale of loss. In previous conflicts, for instance, the UN has found Gazan health officials’ toll accurate within 4 percentage points. And while a more precise understanding of a violent conflict’s true death toll will emerge in time, one thing is already clear: There is widespread death and suffering in Gaza as a result of the bombardment and fighting.Biden didn’t explain why he questioned the Gaza Health Ministry’s estimate of the conflict’s death toll, although it’s possible his remarks were related to what happened after an explosion at the al-Ahli Hospital on October 17. Even if it was not directly related to Biden’s comments, the incident at least shows how easy — and consequential — it is to make erroneous estimates and attributions around deaths related to individual incidents in the midst of a war. In the hours following that event, news outlets worldwide reported that Israel was responsible for the blast and that it had killed more than 500 people, attributing the information to Gaza’s health ministry. But in a matter of hours, that became hotly disputed. Israel released new evidence alleging that an errant rocket from Hamas-aligned terrorist organization Palestine Islamic Jihad had caused the disaster. A rare US statement on intelligence-gathering sided with Israel; in the days since, news organizations have cast doubt on at least some of the evidence and continued to scrutinize the cause of the explosion.Meanwhile, US estimates — although low-confidence — suggested the death toll from the hospital explosion was between 100 and 300. The health ministry’s revised final death toll was 471. The episode has been cited as a potential outlier in the health ministry’s general reliability.But as investigative journalist David Zweig reported in a recent edition of his newsletter, the “500 deaths” figure is actually a misquotation of the health ministry and the likely result of some mistranslated Arabic and a game of journalistic telephone. This is all to say: There were a lot of sources of uncertainty during this incident. Omar Shakir of Human Rights Watch, which has been monitoring human rights abuses in Gaza for three decades, told the Guardian the group has “generally found the data that comes out of the ministry of health to be reliable.”As one of the parties involved in the conflict, Hamas would arguably be incentivized to claim a large number of civilian casualties due to Israeli strikes (more on that below). However, the group has less control over Gaza’s Ministry of Health than it does over political and security agencies in Gaza, according to an Associated Press report. Health ministry employees come from a mix of factions, including Hamas but also the secular nationalist Fatah party, and some are independent. Hamas does not pay their salaries, nor, they say, does it influence the casualty figures they report.Pettersson said that, historically, the UCDP has trusted Gazan authorities — “but we have also been able to verify their reports with, for example, reports from [the human rights information organization] B’tselem or other types of news reports.” But at the moment, there’s scant news media coverage happening within Gaza due to low electricity supplies and communications services, as well as the danger of working in the area. While there is limited cross-referencing from independent media, what does exist confirms widespread suffering. AP reporters, for instance, have “viewed large numbers of bodies at the sites of airstrikes, morgues and funerals.” Notably, Israeli fatalities due to this conflict have been covered to an extraordinarily fine degree of detail by many different media outlets, making its casualty numbers much easier to corroborate, said Pettersson. The imbalance of information may be due in part to the imbalance in functioning communication infrastructure — Israel’s is still working, while Gaza’s has been fragile or, at times, completely out (a 34-hour communications blackout last weekend was blamed on a shutdown of phone and communication by Israel). It may also be related to the fact that while active violence leading to death has for the most part stopped in Israel, it remains ongoing in Gaza. An additional factor: Working as a journalist in Gaza is both currently and historically more dangerous than it is in Israel, due to frequent air attacks and Hamas’s history of harassing and using violence against journalists who attempt to report on its activities. At least 30 journalists have been killed in Gaza since this most recent conflict began, many in Israeli airstrikes.Whatever the reasons, the result is that Israel’s casualties have been easier to verify down to the individual than Gaza’s.Fatality numbers released early in the course of violent conflict are often inaccurate, said a number of experts who spoke with Vox. That’s partly because they’re hard to get. Violent conflict often destroys much of the infrastructure that would normally make it possible to reliably count deaths, said Paul Spiegel, a physician and director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Morgues and health care facilities, generally important sources of reliable casualty information, may be understaffed or too physically damaged to keep good records (although AP reporters spoke with hospital administrators in Gaza who said they record identifying information on every wounded person occupying a bed and every dead body arriving at a morgue, which feeds into a central database). Additionally, active or impending conflict often prevents human rights organizations’ field staff — the people who would typically verify the numbers and identities of the dead in a disaster setting — from being safely able to do their work.There’s another important reason that early figures are worth double-checking: They’re liable to be exaggerated, either upward or downward, by parties whose political aims may be aided by death counts that skew one way or another.“Warring parties themselves have some interest in portraying the conflict in a certain way,” said Pettersson. In most conflicts, parties benefit from minimizing publicly reported deaths of their own fighters, while maximizing publicly reported deaths of their civilians. “I’m not saying that [Hamas] is exaggerating — we don’t know that really, it’s hard to know anything. But there is an interest to do that, to make it sort of fit into the narrative of Israel being the aggressors and Hamas and Gaza’s civilians being the victims,” she said.The Israeli side would have this incentive too. “Each side will have reasons, usually political in nature, to either minimize or overemphasize,” Spiegel said.Historically — in conflicts in 2008, 2014, and 2021 — the health ministry’s fatality numbers closely matched death tolls resulting from independent research by United Nations humanitarian agencies. The current conflict is far more complex than those prior conflicts were, and far fewer nongovernmental agencies are currently able to do that independent verification work in Gaza. However, it is reasonable to expect that when organizations like B’tselem verify deaths in the future, they will find numbers similar to what the ministry is now releasing — if not higher, given how many people remain unaccounted for.Meanwhile, combatant fatalities, if publicized instantaneously, provide information that can be used by an opposing side to determine whether they are correctly targeting battle stations, said Pettersson. The list published by the Gaza Ministry of Health did not distinguish between combatants and civilians, though it has previously stated that nearly two-thirds of those killed are women and children.The interest warring parties have in manipulating real-time fatality data is not unique to this conflict. In the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, something very similar has often played out, said Pettersson. But the dynamic capitalizes on the way we try to understand these kinds of complex events. “That’s also how our brains work,” she said. “Who’s the bad guy and who’s the good one?”Public opinion that gets mobilized by early conflict-related casualty data can have real and significant impact on how the conflict itself plays out, said Lawrence Gostin, who directs the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law. “Public opinion in Berlin, London, Paris, and Washington matters a lot in terms of what political leaders will do,” whether that’s sending aid or other assistance to the region, or voting for certain actions that affect the conflict in the United Nations Security Council. The series of events that followed the al-Ahli Hospital explosion may be one of the best recent examples of how public opinion about fatalities in a conflict can change the course of that conflict. The explosion took place hours before President Biden was set to arrive in the region to meet with Israeli and Arab leaders. But public protests against Israel erupted worldwide; citing anger at Israel’s supposed role in the blast, Arab leaders canceled their planned summit. That meant delaying important conversations about the logistics of delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza and, potentially, about paths toward peace in the region.To capitalize on the dynamic at work in episodes like this one, people with strong allegiances to warring parties may share data about their casualties before it has been confirmed. That’s why it’s so important, when news breaks of a fresh wave of violence in a larger conflict, to be aware that early numbers may be colored by bias — especially when they’re not corroborated by other, independent media sources.Over time, Pettersson says, the exact details of a conflict’s lethality come to light. But when can the general public feel confident that has happened?In the early days of a conflict, the UCDP begins gathering fatality data from open-source materials, including news media, nongovernmental agencies, Telegram, and whatever Twitter is going by. It publishes these on the 20th of each month as “candidate event datasets.” The UCDP isn’t usually able to verify that data until much later — generally a month or more after events have taken place, said Pettersson.  Typically, they’ll work to verify the deaths by going back to the primary source that reported each death, whether that’s a journalist, a warring party, or a witness. Often, this verification takes place in partnership with organizations that are verifying deaths with primary sources on the ground in the conflict area. In Gaza, the UCDP often works with B’tselem — which maintains a database of conflict-related deaths — to complement and triangulate data. But it uses data from other sources, too, including Reuters, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Crisis Group, and a range of smaller organizations.The end result is a list of verified organized violence-related fatalities differentiated by combatants and civilians. Because its definitions are rather strict, the list inevitably underestimates deaths attributable to any given conflict. The UCDP publishes this data annually.(Importantly, UCDP doesn’t count deaths that result indirectly from the conflict, like deaths due to conflict-related famine or sanitation problems. Not because they’re not relevant, said Petterson — it’s just not what her organization does.)There’s some debate over whether feverish media coverage of early fatality estimates is ultimately helpful to people suffering from violent conflict. On one hand, these numbers help us get a sense of the scale of the tragedy unfolding in a war-torn region. We don’t need precise figures to know that when many people are dying, many more are suffering. Early casualty numbers are “at the top of the pyramid,” said Gostin: When a conflict kills a large number of people early on, that signifies a much larger number of people who are extraordinarily vulnerable and need immediate humanitarian aid. Right now, over 1.4 million people are displaced in Gaza, according to the UN.Indeed, these figures may be important for determining how much help an area needs. Some guidelines for providing humanitarian aid use estimates of early mortality in certain age groups to determine the urgency of the response needed, said Spiegel.Still, it’s not always clear that ceaseless, real-time media coverage of evolving conflicts best serves individuals in war zones. “It’s not always good to have this instant sort of information flow,” especially if that information isn’t verified, said Pettersson. “We don’t know how true it is — and then we react on it.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Israeli soldiers routinely detain Palestinian children for throwing rocks,2019-04-27,Vox,['Salwa Sadek'],"Filed under:“Arresting children here is becoming normal,” one human rights activist said.A few weeks ago, a Palestinian teenager was shot and seriously injured by Israeli soldiers as he attempted to flee their custody — despite the fact that he was already handcuffed and blindfolded. Osama Hajahjeh, was among a group of Palestinian youths who were arrested for throwing stones at Israeli soldiers in the West Bank village of Tuqu’. Earlier this month Israeli troops also arrested Zein Idris, a 9-year-old Palestinian boy, at his school in the West Bank city of Hebron and held him at a nearby military base for under an hour. A video clip, recorded by human rights campaigner Aref Jaber, shows Israeli soldiers inside the elementary school attempting to remove Zein Idris and his younger brother, 7-year-old Taim, as teachers and the school principal attempt to stop the soldiers from taking the boys. At one point, a soldier threatens to break a teacher’s arm if he doesn’t let go of Zein. Zein was eventually taken away to an army vehicle and was held at a nearby military base for just under an hour, according to the school.  Osama and Zein are just two of the thousands of Palestinian children who have been detained, injured, or even killed by Israeli armed forces over the years for throwing rocks. “Arresting children here is becoming normal,” Jaber, the human rights activist, told CNN. But children being detained is far from “normal.” “The situation on the ground in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, with more than five decades of Israeli military occupation, is that of a perpetual human rights crisis with severe impact on children’s rights, who are victims of unlawful killings, arbitrary detention, and collective punishment policies such as home demolitions,” Saleh Higazi, deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, told me.Each year approximately 500-700 Palestinian children, some as young as 12, are detained and prosecuted in the Israeli military court system. The most common charge is stone-throwing, according to Defence for Children International-Palestine (DCI-P).Israeli military law allows anyone 12 or older to be imprisoned. But according to Bill Van Esveld, a senior researcher for the Children’s Rights Division at Human Rights Watch, stone throwing is “also considered a ‘security’ crime under Israeli military law, which means that Palestinian kids accused of stones throwing may even be deprived of certain legal protections.” In 2015, Israeli lawmakers pushed forward stricter penalties that directly targeted Palestinian children. Amendments to the Israeli penal code included “a 10-year sentence for throwing a stone, or other object, at traffic, without intent to cause injury, and 20 years for throwing a stone, or other object, at traffic with intent to cause injury.”In the video posted by CNN of Idris’s arrest at school, you can hear one Israeli soldier saying, “The kid threw a stone. It doesn’t matter what age he is.”Israel ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991, which requires that children should only be deprived of their liberty as a measure of last resort, must not be unlawfully or arbitrarily detained, and must not be subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. But, Higazi said, “the situation of the human rights of Palestinian children is only getting worse.”“Impunity for gross violations of children’s rights is the norm in too many places, including in Israel and Palestine,” Van Esveld said. “The Israeli criminal justice system has imposed such severe restrictions on some Palestinian children — arrests, detentions, house raids, house arrests — that they attempted suicide.”Brian K. Barber, a senior fellow at the Institute for Palestine Studies, a nonprofit research institute in Washington, told me rock throwing is “a display of resistance to the occupation.”  “One is fed up and oppressed and humiliated, and wants to respond in some way, and that’s a natural historic form of action,” Barber said.That holds true even when it’s done by a 9-year-old. “That’s what they know has been done by their parents and grandparents, and also it’s the only thing they have really to do to show defiance,” Barber said.However, according to Barber, the Israeli military believes that Palestinians should not challenge them in any way. And while “rock throwing is one way that Palestinians have historically challenged the occupation and Israeli military forces,” those forces have “defined that as something unacceptable and punishable,” he said. Israeli officials also point to numerous incidents in which Israelis have been injured or even killed by thrown rocks or car accidents caused by them to justify the harsh punishments meted out to offenders. Rock-throwing attacks have also been carried out by ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel against the IDF, as well as by Israelis against Palestinians. However, there is a stark contrast in the treatment of those rock-throwers compared to the treatment of Palestinian rock-throwers. While Palestinians are usually physically harmed, verbally or emotionally abused, or even killed, Israelis are typically punished in a humane way. In one example, a 20-year-old Israeli was sentenced to public service, required to pay a fine, and given eight months of probation for throwing rocks and injuring a Palestinian. “There are other laws and practices that create a very big difference in the actual treatment by Israel of 12-year-old kids depending on whether they are Israeli or Palestinian. There is discrimination in the law, and it’s worse in practice,” Van Esveld said. Organizations like War Child, a UK-based nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting and supporting children and young people affected by war, argue that children are being detained when they should instead be receiving psychosocial support for the traumas stemming from living in conflict zones in Gaza and the West Bank. “The need for qualified caregivers vastly outstrips the supply. Meanwhile, the reality children are living continues to create trauma,” Van Esveld said. A study released last month by Norwegian Refugee Council on children living in the Gaza Strip found that more than two-thirds of children surveyed experience psychosocial distress because of the violent response to the Gaza protests and daily attacks they witness — or endure. Alongside this, “a worrying 54% said they had no hope for a brighter future.” The study also found that “a staggering 81% of children struggle academically due to conflict-related stress.” According to DCI-P, 73 percent of children held in detention experienced physical violence following arrest. “These children often give ‘confessions,’ without the presence of a parent or lawyer, after being subjected by Israeli forces to verbal abuse, threats, physical and psychological violence that in some cases amounts to torture, which is absolutely prohibited under international law,” Higazi said.The auditory and sensory violence that children are experiencing day to day, where many are harmed or detained as a form of punishment, rather than receiving psychosocial support, has led to violence becoming a normal part of the reality of their “childhoods.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Joe Sestak’s 2020 presidential campaign and policies, explained",2019-08-13,Vox,['Sean Collins'],"Filed under:Sestak believes his experience, vision, and willingness to defy even his party’s biggest names give him what Americans want in a president. Joe Sestak, the former Congress member and three-star admiral, declared his candidacy for president in late June. He joined a crowded field of candidates that already had established frontrunners who had spent months and millions of dollars building their campaigns and courting voters. And many policy proposals echo those of his more moderate rivals, leaving him in an uphill battle to break out. But he believes his experience as a leader in the Navy, a member of the House of Representatives, a candidate for the US Senate, and a maverick within the Democratic Party gives him the skills and perspective needed to be president of the United States. Sestak joined the race late not because he’d spent most of early 2019 weighing whether to run but because he was caring for his daughter, who began her second fight with brain cancer in 2018. Although she’d improved following an operation late last year, a test that seemed to show the cancer returning made him put a pin in his presidential plans this spring. “I just kept watching to make sure my daughter was in a safe harbor,” Sestak said. Only after doctors declared his daughter in remission did he jump into the race, and on the trail, he often speaks about how the experience has colored his approach to health care reform. His general stance is fairly run-of-the-mill among the Democratic progressives; at minimum, he’s for a robust public option that he hopes most Americans would join, but he would ideally like to implement Medicare-for-all. He also has an idea inspired by his status as a veteran: creating a national health system that would employ physicians, modeled on the Veterans Health Administration. Beyond health care, another place Sestak differs from others in the field is in his focus on foreign policy. The former admiral argues that his time at war alongside NATO allies and the understanding he gained about US adversaries while serving on the National Security Council gives him a clear-eyed vision of the challenges the US faces abroad. And his foreign policy views affect his policies broadly, from his approach to fighting climate change to farming. Even his campaign logo speaks to this focus: At its center is a globe.Sestak has performed poorly in the polls, and he failed to make the stage at the second Democratic primary debate in July. He’ll almost certainly miss the third as well and has yet to make much progress qualifying for the fourth, either. He’s counting on a national health system and a wealth of naval experience to help him stand out amid a crowded field of largely similar and better-known moderates. Whether that’s enough remains to be seen. Joe Sestak spent the majority of his career in the US Navy. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1974 and went on to serve for 31 years in both the Pacific and Atlantic fleets, as well as in Europe and the Persian Gulf. He rose steadily through the ranks, and during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he led the George Washington aircraft carrier battle group — a 30-ship international coalition — into combat. By the time he retired, he had earned a PhD in political economy and government from Harvard University and was a three-star admiral. Sestak has used his naval expertise in strategic roles as well. During the Clinton administration, he served as the director for defense policy on the National Security Council. And during the George W. Bush administration, he became the first head of Deep Blue, a Navy operations group created to fight terrorism following 9/11, before being appointed deputy chief of naval operations for warfare requirements and programs.That final job cemented two personality traits that have come to define Sestak: his (perhaps overzealous) work ethic and his independent (some might say contrarian) spirit. It may have also ended his military career. Then-Chief of Naval Operations Vernon E. Clark tasked Sestak with creating solutions that ran counter to conventional wisdom at the time in an effort to modernize the Navy. He did so — proposing the Navy retire 115 of its 375 ships and arguing for increasing funding for cyberwarfare initiatives. Clark praised Sestak’s ideas, but they  not always well received by others. When Clark retired, Sestak was almost immediately reassigned. The official reason for the change was reportedly that Sestak had created a “poor command climate” — he was known for being a harsh taskmaster — but his unconventional ideas probably didn’t help either.“I put him in that environment where he was in a position to create enemies,” Clark told the New York Times in 2010. “I should have given him better top cover.”Sestak left the service shortly after being reassigned; he said he understood that his new superior officer wanted to bring in his own team, and that he’d planned to retire soon regardless, because at that time his daughter was beginning her first fight with brain cancer.Once his daughter began to recover, however, Sestak planned his next move: joining the House of Representatives. With his brothers and sisters running his campaign, Sestak ran in his native Pennsylvania in 2006, beating a Republican incumbent who’d represented the district for decades with 56 percent of the vote. Sestak ran for a second term in 2008, winning with 59 percent of the vote.During his time in Congress, Sestak was prolific in writing legislation, but few of his bills were ultimately successful. They were, however, focused on many issues central to his presidential campaign: He advocated for a public option to be included in the Affordable Care Act and was a strong critic of the Iraq War at a time when some Democrats feared speaking out against it, worried about appearing weak on national security. On his campaign site, Sestak also touts legislation he worked on to protect senior citizens, expand health care for veterans, and advance small businesses. He was also known for being very accessible to constituents: He kept his office open seven days a week in order to field their concerns. That personal approach became a central element of his next campaign, a controversial race for Senate in 2010 that put him at odds with his party’s most powerful figures. Sestak’s history of irritating leaders in his own party didn’t start with his Senate run, but it certainly came to a (rather public) head then. Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, a Republican, decided to switch parties in 2009; that move gave Democrats a 60-vote majority in the Senate, which was instrumental in getting the Affordable Care Act passed. As thanks for his defection, then-President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell promised to campaign for Specter, not only in the general election but in the primary as well.They made good on this promise; Obama even appeared in television and radio commercials on Specter’s behalf. As Vox’s Dara Lind has explained, Specter had just one problem:Joe Sestak had been considering a Senate run, and he hadn’t made any promises to anybody. Sestak sought the advice of ex-boss Bill Clinton about what to do; Clinton reportedly told Sestak, “Go with your gut.” So Sestak did just that, and jumped into the race.Other national Democrats eventually forced Clinton to get on the phone with Sestak and ask him to drop out, but by that time it was too late.Sestak campaigned with his usual intensity; he again relied on his family for key campaign posts and focused on meeting as many voters as he could, sometimes crossing Pennsylvania four times in 24 hours. During the campaign, he described his method to the New York Times: “We would leave Philadelphia at 10 p.m., get to Pittsburgh at 3 or 4 in the morning, grab sleep for two hours, have our first meeting at 7:30 in the morning, then go all the way back to Philadelphia.” The hard work paid off. Despite every establishment Democrat being against him — and despite briefly embroiling Obama in controversy by saying he’d been offered an administration job in exchange for dropping out — Sestak beat Specter with 54 percent of the vote. In the general election, however, he lost narrowly, falling to his Republican rival by 2 points.  Sestak had come into conflict with the Democratic establishment before; he reportedly butted heads with Rahm Emanuel during his House runs. He won those campaigns, however, and all was forgiven. But during his second try at the Senate in 2016, Sestak was not exactly welcomed back into the fold with open arms, in part because he managed to further incense his party before that race had even begun.First, Sestak endorsed several primary challengers to Democratic incumbents in the 2012 elections. After teaching at Cheyney University, the nation’s oldest historically black college and university, following his Senate loss, he announced plans to run again. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) recommended a campaign chair. Sestak declined, and went on to tell voters he did so because the DSCC had told him to say yes to everything their proposed chair told him to do. The candidate also decided to reuse on his strategy from the 2010 race, except rather than driving back and forth across Pennsylvania, he walked it. National Democrats weren’t pleased. They felt his spurning of their chair and his insistence on covering the state on foot showed Sestak didn’t know what he was doing.Sestak told voters his willingness to defy his party showed that he was an independent-minded politician with their best interests — not his party’s — at heart. The message seemed to resonate; he polled well against the Republican incumbent, far better, in fact, than the candidate the Democratic establishment decided to get behind, Katie McGinty, who had once served as the chief of staff to the governor. Once again, every Democrat from Obama on down endorsed Sestak’s rival, and the DSCC put $1.5 million behind her. This time, Sestak couldn’t beat the establishment and lost to McGinty by about 10 points. McGinty lost to the Republican incumbent, Pat Toomey, by 1 point. Despite this result, Sestak stands by his choice today. And he told Vox his decision remains indicative of the kind of leader he is, emphasizing that he has no problem saying, “‘No, party, you’re wrong.’ And to be able to bear the consequences of that, because as you well know, it is better to offend God than a politician, because at least God gives forgiveness.”As was the case in the 2016 election cycle, Sestak is currently in a tough race and isn’t the favorite of any of his party’s leaders. He has been in this situation before and won, but has also been in this situation before and lost. Unlike in his previous successes, Sestak isn't facing a current or former Republican with a long record, but Democrats who are known nationally, and whose policies are arguably highly in tune with the positions of the electorate. But Sestak believes his personality and proposals give him a strong chance of being the eventual 2020 nominee. Joe Sestak shares the views of many other candidates in the 2020 primary field, and in terms of ideology he falls somewhere between the race’s most progressive candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and more moderate candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden. He supports universal pre-K and wants to make college more affordable (in part by offering what he calls “profit-free loans”) but has not called for universal loan forgiveness like Sens. Warren and Bernie Sanders have. He wants to end fossil fuel subsidies but has not gone so far as to say fossil fuel companies should be forced to pay for efforts to stop climate change, like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has proposed. He supports a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants but has not endorsed the sort of substantial changes to immigration enforcement that former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro calls for.Overall, while Sestak has bucked party leadership on strategy and style, he rarely does so on policy. This was true during his time in Congress (he told Politico during the 2016 campaign, “When I was in the House, I didn’t usually let them know until the last day [how I was going to vote]. But then again, look at my voting record. Oh, my gosh! 100 percent voting record with AFL-CIO!”), and it remains true now. Two places Sestak has differentiated himself from rivals, however, are health care and his ally-centric foreign policy. Sestak credits federal investments in research and the care provided by the Veterans Health Administration with his daughter’s remission from cancer. So much so that he proposes making the US health care system look a lot more like the VHA — should doing so prove to be a wise idea after a four-year trial period.Sestak believes single-payer insurance is a good idea in theory but understands not all Americans agree with him. Therefore, he has a plan to convince the public that it would be better off under a government-sponsored plan, and that maybe it would be better off receiving care from government-employed physicians.He proposes a trial period in which Americans would have three options for receiving care: The effectiveness of each method would be measured regularly for four years with metrics developed ahead of the trial’s launch.  “We can beat Japan and Nazi Germany in four years, but we can’t roll out a government health care website in four years? I really believe, like in the military, the executive branch should execute,” he told Vox.At the end of the four years, Sestak would then choose either the VHA-style structure or the public option and make that the government’s official preferred method of care, eliminating the method that performed worse in the trial. He would not abolish private insurance companies, however; they would remain available to those who wanted them.Americans would then be invited to join either the VHA-style system or the public option by age, similar to the method outlined in Sanders’s Medicare-for-all plan. Older Americans would be asked to sign up first, and over a period of four to six years, the rest of the country would be enrolled, with younger and younger people being added each year.Again, people would not be forced to join the government-run option; Sestak believes most will choose it, however, saying, “I believe you will find, much like once you’re in the VA, once you’re in there, you don’t want out at all.”Sestak developed this plan based on his experiences. While he praises the VHA and the care his daughter Alex received, he said the experience also contained some pitfalls — like a surprise $300,000 bill — that a public option would make impossible. But he also said he understands why someone, particularly a parent, might be reticent to try out something like Medicare-for-all during a critical time in care. “When my daughter’s brain cancer came back last year, if anybody had tried to remove [my insurance] in two or four years, with a mandate suddenly, where my daughter had an 8 percent chance of surviving again  ...  I would have said no,” Sestak says.  While Sestak isn’t the only candidate who has military experience, he is the highest-ranking retired officer among the veterans. And he believes his experience fighting in recent wars and leading international coalitions — as he did during the war in Afghanistan — gives him the experience needed to lead the US and to combat adversaries abroad. He stressed this experience in his campaign announcement video, saying, “I wore the cloth of the nation for over 31 years in peace and war, from the Vietnam and Cold War eras to Afghanistan and Iraq and the emergence of China ... I grew up in this global canvas of service in the United States Navy.” While his military experience does not seem to have made him a Mike Gravel-style pacifist, he has said he would be far more hesitant to use military force than some of his rivals (like then-Sen. Joe Biden) were in the days after 9/11. In an op-ed in the Des Moines Register, Sestak wrote: “I know that militaries can stop a problem, but they can’t fix a problem.”He uses the line in stump speeches, but it also informs his policies, as he explained to a crowd in Iowa when discussing why the military is ill-suited to the task of removing Iran’s nuclear capabilities:Rather than using military force against American adversaries, Sestak calls for coalition-building; he told Vox, “America’s greatest power is its power to convene, to convene the world for a common cause that serves us all.”He has called for bringing together nations to repair the Iran nuclear deal axed by President Trump and working with Israel, Palestine, and the European Union toward a two-state solution. While he supports the Green New Deal, he stresses that the US cannot fight climate change alone and wants to work with other nations, rejoining the Paris climate accords but also expanding its framework to be more aggressive and to include more of a focus on investing in research to reverse damage that has already been done.  He also believes cooperation with allies is needed to combat the country he says is the greatest threat to the US: China. To counter China’s growing power, Sestak proposes working with allies to put pressure on the country through existing international bodies like the World Trade Organization. He also calls for Cold War-style coordination between allied nations to develop economic incentives that could reduce China’s influence in countries it has given loans and aid. “We stopped Germany with our military. We fixed it with the Marshall Plan,” Sestak says. Sestak started his campaign behind his rivals. Joining late meant he didn’t have a chance at the first televised debate, and he has struggled to break through on fundraising and with name recognition. When his name is included in major polls, his support often appears nonexistent. And he did not qualify for the second primary debate in July. But he believes his work ethic will allow him to make up for lost time. While he has said he has no plans to walk across Iowa or South Carolina, he has said he will bring his brand of retail politics to early primary states, focusing on forging personal connections.He’s set up camp in Des Moines, Iowa, having not left the state since he announced his candidacy and, according to the Iowa Starting Line, has built a supportive community around the Econo Lodge where he and his team live. The owner of the hotel has reportedly promised to bring Sestak to his temple; he’s made friends with the construction workers who are repairing the building (they hand out flyers for him). And he’s hired local homeless veterans as campaign workers. Sestak is aware of the challenges he faces; he told Vox he’s seen an internal email from a media company nixing the idea of giving him a town hall. He knows some top Democrats may still hold his Senate races against him. But he believes his story and message can and will resonate with voters.He’s an anti-establishment Democrat who has beaten a Republican in a Republican district, he’s someone with military and foreign policy experience, and he has a deeply personal reason for his approach to health care reform: This is his record and he’s running on it.“What this nation most yearns for and most wants is someone who is accountable to them. Not to party. Not to ideology. Not to self. Not to any special interests,” he told Vox. “That’s what America needs, someone who people actually believe — as they did in my district — is willing to be accountable to them.”Whether voters in the Democratic primary agree remains to be seen.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Biden says he wants a two-state solution. Why is he silent on Israeli settlements?,2022-07-14,Vox,['Jonathan Guyer'],"Filed under:As Biden visits Jerusalem, two states are more elusive than ever. When President Joe Biden discusses Israel, he sounds like he is trapped in the 1990s, when the US had just begun shepherding negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians and two states for two peoples seemed within reach. “Greater peace. Greater stability. Greater connection,” Biden said upon arriving in Israel on Wednesday. “A two-state solution. That remains, in my view, the best way to ensure the future of equal measure of freedom, prosperity, and democracy for Israelis and Palestinians alike.”But the reality in 2022 does not match Biden’s rhetoric or America’s long-held stance. The entrenched occupation of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and the strangulation of those in Gaza, makes the creation of a viable, independent Palestinian state — the stated policy of the Biden administration — all but impossible.The growth of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory has expanded to new levels, with more than 685,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to Israel census data compiled by the nonprofit Peace Now. That path to an independent Palestine seems increasingly untenable, in part because so much of what would be that state in the West Bank and its capital, in East Jerusalem, has been taken over by settlers with tacit and overt support of the Israeli state. The US is Israel’s most powerful international backer and closest partner. “America is the biggest enabler of the settlement project, because America has the biggest stake and the biggest leverage on the Israeli government,” said Michael Sfard, an Israeli lawyer who represents human rights groups and is an expert on illegal settlements. “For years, Israel was allowed to build settlements, to expand settlements, to confiscate Palestinian lands, to retroactively legalize — or kosher — major trespasses into private or privately owned Palestinian lands. And America has done nearly nothing to stop it.”Severe setbacks for the two-state solution have made US policy seem far-fetched at this point. That reality came across in Biden’s remarks. “We’ll discuss my continued support — even though I know it’s not in the near term — a two-state solution,” he said upon his arrival this week. He conceded that such an outcome was elusive, while still clinging to it. A number of factors have contributed to the declining prospects for an independent Palestinian state. Not enough US diplomatic muscle has been put into making the deal happen. The recently disbanded Israeli government didn’t even agree to it as policy (and the previous prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t really, either). Divisions between the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank and Gaza have detracted from the Palestine Liberation Organization’s authority and legitimacy as a negotiating partner. And wealthy Arab states, like the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, have prioritized normalizing relationships with Israel — which come with economic and tech cooperation, defense business, and weapons sales — at the expense of Palestinian rights.But the largest by far is the rampant expansion of settlements in the West Bank that has precluded Palestinians from living there.  After the 1967 war, Israel came into possession of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, and Golan Heights. This was, under international law, occupied territory. There were some people within Israel who saw this as an opportunity to negotiate with Arab states and the Palestinians, and trade this land for peace (which is what ultimately happened with the return of the Sinai and Israel’s 1979 peace agreement with Egypt).But there was a portion of Israelis and the American Jewish community who saw this occupied territory as a chance to widen Israel’s borders beyond the green line, or the 1949 armistice border that had long demarcated the state of Israel, and enlarge the country to what they saw as its biblical or historic land. Part of this project was religiously and ideologically motivated (Hebron in the occupied West Bank, for example, figures largely in biblical lore); and part of it related to security. By occupying and developing key pieces of land on the Jordan River and in the Jordan Valley, especially those at a high elevation or along transportation corridors, Israel could better protect itself. “What started out as a bunch of pins thrown up on a map became a deep network crisscrossing the West Bank of Israeli Jewish settlements, established in strategic locations,” Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, told me. Those new informal communities grew into developments and cities, “erasing the Green Line, so you can no longer see what is Israel,” according to Friedman. She says that settlers deliberately sought to “prevent the connection and expansion of Palestinian localities in the West Bank.”In the early 2000s, amid the Second Intifada or Palestinian uprising, and in response to several terrorist attacks, Israel began building a separation barrier — what Palestinians call the apartheid wall. The 30-foot-tall concrete wall snakes throughout the occupied West Bank, not following the contours of the Green Line but gobbling up Palestinian land. The result is a broken archipelago of Palestinian cities and communities, separated by walls and settlements that make Palestinian life disconnected bantustans. (Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon oversaw the withdrawal of Israeli settlers from Gaza in 2005, but Israel maintains total authority over Gaza’s airspace and land and sea borders, controlling what goes in and out of the territory.)That separate legal systems are enforced for Israeli settlements and Palestinians in West Bank has led human rights organizations, including the Israeli group B’Tselem, to label the occupied West Bank as an “apartheid regime.”The recent Israeli government of Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, according to Peace Now, has presided over a massive rise in settlement construction permits and escalating Palestinian home demolitions. Israeli settler violence against Palestinians has also increased from the Netanyahu years. “What we’re sometimes missing is that the settlements are not only destroying the possibility to undo them, but they are harming right now the lives of the Palestinians,” Hagit Ofran of Peace Now’s Settlement Watch project told me. She emphasizes how settlers dispossess Palestinians of their own land and properties. “Even now, we see it very blatantly with violence and kicking them out physically from their fields,” she said. “And the settlers have now a very strong political power in Israel.”US policies have at times enabled Israel as it pursued settlement growth in spite of an established State Department opinion that considered them illegal. But in 2019, President Donald Trump ruptured four decades of US policy by recognizing settlements in the West Bank as not violating international law. That was in contrast to the Obama administration, which had made a partial freeze of settlements a cornerstone of a policy that it had hoped would lead to the relaunch of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over the two-state solution. (Those talks ultimately failed in the face of Netanyahu’s recalcitrant leadership and as domestic politics in the US made it difficult for President Barack Obama to take a tough line.)When Biden visited Israel in March 2010 as vice president, Israel announced 1,600 new settlement units in East Jerusalem, which under international law is considered occupied territory. “I condemn the decision by the government of Israel,” Biden said at the time.It was hugely embarrassing. “The political animals around Biden have learned all the wrong lessons from the Obama era,” Friedman told me. “The main lesson they learned was, ‘We don’t want to fight with Israel over settlements, or anything really.’”This time around, Biden’s team went out of its way to avoid a replay of the 2010 debacle and ensure no new settlement building would be announced while Biden is in the Middle East. The State Department’s top Middle East official, Barbara Leaf, went to Israel last month and asked the Israeli government to forestall any new settlement announcements, Israeli military moves, or demolitions of Palestinian homes. The result: The construction of new settlements and outposts has been postponed until after Biden leaves the region. Yet entrenched Trump administration policies still shape Biden’s efforts in the Middle East.As president, Trump reversed decades of US policy toward Israel: He declared that settlements didn’t violate international law, shuttered the US consulate in Jerusalem that in effect served as an embassy for Palestinians, and moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which is occupied territory according to international law. The Trump administration also threw aside Israel-Palestine talks entirely in favor of a policy of ignoring Palestinian rights and normalizing Israel’s relations with Arab states like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco. “I don’t want to brag that we’ve won,” Yigal Dilmoni, the CEO of the settlement council, said in 2018. “Others would say it appears that we’re winning.”Now, Biden is de facto continuing many of these policies. Though his administration has returned to funding the United Nations aid agency for Palestinian refugees and made efforts to restore diplomatic ties with Palestine, the administration hasn’t officially undone Trump’s policy toward Israeli settlements — something that Politico correspondent Nahal Toosi has persistently been asking the administration about, though Biden’s team tends to ignore the line of questioning.For Friedman, a former State Department official who has been monitoring Israeli settlements since she worked at the US consulate in Jerusalem from 1992 to 1994, the Biden administration is simply not doing enough. “Since Biden came into office, we have seen a surge in settlement activity in the West Bank, we have seen a surge in settler violence, we’ve seen a surge in targeting in East Jerusalem,” she told me. “And there’s nothing — all you’ll get is the most empty rhetoric. It’s as empty as we had under Trump.”The US could take specific moves to curb settlement growth, says Yousef Munayyer of the Arab Center Washington. “The idea that land cannot be taken by force is a fundamental norm in the post–World War Two era,” he said. “What I would like Biden to do on settlements is exactly what he would do on settlements if there were Russian settlements being built in Ukraine. And I think he knows exactly what he would do.” There would be economic sanctions and intensive diplomacy with ultimatums, not silence.The most obvious, considering the extent of human rights violations, would be the US withholding the multibillion-dollar annual military aid package to Israel or portions of loan guarantees (as the George H.W. Bush administration did). Other options would be making critical public statements or pursuing hard-nosed private diplomacy (like no White House visits or Pentagon meetups until Israel changes its policies). “We know the White House has the tools, but they don’t have the will to use the tools,” Munayyer told me.Though the Biden administration may say the right things, it appears that they’ve made a political judgment not to quibble over settlements. So you get comments like this from State Department spokesperson Jalina Porter — “Israel’s program of expanding settlements deeply damages the prospect for a two-state solution” — but no American leverage or influence to back up the criticism. The US has long used its UN Security Council veto to insulate Israel from criticism. But when member states brought forward a resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity at the end of Obama’s term in December 2016, the US let the resolution pass. Then-Secretary of State John Kerry defended the move, saying that settlements are detrimental to Israeli security and undermine the possibility of two states. As Kerry put it then, “it is the permanent policy of settlement construction that risks making peace impossible.”In the years since, there have been 71,390 more Israeli settlers, bringing them to over 685,000 — and the number continues to grow.

Israel’s crackdown on dissent will only hurt it,2023-11-01,Vox,['Sigal Samuel'],"Filed under:Silencing criticism makes it harder for Israel’s leaders to think clearly.
    Finding the best ways to do good. 
  Eight years ago, I published a novel about a Montreal Jewish family with a dangerous mystical obsession. It had absolutely nothing to do with Israel. But that didn’t stop a former Israeli combat soldier from trying to get me disinvited from a book event. He emailed the venue, arguing that it should not promote an author who had written critically about the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, as I had during my time as an Israel-Palestine reporter. “This,” he wrote, “is a disgrace.”Luckily, the venue held firm and I got to do the event. But that experience — absolutely trivial compared to the censorship Palestinians have long experienced — planted a worry in my mind: If I, a Jew and citizen of Israel, am not allowed to question the Israeli government’s narrative, then who is?The answer, increasingly, is nobody.Not the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen, who was supposed to speak at Manhattan cultural hub 92NY but saw his event abruptly pulled after he signed an open letter condemning Israel’s war in Gaza.Not the editor-in-chief of science journal eLife, Michael Eisen, who was fired after reposting an Onion article about Gaza with the headline “Dying Gazans Criticized for Not Using Last Words to Condemn Hamas.” Not the Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave, who tweeted that “war crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies,” referring to Israel’s war in Gaza, and then had to resign from leading Europe’s biggest tech conference.Not the Boston Workers Circle, a Jewish cultural center that got ousted from the Boston Jewish community’s umbrella group after cosponsoring a rally calling for a ceasefire.Not the Israeli professors, journalists, and lawmakers who have been suspended, fired, or even arrested for criticizing the war in Gaza.And not even the Israeli hostages who were recently released from Hamas captivity. When 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz stated that she was “given access to medical care” and “treated well while in captivity,” Israeli officials moved to prevent any similar press conferences in the future.American commentators, viewing all this through the lens of American politics, call the silencing of Israel’s critics “cancel culture.” But it’s more serious than that. This is political repression. And that’s a problem not only because it cuts against the value of free speech, but because it stands to hurt everyone, including Israel itself. Silencing voices that challenge the status quo and branding all dissent as disgrace makes it harder for those in power to think clearly. And clear thinking is crucial — especially in wartime.   For intellectuals and artists who are now criticizing Israeli policies for the first time, the intensity of the backlash they face may come as a shock. But it shouldn’t, because for decades, Israel has been silencing Palestinians who protest the occupation and advocate for their own freedom. Is it really so surprising that after silencing Palestinian dissenters, Israel would end up silencing others who dissent, whether they’re American, European, or even Israeli?  The curbs on Palestinian freedom of expression go back at least as far as 1967, when Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza and set up a military occupation that still deprives Palestinians of some basic civil rights. “Since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, it has ruled using military orders issued in those early days,” explains Human Rights Watch. “Under those orders, the Israeli army has stripped Palestinians of basic civil rights protections, arresting Palestinian journalists, activists, and others for their anti-occupation speech, activism, and political affiliations.” Recent examples abound.

  Israeli and American Jews started to pay more attention over the past decade, when the repression began to target them. Starting around 2012, it became more common to see Jews critical of Israeli policies disinvited from speaking gigs. In 2013, college students who were sick of the leading Jewish campus group Hillel International telling them who could and couldn’t speak about Israel formed Open Hillel to promote more pluralistic debate. And 2014 saw the launch of Canary Mission, an anonymously run website that blacklists people sympathetic to Palestinians and posts dossiers on their personal lives and activism. Over the ensuing years, as Israel launched repeated military operations in Gaza so common that they became known as “mowing the grass,” American sympathies, long solidly pro-Israel, began to shift toward Palestinians, especially on the left. This March, a Gallup poll found for the first time that Democrats sympathize more with Palestinians than Israelis. Israel’s government, which has lurched to the far right under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, responded to these shifts not by tempering its policies but by increasingly stifling its critics. One strategy has been to brand absolutely any criticism of Israel antisemitic. Many Jews disagree with that characterization, noting that although anti-Jewish hate is all too real — we’re seeing it surging today — it doesn’t help Jews or anyone else to use it as a shield for everything Israel does to Palestinians.Many journalists and analysts warned during this period that the space for dissent about Israeli policies was shrinking. Now, it’s shrunk so much that, as the writer Sarah Schulman recently noted in New York magazine, the result is a state of “‘manufactured consent’ — Noam Chomsky’s term for a system-supported propaganda by which authorities and media agree on a simplified reality, and it becomes the assumptive truth.” The latest crackdown on dissent in the Israel-Hamas war is so stark that some journalists and civil rights groups are labeling it downright “McCarthyite.” The reference to the Cold War era in America is apt. During the “Red Scare,” the atmosphere was so hyper-suspicious that fear overtook reason. Case in point: thousands of Americans accused of sympathizing with communism were booted from their jobs even though no evidence of disloyalty was found. Some scholars have analogized the climate of repression in Israel after the October 7 Hamas attack to the climate in America after 9/11. In both countries, shocking attacks that killed many civilians occasioned fear, rage, and a thirst for revenge. As the Middle East scholar and pollster Shibley Telhami recalled on X this month, “Shrinking media space for criticizing US policy in Israel/Gaza is reminiscent of the pre-2003 Iraq war period. In the middle of war frenzy, it became harder to publish anti-war analysis.” We all saw how that turned out. US politicians alleged, based on faulty reports from the intelligence community, that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. As media outlets overflowed with pundits beating the drums of war, the last Gallup poll before the US invasion of Iraq showed 64 percent of Americans in favor of invading. That support actually rose to 72 percent after the US operation began, despite the failure to turn up any evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.At times like these, it’s incredibly useful to have dissenting voices who force us to consider what the evidence is telling us. Yet in both these cases, we see not only that people have a tendency to close ranks when they feel threatened, but also that they tend to undervalue counter-evidence. They also don’t think clearly about how they’ll make a region safer after war winds down. America would have benefited from listening to dissenters after 9/11; instead, it silenced them. Israel — with support from its strongest ally, the US — is now making the same mistake.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"Occupation, annexation and other terms you should know related to the Israel-Hamas war",2023-10-24,Vox,['Nicole Narea'],"Filed under:The words that explain, define, and obfuscate the conflict.During a war, political actors, human rights groups, and the media can use unfamiliar terminology without adequately explaining it — or even using it correctly. That’s especially true of the Israel-Hamas war and the broader historical context behind it.To that end, Vox is writing a glossary to define and contextualize some of these terms, when possible relying on the accepted laws of conflict and international humanitarian law, or IHL.We’ll include terms that apply specifically to the history of Israel and Palestine, as well as some that apply to conflict generally.Broadly speaking, laws around conduct during armed conflict are found in the Geneva Conventions, the post-World War II agreements that form the basis of IHL. Customary IHL — principles either reflected in international manuals on the laws of war or in precedents from previous legal cases — fills in some of the gaps left by the Geneva Conventions or other treaties.IHL in the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict is often difficult to understand mostly because the situation exceeds the concepts and language set out in the law, Laurel Fletcher, co-director of the International Human Rights Law Clinic at the University of California Berkeley, told Vox. That’s true for many reasons; one of which is that the conflict is between a nation-state (Israel) and Hamas, which is technically a non-state actor though it governs Gaza.“What’s harder in this conflict is that Hamas does not follow the laws of war,” Fletcher said, reportedly using human shields and concealing their operations in civilian infrastructure in Gaza — blurring the lines between a legitimate military target and areas that must be protected under IHL — as well as deliberately killing and kidnapping Israeli civilians. Another complicating factor is the status of Gaza itself — whether it’s occupied under the terms of international law or whether that occupation is not official but de facto. That “informs Israel’s legal interpretation of what obligations it is under” to Palestinians in Gaza under IHL, Fletcher explained. “International laws did not contemplate this situation,” Fletcher told Vox, and in some senses, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict explodes some of the concepts of IHL; there is not always a clear-cut aggressor in a given round of violence, and the way IHL understands occupation — as a temporary status in which the occupied territory retains its own laws, for example — doesn’t apply to the Israeli-Palestinian context. But IHL still governs armed conflict and all parties are obligated to adhere to it, even if they often don’t.With that in mind, we’ll point out when the situation on the ground complicates IHL concepts, in recognition of the fact that this is a messy, emotional, evolving conflict — and add to this glossary as the war unfolds. Under international law, a territory is considered occupied “when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army” such that the army has “effective control.” There are three elements to consider when determining whether the term fits: whether the foreign army is present without the consent of the local government when it invaded, whether the local government can exercise its powers, and whether the occupying forces exert their own powers over the territory instead. By that definition, many experts in international law say that Israel has occupied the Gaza Strip, as well as the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Syrian Golan Heights, since 1967. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967, and under the 1947 UN partition plan for the region, the other territories were reserved for a future Palestinian state, while all of Jerusalem was to be governed by an international body.   The nature of Israel’s occupation has varied across these territories and across time, but in all these areas, Israel controls basic utilities, such as water and electricity. The West Bank, for instance, is under military occupation and has been settled by Israelis, who have become increasingly violent toward Palestinians in the last year.The Golan Heights are also under Israeli military occupation, and there are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan, home to about 20,000 people. For decades, Syria has refused to sign any peace treaty with Israel unless it cedes control of the Golan Heights. Though Israel has claimed to have annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, it has not done so by the standards of international law, which requires that both the occupying and occupied powers consent to annexation. Then, there’s Gaza: Though Israel withdrew its settlements from Gaza in 2005, it has still exercised effective control of Gaza. While there is not international consensus that this amounts to an occupation, many experts consider it sufficient to meet the international law definition. Even before this war broke out, Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza that restricted access to basic goods and restricted the movement of people in and out of the territory. It controlled all heavily militarized access points to Gaza with the exception of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which coordinates with Israel to manage it. Occupying powers are charged with certain obligations to the civilian population. That includes taking measures to ensure public order, safety, and sufficient hygiene and health standards, and to provide food and medical care. Occupying powers are also prohibited from forcibly transferring the population from or within the occupied territory and exerting collective punishment on the local population. Finally, occupying powers must allow access to international humanitarian aid.Israel has deliberately ignored those obligations, especially amid the war in Gaza.“According to international legal authorities, Israel remains [an] occupying power, which means that it has all of the obligations toward civilians that an occupying power would have, which of course does not fulfill,” said Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University.Open-air prison isn’t terminology under international humanitarian law (IHL) like some of the other words and phrases on this list; rather, it’s used specifically in this context to describe the living conditions in Gaza — particularly, the control and surveillance Palestinians in Gaza live under, but also the general difficulty of accessing basic necessities.Different groups, from pro-Palestinian activists to reporters to human rights groups, have applied the concept to Gaza “at least since the late 1990s,” Ilana Feldman, a professor of anthropology, history, and international affairs at George Washington University, wrote in 2015. At the term’s point of origin, Gaza was still under military occupation by Israeli forces— an occupation that lasted 38 years and ended with the complete withdrawal of those troops in 2005.In that context, the term refers to the lack of independence, the inability to come and go freely; the heavy surveillance of the security state; and the fact that these conditions are being imposed upon Gaza by an outside actor, Israel.Today, many of these factors remain, albeit under a slightly different framework. Since Hamas took power in 2007, Israel (with the help of Egypt) has imposed a blockade on the territory that some human rights groups say amounts to an ongoing occupation that carries legal responsibilities. Gaza does not control its land, sea, or air borders. In all but rare cases, Gaza residents cannot leave the 141-square-mile territory through the border crossing with Israel for travel, study, or work opportunities (there are some limited exceptions, like for work permits within Israel). These policies, which Israel justifies on security grounds, don’t just preclude international travel through Israel but also effectively sever Palestinians in Gaza from the West Bank (a territory of Palestinians separated from Gaza by Israeli territory). Egypt, meanwhile, restricts movement through Rafah, its one border crossing, and has at times closed it completely due to concerns that extremists and weapons might make their way to Sinai, where they could launch attacks against Israel and draw Egypt into conflict with Israel. Palestinians in occupied territories are subject to an intense surveillance state. Israel uses facial recognition technology to monitor Palestinians in cities like Hebron, as well as significant CCTV surveillance in public spaces in the Palestinian territories. Poor living conditions caused largely by the blockade on goods have also eroded the quality of life in Gaza, as have repeated, escalating cycles of violence between Hamas and Israel. Poverty rates are 53 percent in Gaza, compared to 14 percent in the other occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank, according to the International Monetary Fund. Now, under the combined effects of the 16-year blockade and the current conflict, conditions in Gaza are more horrific than ever. The present conditions essentially make Gaza less of an open-air prison and push it more, as Helen Ottens-Patterson, Doctors Without Borders’ former Gaza head of mission, told Vox, toward “the abyss.”Collective punishment refers to a government or occupying force harming a person or group of people based on the actions of another member of their group in the context of an armed conflict. It is a war crime, and it is prohibited under the third and fourth Geneva Conventions, which were ratified after World War II, as well as additional protocols established in 1977.In its strictest definition, collective punishment applies to “sanctions and harassment of any sort, administrative, by police action or otherwise,” according to customary international law. This is meant to apply specifically to legal and criminal punishments in the context of armed conflict — things like confiscating passports or other documentation, arresting individuals, or imposing other legal penalties on a person not for something they themselves did, but because of the actions of another member of their group or perceived group.The Syrian civil war provided some examples of this narrow sense; in 2019, for example, the regime of Bashar al-Assad seized assets of the families of people the regime had deemed “terrorists.”Colloquially, the term is often applied to a variety of other actions. “The term is used more broadly to include strikes on civilians in response to something that someone else did — their state or some members of their community — as a form of retaliation or revenge,” Adil Haque, a professor at Rutgers University who studies the international law of armed conflict and the philosophy of international law, told Vox in an interview.A UN panel of independent experts said in an October 12 statement that Israel’s airstrikes on Gaza in response to Hamas’s murder and kidnapping of Israeli civilians on October 7 is collective punishment.But the siege in Gaza is actually violating the laws of occupation rather than collective punishment in the strictest sense, Haque explained, if one considers Gaza to be occupied territory. And if one accepts that Gaza is occupied, the siege can credibly be called a war crime. Though there is debate about whether Gaza is technically occupied — there are no troops on the ground, but Israel controls Gaza’s air, sea, and land borders and many other aspects of life in the territory — occupying powers are obligated under IHL to provide the necessities of life for people in the occupied territory including food, water, medical care, fuel and electricity, and education. Indiscriminate attacks and bombings are also considered to be collective punishment in the colloquial sense of the term, but from an international law perspective, they relate more to the concepts of proportionality and the obligations of all parties to a conflict to protect civilians. For more on those concepts, the International Committee of the Red Cross is a helpful resource.Forced displacement, sometimes also referred to as forced migration, is permissible under IHL only if it’s occurring to protect civilians in the course of a necessary military operation as part of an international or national conflict. Because it can be considered legal in certain circumstances, then, it’s difficult to prosecute as an individual crime. That prosecution becomes even more complicated when the forced displacement is carried out by a party that could be considered an occupying power. Therefore, it’s often prosecuted as part of other crimes, like ethnic cleansing and genocide, but only if the displacement is motivated by the ethnicity of the group in question.Under IHL, whoever orders the displacement must ensure that the civilians will eventually be able to return to their homes, that they will be evacuated to a relatively safe location, and that they will be provided with necessities like food, water, shelter, and medical care when they arrive.The evacuation of British cities during World War II could be considered an instance of legal forced displacement: At the behest of the British government, 1.5 million people left their homes for their safety during the course of an international conflict. They were provided basic necessities when they got to their destinations, and it was understood that they would be able to return to their homes when it was safe to do so.  On October 13, the Israel Defense Forces told the approximately 1.1 million Gaza residents in the north of the territory to leave their homes and head south to avoid being hurt or killed in a military operation. They are not to return to the area until given an order from the authorities.But Israel didn’t follow IHL in ordering this displacement; the state provided none of the basic necessities it is required to under IHL and in fact has prevented civilians from obtaining those necessities under the ongoing siege. Only after days of negotiations and intense international pressure did authorities in Israel and Egypt allow 20 trucks of humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing at Gaza’s southern border. Israel will defend its operations in northern Gaza as necessary in the course of the war; it’s unclear that international bodies like the International Criminal Court or the United Nations would agree.Another critical aspect of forced displacement under IHL is that it’s temporary: The civilians who have been moved for their safety must be allowed to return to their homes after the operation or other incident is over. But it’s not clear that this will happen in the context of the Israel-Hamas war.This concern, deepened by Palestinians’ continued displacement since 1948, is part of the reason Egypt has been unwilling to take in Palestinian refugees from Gaza. “What is happening now in Gaza is an attempt to force civilian residents to take refuge and migrate to Egypt, which should not be accepted,” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said in a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last week. Annexation is “a unilateral act of a State [proclaiming] its sovereignty over the territory of another State” by force or threat of force, per IHL. It is “forbidden by international law.”Prohibitions against annexation have been part of international law since World War I, though the concept took on more significance in light of Germany’s actions in World War II. Unlike occupation, annexation is never considered legal under international law.“From an international law perspective, annexation does not happen,” Haque said. That means that while a country might claim territories in conflict or by use of force, and might formally draw their maps to include those territories and impose their laws on the people within them, international law does not recognize those claims. One clear example of annexation is Russia’s claim that parts of Ukraine — Crimea and the Donbas — are actually Russian. This annexation began as a military operation in 2014, when Russia sent “little green men” into Crimea, and culminated in its ongoing invasion of Ukrainian territory.Moscow made formal announcements when it annexed Crimea and the Donbas; Russian laws now govern those territories, even though international law does not recognize those claims. Regarding the current conflict, there are several contexts in which annexation is discussed. First: Israel understands the Golan Heights to be part of its territory and formally annexed it in 1981; however, international law considers it to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 war.The extent to which Israel views this territory as its own can be seen in the way some politicians speak about it: “I actually consider the last 50 years as the slow process of Israel defining its borders,” Einat Wilf, a former Labour member of the Knesset, said on the podcast The Hated and the Dead a few days before Hamas’s October 7 attack. “With the peace agreement with Egypt and the peace agreement with Jordan and the getting out of Lebanon and the annexation of the Golan Heights, Israel enters a process of determining its final borders.” Then there’s the matter of East Jerusalem and the West Bank — territories that do not belong to Israel, according to a 1947 United Nations partition plan for the region. Over time, Israel has encroached on East Jerusalem, building settlements and evicting Palestinian families from their homes. Tensions over access to the al-Aqsa mosque, or Temple Mount — a holy site to both Muslims and Jews — have flared in recent years.And finally, there’s the West Bank, an area that was reserved under the UN plan for a future Palestinian state. Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which has a majority Palestinian population but is occupied by Israel, are, for some settlers, part of a project to ultimately annex the region. “Over time, messianic Religious Zionist ideology developed as a significant driver of the settlement movement, based on the notion of a religious imperative for Jews to settle the entire Land of Israel,” according to a brief by the Israel Policy Forum, an American Jewish organization working for a two-state solution. “Settlements established as part of this religious movement were often placed in regions with a large Palestinian population in order to secure Jewish dominance over the territory, prevent a Palestinian state, and secure the entire West Bank for Israel.” The US later recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights under Trump and reaffirmed it under Biden. The US under Trump also moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2017 — a move made in recognition of the fact that Israel had made unified Jerusalem its capital, but a decidedly controversial one in the international arena, given the international legal issues. Trump’s administration also argued in 2019 that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are not necessarily illegal, lending legitimacy to Israel’s claims on the territories. But the annexations and moves toward it are widely regarded as illegal under international law, and no other country has recognized them. Normalization refers to efforts to establish diplomatic relations between Israel and neighboring Arab countries with the aim of achieving stability, if not peace, in the Middle East.Beginning in 1945, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, and what is now known as Jordan formed an “Arab League” that opposed the state of Israel because of the Palestinian Arab population that was displaced as a result of its inception in 1948. It sought to advance the Palestinian cause, often by use of force. Some member countries repeatedly and violently clashed with Israel — including in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the 1967 Six-Day War, and the 1973 Yom Kippur War — and helped create the Palestine Liberation Organization, a coalition of Palestinian nationalists, initially as a form of militant opposition to Israel. It’s been decades since those Arab League countries directly fought Israel, and two of them have signed peace treaties with Israel — Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. That’s even though the plight of Palestinians remains unresolved, with US-led talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, frozen since 2014.The US has consequently sought to establish diplomatic, economic, and security channels between Israel and its Arab neighbors with the objective of achieving a level of regional stability that would allow it to turn its attention to other parts of the world, including Russia and China. The Trump administration facilitated the Abraham Accords to normalize relations between Israel and several of its Muslim-majority neighbors — the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan — members of the now-expanded Arab League, but not ones that have ever been at war with Israel. The Biden administration also sought to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, in part so that they could form a united front against Iran, a common adversary that financially supports Hamas.Public support in Arab countries for normalization has been low. But for the leaders of the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco, signing a normalization agreement with Israel made sense since relations between those countries already “were in some respects quite close, if not public before those Abraham accords were signed,” said Beinin, the professor of Middle East history at Stanford University. It also has facilitated arms sales between the signatory countries.Since the outbreak of war in Gaza, the Saudis have been talking to Iran, seemingly dooming the prospect of a normalization deal for now. Zionism is a movement that supports the establishment of a permanent homeland for Jewish people in the region now known as Israel and Palestine.Its roots as a political movement date back to the late 19th century following the outbreak of pogroms targeting Jews in what was then Russia, present-day Ukraine, and Poland, where Jews were unfairly blamed for the assassination of Czar Alexander II. The violence and the broader rise in antisemitism in Europe in that period drove many Jews toward political activism, including nationalist movements such as Zionism.Not all Jews were Zionists (and not all Jews are Zionists now, either). In fact, it was initially a minority movement led by Austrians and Germans. Austrian journalist Theodor Herzl is regarded as the father of modern Zionism, formalizing the ideology in his 1896 German-language pamphlet “The Jewish State.” In it, he argued that the only way Jews could be freed from persecution and discrimination amid rising antisemitism in Europe was to establish, with the support of the international community, their own secular nation. He argued that Palestine was the ideal location because of its historical and religious significance to Jews, the Land of Israel promised to them by God in the Bible and from which they were forced into centuries of exile.Herzl unsuccessfully sought support for the program from the Ottoman Empire, which then controlled Palestine. But he found an ally in Britain, which offered Zionists 6,000 square miles of uninhabited land in Uganda or locations in other countries. But the Zionists wanted Palestine, and tens of thousands of Jews from Europe began to emigrate there anyway. The British would later come around, however, in their 1917 Balfour Declaration, which unilaterally called for the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine, despite the fact that Jewish people made up less than 15 percent of the population there at the time. Though the declaration vowed that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” it did not outline what those communities were, what specific rights they had, or how they would be protected, and it didn’t take into account their thoughts about how their land should be used.After World War I, the Allied powers backed the declaration, and the newly created League of Nations gave Britain a mandate to temporarily rule Palestine until the Jewish state could be created. Jewish immigration to the area increased, particularly in the early to mid-1930s and after the horrors of the Holocaust, and the influx sparked violent clashes at various times. After World War II, the United Nations agreed to partition Palestine into two states, one for the area’s Jewish population and another for the Arab population, with the city of Jerusalem to be governed by a special international entity. However, local Arabs and Arab countries objected to the plan.Following a period of extreme violence before, during, and after the war — particularly on the part of Zionist militias — British forces withdrew from Palestine, and Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948. It won the war with neighboring Arab states that followed, capturing 77 percent of the previous Palestinian mandate territory, including land that the UN had intended to allocate to the Palestinian Arab population. Israel later ended up giving some of that land back to neighboring Arab countries as part of agreements brokered to end various bouts of armed conflict that broke out over the decades. But in 1980, it also annexed East Jerusalem — home to holy sites of significance to Jews, Muslims, and Christians — in a move violating international law, as well as occupied and encroached on Palestinian territory in the West Bank and in Gaza. In 2005, the Israeli government under right-wing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon withdrew entirely from Gaza and dismantled four Israeli settlements in the West Bank in a bid to improve Israeli security. Today, with the Jewish state of Israel firmly established, Zionism remains a diverse movement that encompasses people with a broad range of beliefs, including on the policies of the Israeli government. Many Jews feel a kinship to Israel, even if they do not explicitly identify as Zionist. Leftist Zionists believe in Israel’s right to exist peacefully but may also support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Palestinian self-determination. Right-wing Zionists, on the other hand, have promoted expansionist policies and Israeli settlements in occupied territory. In recent years, it’s those right-wing Zionists who have had control of the Israeli government.

What do leftist critics of Israel do now?,2023-10-20,Vox,['Christian Paz'],"Filed under:How the mainstream left is trying to save its approach to Israel from the pro-Hamas fringe.They marched on the White House to make their demands clear: a Biden-brokered ceasefire — now; the release of hostages held by Hamas militants; more forceful American condemnation of Israel’s bombing of Gaza; and, eventually, major changes to the current Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians.The protestors, gathered Monday afternoon by progressive Jewish American activist organizations, represented various segments of the US political left: Palestinian and Israeli Americans, Jewish and Muslim people, longtime activists, and newer allies sympathetic to a more nuanced position of peace and reform for Israel and Palestine.But they also represent a more mainstream progressive vision of Palestinian liberation and anti-Zionism than the one elevated in the days after the Hamas attack last week. Early news coverage, social media algorithms, and politicians and commentators from both major parties zeroed in on protests celebrating Hamas, social media posts by far-left groups, and open letters and rallies organized on college campuses as the true face of the American left. But many of these activists and organizers have spent the last week rebutting that image, refocusing the political and media narrative about the consequences of the Israel-Hamas war and American complicity, and building up support for American diplomacy from the grassroots and in Washington.This wasn’t the first major demonstration in the capital — a weekend protest organized by the pro-Palestinian advocacy group American Muslims for Palestine also drew thousands — but these anti-war protestors marched to the White House as their calls picked up institutional recognition and support in the halls of Congress. On Monday, 13 progressive members of Congress — not just the Squad — signed on to a resolution calling on the Biden administration to broker an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Palestine and urge de-escalation in order to bring humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.“That resolution represents what most of us actually want to see,” Beth Miller, the political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, one of the groups that organized the Monday protest, told Vox. “The most important thing for our members of Congress to understand and for the general American public to understand is that there is no military solution to what is happening right now. Israel is dropping bombs on entire families and neighborhoods of people, and it will not solve anything. It will only lead to more violence in the long run.” The protest, which continued into the evening as demonstrators blocked roads and entrances to the White House and adjoining government buildings, came on a day when activists said they felt winds changing. Yes, there was early splintering in the left’s response and domination by fringe and radical elements during the days following Hamas’s mass infiltration of southern Israel. But progressive groups are better organized now, feel more emboldened to make demands of American leaders, and feel like they’re gaining support in Congress. They say the images from Gaza, the rhetoric of politicians in Israel and the US, the devastation caused by the Israeli military, and the “blank check” issued by American leaders to Israel are all fueling their movement and reinforcing the message they want the public to hear. On Wednesday, these same organizers would take protestors directly to Congress, marching to the Capitol, sitting-in at a congressional office building, and, like at the White House, some would get arrested. The hearts, minds, and policies they’re trying to change won’t be easily altered. Though most Americans were sympathetic to both Palestinians and Israelis and open to more nuanced solutions to the Israel-Palestine conflict, public polling from last week following Hamas’s attack shows Americans, including more Democrats and independents, warming to the Israeli military’s response. This shift is likely driven by a desire to support a nation that has just suffered a massive, graphic, and morally reprehensible attack.“Over the last week, what we have seen come out of Washington, DC, is overwhelming vitriol — vitriolic hostility toward Palestinians. I worked in this movement for about 13 years, and I have been blown back by some of what I’ve seen and heard from our own elected officials,” Miller said. “Our own government is currently working to support mass atrocities being committed by the Israeli government. That’s essentially the state of affairs right now in DC.”That perspective is what makes progressive activists feel like their efforts are all the more urgent: If more war crimes and atrocities are imminent, they need to act now.Washington’s official consensus has long been strong support for Israel; that stretches across the overwhelming majority of both elected Republicans and Democrats. Criticism of Israel, its occupation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza, and its treatment of Palestinians in general, has long been taboo — and usually limited to the most progressive wing of the Democratic Party.For progressive activists, the first congressional resolution circulated in the wake of the Hamas attack and Israel’s military response is evidence of this institutional bias. The four-page statement, introduced by the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee three days after the attack, has massive bipartisan support — over 400 members of Congress have signed onto it. It condemns Hamas, is a statement of resolute support for and solidarity with the state of Israel, and mourns American and Israeli lives lost — all of which made sense in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Yet the statement makes no mention of Palestinian lives lost since Israel started its campaign of airstrikes in Gaza, and it hasn’t been updated to include the civilian deaths Israel’s military response has caused in the region.“That resolution is going to go down as one of the most shameful resolutions in terms of its timing and its content,” said Miller. “That resolution essentially says that the United States will stand with Israel pretty much no matter what it does, and it only talks about or mourns the loss of Israeli life without even paying lip service to or even acknowledging the fact that the Israeli military has killed Palestinians.”The growing number of civilian deaths in Gaza, coupled with reports of worsening humanitarian conditions and the escalating tactics used by Israel — like cutting off electricity and water to the Gaza Strip and ordering the evacuation of 1 million people to southern Gaza in anticipation of a ground invasion — have all made it easier, and increasingly urgent, for more rank-and-file Democrats to step up their criticism of Israel in the past few days. Earlier this month, a contingent of 17 House Democrats urged the State Department to step up information and resources for Palestinian Americans and American citizens currently stuck in the Gaza Strip.Congressional reactions to media reports of the northern Gaza evacuation order seemed to mark a turning point: Suddenly, more House Democrats felt more comfortable voicing concerns about Israel’s response. That shift contributed to a second House effort on October 13. Led by progressive Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Mark Pocan (D-WI), 55 House Democrats signed a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to remind Israel and neighboring countries that its actions “must be carried out according to international law and take all due measures to limit harm to innocent civilians.” They called for the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to bring aid into Gaza and allow Palestinians and other civilians out of the Strip, and asked that humanitarian aid be ensured for “both Palestinians in Gaza and Israelis,” among other requests.But that statement came short of calling for a ceasefire, which left-leaning activists are now demanding, in part over fears that such a call would drive down the number of Democrats who eventually signed on to the letter, according to a report from the Intercept. Ultimately, 13 of the most progressive Democrats would introduce their own resolution centered on a ceasefire and recognition of the civilian lives lost in both Gaza and Israel.This marks a major change from the way Congress was operating in the days after the Hamas attack, when a Fox News reporter chased Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib — the only Palestinian American member of Congress — around the basement tunnels of the US Capitol asking her to condemn Hamas, and when other members of Congress were criticizing progressives for raising concerns about Israel’s response. Few Democrats chose to defend their colleagues; some angrily confronted them or criticized them in the press. Some took the time to cut ties with leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which had immediately expressed solidarity with Palestinians after the Hamas attack and whose New York City chapter had been linked to an at-times antisemitic protest in Times Square that weekend. DSA-backed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned that protest, and allies of Rep. Jamaal Bowman told the New York Times that the congressman was no longer a DSA member. Rep. Shri Thanedar, another DSA-backed progressive, similarly condemned the demonstration and disassociated himself with the group.Thanedar, a self-described progressive, also told Vox last week that calls for de-escalation and a ceasefire were premature: “Now is not the time to talk about restraint; this is the time to go after the terrorists and Israel is justified in sending the message that such terroristic acts will not be tolerated.”The same sentiment was echoed by the White House last Tuesday. When Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about congressional progressives’ statements calling for a ceasefire, she said the White House believed they are “wrong,” “repugnant,” and “disgraceful.” “Our condemnation belongs squarely with terrorists who have brutally murdered, raped, kidnapped hundreds — hundreds of Israelis,” Jean-Pierre said. “There can be no equivocation about that. There are not two sides here. There are not two sides.”No progressive groups or activists who spoke with Vox were claiming there were two sides to the killing of civilians by Hamas in Israel — but they all agree that there should be no equivocation about the thousands of civilian deaths and injuries in Gaza since Israel launched its air campaign in response.They all condemned Hamas’s atrocities against civilians. They say that at this point in the conflict their fears of a potential “genocide” in the Gaza Strip should be the most immediate concern. They point to the hawkish and violent rhetoric coming from political leaders in both Israel and the US as signs that military restraint is off the table, that concern for civilian lives is not a factor, and that few Democratic and essentially no Republican leaders care about the rising civilian death toll in Gaza since Israel began its military operations.“Most mainstream, responsible, progressive, humane voices are doing everything they can to raise the alarm about the possibility of mass, indiscriminate violence in Gaza,” Simone Zimmerman, a co-founder of the progressive American Jewish organization IfNotNow and an organizer with the Diaspora Alliance, an organization working to fight antisemitism, told Vox. “Most of us are just really trying to call on anyone who will listen to try to help move the situation towards de-escalation and to stop the Israeli government from perpetuating mass atrocities on 2 million people who do not deserve to die.”In the immediate term, Zimmerman and other organizers said that they want more American leaders to forcefully condemn the killing of civilians, emergency response workers, journalists, and United Nations personnel by Israeli strikes in Gaza. They are shocked that more Democrats have not spoken out about Israel cutting off water and power to the Strip, about the fate of American citizens in Gaza, or the long-expected Israeli military ground incursion. They’d like some acknowledgement of Palestinian lives lost in addition to Israeli lives. They demand an end to “collective punishment.” And they urge Western leaders to be careful with just how much of a blank check they are willing to give the Israeli government.In the long run, progressive activists and organizers say they still stand by a more nuanced position for the US to be critical of Israel’s unequal treatment of Palestinian people, of the occupation of Palestinian territory in Gaza and the West Bank, and of American military support that ignores human rights violations. And they hope more progressive lawmakers amplify that message in Washington. “This situation is also clear evidence of why the US needs to do more to prioritize and address resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that means securing self-determination and safety and freedom for both the Israeli and Palestinian people,” said Logan Bayroff, the communications director for the liberal Israeli American group J Street. “Those sentiments can coexist with full-throated, unequivocal condemnation of Hamas slaughtering civilians and support for Israel trying to counter Hamas.”These activist groups are now working to make their section of the American left the one best heard in DC and around the country; the Monday protest at the White House and Wednesday’s protest on Capitol Hill were a way of doing this. But they weren’t the voices picked up by news outlets, politicians, commentators, and social media in the immediate aftermath of the attack. In the days after October 7, a combination of right-wing broadsides and the radical responses from a swath of self-described leftists made it harder for them to get their message to the public and to government leaders. It’s hard to quantify just how big the contingent of war-crime apologists in the American left is, but the fact that it was even a topic of conversation is evidence of the problem other left-leaning activists have to overcome.Those extreme reactions — the ones that called the massacre of civilians a legitimate and “desperate” form of resistance, the ones that appeared to stand with Hamas, the ones that celebrated the deaths of concertgoers  — have already gotten plenty of coverage.Many right-wing media commentators, conservative politicians, and pro-Israel hardliners seized on the more provocative left-wing reactions to conflate apologists for Hamas’s war crimes with critics of the Israeli status quo more broadly. In attacking the White House response, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), for example, has spent much of the last week promoting statements from these leftist groups and referencing “Israel-hating leftist activists” and “rampant, unchecked antisemitism” when criticizing the White House’s response, highlighting a since-deleted State Department statement urging “restraint” and attacking progressive Congress members’ calls for a ceasefire. Fox News host Sean Hannity spent the top of his Wednesday night show using those radical reactions to attack the Democratic Party as a whole. And thought piece after thought piece has meditated on what the future of the activist left could be after the flawed and splintered response.  “There is a desire from some to use these moments of tragedy as an excuse to try to cut off any serious policy debate or discussion … to try to use this as an excuse to label anybody who expresses any support whatsoever for Palestinian rights, for Palestinian statehood, any opposition to ongoing occupation, as somehow you being a hater of Israel, a supporter of Hamas, an antisemite,” said Bayroff.Meanwhile, the nuanced, unequivocal statements by progressive groups like Win Without War, Indivisible, J Street, IfNotNow, the Adalah Justice Project, and the Center for International Policy did not get picked up in the same way as those more radical voices promoted on social media — something progressive leaders wanted to contrast with the statements by more fringe groups.As Israel’s response continues, as horrific stories of death and destruction trickle out, and as the pro-Israel majority in Washington carries on, progressive politicians and activists face an asymetric challenge: holding their left-wing coalitions together, winning over more on the center-left of elected power, beating back attacks from the political right, and doing it all with a political and media environment that is stacked against them.Republicans are united in support of whatever Israel does. Amid the fixation on leftist campus activists and social media posts, lawmakers are openly calling for war crimes: Republican senators like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida have used extreme rhetoric. Graham urged Israel to “level” Gaza while Rubio said Israel should destroy Hamas by whatever means necessary  (“This tragically necessary effort will come at a horrifying price,” he said on X, formerly known as Twitter). Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) has said Israel shouldn’t be held responsible for civilian deaths: “As far as I’m concerned, Israel can bounce the rubble in Gaza. Anything that happens in Gaza is the responsibility of Hamas,” he said on Sunday. So far, they seem to have escaped official opprobrium. Though more House Democrats have spoken up, few in the Senate, with notable exceptions like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Ed Markey (D-MA), have spoken up to urge restraint.That status quo “is a much bigger problem because, while there may be some fringe elements on campuses or at rallies who are saying horrific things about Hamas, we have people saying horrific things about Palestinians at the highest levels of our government in both parties, or they’re turning a blind eye toward it,” Waleed Shahid, the former spokesperson for the progressive political organization Justice Democrats, told Vox. “Jamaal Bowman, AOC, other progressive leaders, have condemned what happened at this rally in New York and what happened with this group in Chicago, [but] I haven’t heard Joe Biden or Hakeem Jeffries, or anyone condemn what Lindsey Graham said or what Netanyahu has said repeatedly about the Palestinian people.”And that asymmetry, some activists said, extends to whose stories get told in national news coverage. “There’s this obsessive one-sided fixation on Israeli victimhood and lengthy interviews with Israeli parents, while Palestinian families are entirely ignored, even though they’re being decimated,” said Omar Baddar, the former communications director for the Institute for Middle East Understanding. “To ignore that, I think ... is a travesty. And right-wing media should be called out for their absolutely racist coverage and their selective outrage for some victims and not others.”These calls for restraint, for de-escalation, for humanitarian aid and forceful condemnation of the killing of civilians “aren’t a very radical position,” said Sandra Tamari, a Palestinian American organizer in St. Louis, Missouri, who leads the Adalah Justice Project. “Right now, the demands are very simple: stop the bombs and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza so that more people don’t die.”The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Sigal Samuel answers 8 key questions about the Chinese crackdown on Uighur Muslims,2019-04-30,Vox,['Lautaro Grinspan'],"Filed under:Future Perfect reporter Sigal Samuel has spent the past year investigating the humanitarian crisis in western China. Over the past year, Vox Future Perfect reporter Sigal Samuel has been investigating China’s campaign of repression against Uighur Muslims, 1 million of whom are being held in internment camps in the northwestern Xinjiang region. On April 26, Sigal did a Reddit Ask Me Anything session, discussing everything from the actions civilians in the US can take to help the Uighurs to the international community’s response to the crisis. Here’s a roundup of some of the most interesting questions and answers, lightly edited for clarity.Stanislav1: Can you give us a quick history lesson on how this started in China?Sigal: China has been worried for a long time that the Uighurs will want to split off from China and make Xinjiang an independent homeland (a lot of Uighurs refer to Xinjiang as East Turkestan). The Chinese paint the Uighurs as a separatist threat as well as a terrorist threat. So they claim “de-extremification” in camps is necessary for national security. There’s more background in this link, which you might find useful.Capitalist_Model: Why are they targeting a fringe and such a specific religion?Sigal: For China, it’s not fringe. The Uighurs are concentrated in Xinjiang, a very important region, both because it’s oil- and resource-rich and because it’s geographically central to China’s huge new infrastructure project, the Belt and Road initiative. China feels it needs to have tight control over Xinjiang; otherwise, that project could be jeopardized. And China has long feared that separatist Uighurs will try to create an independent homeland in Xinjiang. NYLaw: Is there any evidence of violence used in these camps in order to “re-educate” the Uighur folks who are unfortunately subjected to internment? How badly are they being treated?Sigal: Unfortunately, all the evidence suggests that violence is being used and that the conditions in the camps are very bad. There have been reports of torture and death. We know this from detainees who’ve made it out of the camps, and from former guards there. You can also get a sense of what goes on in the camps by examining the lists of equipment that the Chinese government agencies order for the camps — in one case, that included 2,768 police batons, 550 electric cattle prods, 1,367 pairs of handcuffs, and 2,792 cans of pepper spray.uproxx4tron: Have you collected any evidence from the camps yourself?Sigal: I haven’t seen the camps firsthand, but I’ve seen video from inside the camps and have seen Chinese government documents, construction bids, social media posts, etc. I really recommend checking out the work of scholars like Adrian Zenz and Timothy Grose, Uighur activists like @uyghur_nur on Twitter, and on-the-ground reporters like Josh Chin of the Wall Street Journal. Here’s one paper by Zenz that I think is especially illuminating. hankhillforprez: What has been the response from the broader Muslim world, and specifically from governments such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan?Sigal: The response from the broader Muslim world has been pretty muted on the whole. There have been a few exceptions. Malaysia and Indonesia have criticized China for the camps. Turkey released an unusually strong statement in February slamming China. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince has actually defended China’s “right” to place Uighurs in these camps, in the name of “national security.”LivingAncientHistory: If the Chinese Communist Party is effectively trying to de-Islamicize and de-Uighurize Xinjiang, then their policies of choice seem not only crude and ineffective, but potentially leading to the very opposite outcome: repression on ethnic lines leads inevitably to an invigoration of national feeling, with varying degrees of violence (Korea, Catalonia, East Timor, Palestine, Kashmir). Do you suspect this could actually be a strategy of the CCP to elicit violence in Xinjiang (e.g., suicide bombers and the like) in order to justify even more aggressive policies of repression and ethnic cleansing in the future? Or are they just really, really obtuse?Sigal: I agree this will be an extremely ineffective strategy, and worse, it’s likely to backfire. This is what sociologists call “reactive ethnicity” — when you have a policy to ban a practice, so people double down on it in protest. My best guess is that China is not instituting this policy with the specific intention of eliciting violence, but that they really are seeking to indoctrinate (we’ve seen China use this strategy before, toward Falun Gong). But there’s not much point in speculating either way, I suspect.TanktopSamurai: Do you think the way Muslims were presented in the Western media plays a role in the Western lack of popular response?Sigal: Yes. I was really dismayed to see that when I published an article about how China is likening Islam to a mental illness, a lot of people on social media responded saying they agree with China.One thought experiment I think is worth doing: How would the world respond if this were a story about a million Christians being locked up in internment camps? I’m pretty sure the global response to such a crisis would be unhesitating. _BindersFullOfWomen_: Who came up with the descriptor of “internment camps”? Was it China or rather news agencies once they started reporting on it? I only ask because what I’ve seen and read about the camps likens them more to concentration camps of Germany in World War II than the Japanese internment camps established under FDR.Sigal: Good question. Academic researchers and news agencies started using the term “internment camps” (and I use this term in my own reporting). For a long time, China was insisting that the camps are just innocent “vocational schools,” so the goal was to make clear they are not that. Some academics I interviewed told me they actually think the term “concentration camp” is more accurate here (and considering the electric cattle prods and other methods that are being used in the camps, there’s a solid argument to be made for that), but that they have so far avoided using the term because they didn’t want the public to think they were just being hyperbolic.BrownBetaMale: Do you think there is any way for the international community to do anything about this? China is so economically tied to so many powerful countries that it seems doubtful anybody would step up and stop them.Sigal: I think you’re right that China’s economic power is a big reason why the international response has been so muted. Here in the US, folks can call or write to their representatives to let them know this is a humanitarian crisis they care about and want to see political action on. They can show support for the Xinjiang Uyghur Human Rights Act, a bipartisan bill that recommends considering several responses to China’s crackdown, including imposing sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the camps.I also think there are things people can do to support Uighurs in the diaspora. As China is trying to erase their culture back home, Uighurs in the US and Europe are trying to make sure their kids will learn the Uighur language, for example at Ana Care Uighur Language School in Fairfax, Virginia. People can support those institutions. Another thing I’ve found really gutting is that with so many parents in internment camps now, a lot of Uighur students in the US are no longer getting financial help from them. In some cases, the students were relying on their parents’ help to pay for college. People can consider starting a scholarship fund to help out.Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

"What are settlements, and why are they such a big deal?",2018-11-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Since Israel’s occupation of the West Bank began in 1967, Israelis have been traveling there in groups to live in settlements.Editor’s note, November 9, 2023: This story has been updated to reflect details of the current Israel-Hamas war. For all of Vox’s latest coverage on Israel and Palestine, see our storystream.Settlements are communities of Jews who have been moving to the West Bank since it came under Israeli occupation in 1967. Some of the settlers move there to claim the West Bank territory as Israeli land, while others move because the housing is cheap and subsidized. Settlements are generally considered to be a major impediment to peace because they disrupt the continuity of Palestinian land, displace Palestinians, and create a constituency opposed to Israeli land concessions.About 700,000 Israelis live in the settlements, of which there are over 200 scattered around the West Bank. A significant percentage of settlers live on or near the West Bank border with Israel, where (like all settlers) they are protected by members of the Israel Defense Forces. Some of the settlements are vast communities that house tens of thousands of people and look like suburban developments. Some look like hand-built shanty outposts. Most settlements benefit greatly from the support of the Israeli government.Settlements are often described by observers of the conflict as creating new “facts on the ground.” They change the situation by splitting Palestinian land and communities, while an increasing number of Israeli Jews put down roots in territory previously meant for Palestinians. So long as enough settlements are placed in the right places, a Palestinian state is geographically non-viable. For many settlers, this is the point: they want the West Bank fully incorporated as Israeli territory and are trying to make that happen. Any two-state solution will require demolishing a significant number of them.The settlements and military occupation required to defend them makes life really difficult for Palestinians. Palestinians are excluded from certain Israeli-only roads and forced to go through a number of security checkpoints to access main roads, urban areas, agricultural land, and services like health care.Most international lawyers (including one asked by Israel to review them in 1967) believe settlements violate the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the transfer of population into occupied territories. Israel’s government disputes that.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
Three 2020 Democrats express concern that attacks against Ilhan Omar will stifle debate on Israel,2019-03-07,Vox,['Tara Golshan'],"Filed under:Warren, Sanders, and Harris all come out in support of Omar.At least three Democratic presidential candidates have come out in support of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), whose recent questioning of pro-Israel lobbying groups and the United State’s political alliance with Israel has come under fire for feeding into anti-Semitic conspiracies.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said the attacks against Omar were “wrong” and “stifling debate.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said “branding criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has a chilling effect on our public discourse.” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) says she worries Omar is being targeted in a way that “may put her at risk.”Tensions within the Democratic Party have been growing over the past week, as Democratic leadership has been under pressure to rebuke Omar’s comments but also avoid falling in line with a conservative campaign to paint Omar, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, as an anti-Semite.The backlash against Omar began when the first-term Congress member from Minnesota tweeted that American politicians’ support for Israel was “all about the Benjamins,” which many saw as directly tied to an anti-Semitic conspiracy about Jewish magnates buying off American politicians. Then in a discussion about the anti-Semitism allegations against her, Omar said she was trying to “talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.” Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, which Omar sits on, called it “a vile anti-Semitic slur”; some Democrats and Republicans interpreted her comment as feeding into a longstanding anti-Semitic trope that Jewish people are disloyal citizens of their own countries. Others 2020 candidates, like Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) took a different tone than Warren, Sanders and Harris. Booker said he found Omar’s comments “disturbing,” while recognizing that some of the attacks against her had “anti-Islamic sentiment.” Gillibrand said that “those with critical views of Israel, such as Congresswoman Omar, should be able to express their views without employing anti-Semitic tropes about money or influence,” also highlighting the hypocrisy in the Republican Party for censuring Omar, but saying “little or nothing” when President Donald Trump “defended white supremacists at Charlottesville.”House Democratic leadership publicly censured Omar for careless word choice in a statement and is planning to hold a vote on a resolution Thursday that rebukes anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and white supremacy (without naming Omar directly). But many more progressive Democrats — including Warren, Harris, and Sanders, who are running for president — are sticking with Omar, calling the attacks an attempt to silence debate on Israel.While support for Israel among Americans remains strong overall, support for Palestine is at an all-time high, according to a February poll from Gallup — primarily driven by liberal Democrats. That’s probably why the most progressive 2020 candidates are coming out in support of Omar — and, more notably, in support of having a debate about Israel policy.“What I fear is going on in the House now is an effort to target Congresswoman Omar as a way of stifling that debate,” Sanders said in a statement. “That’s wrong.”In a statement, Harris said “we all have a responsibility to speak out against anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism, and all forms of hatred and bigotry, especially as we see a spike in hate crimes in America.” She added that there is a difference between criticism of policy and anti-Semitism:But like some of my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, I am concerned that the spotlight being put on Congresswoman Omar may put her at risk. We should be having a sound, respectful discussion about policy. You can both support Israel and be loyal to our country. I also believe there is a difference between criticism of policy or political leaders, and anti-Semitism. At the end of the day, we need a two-state solution and a commitment to peace, human rights, and democracy by all leaders in the region — and a commitment by our country to help achieve that.Warren took a similar tack. In a statement, she said:We have a moral duty to combat hateful ideologies in our own country and around the world — and that includes both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia,” the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement. “In a democracy, we can and should have an open, respectful debate about the Middle East that focuses on policy. Branding criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has a chilling effect on our public discourse and makes it harder to achieve a peaceful solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Threats of violence — like those made against Rep. Omar — are never acceptable.In a 2020 primary where many of the biggest Democratic nominees more or less agree on the big-ticket domestic issues, foreign policy, especially when it comes to Israel, will offer much more room for debate.Omar’s comments certainly provide an early test of how the future of Democratic leadership sees the issue.

"Trump, Gaza, and the ""blank check"" approach to Israel",2018-05-15,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:Trump is transforming America’s Israel policy into something new: completely unconditional support.There was a striking moment in Monday’s White House press conference when deputy press secretary Raj Shah was asked about the Israeli military’s killing of dozens of Palestinian protesters in Gaza.Shah said that Hamas, the Islamist militant group that runs Gaza, was responsible for the Palestinian deaths. That’s true in part, in the sense that Hamas organized the protest, and because at least 10 of the dead were Hamas operatives, but it’s incomplete given that Israeli soldiers appear to have also shot civilians who did not pose an immediate threat.Reporters kept pressing Shah on whether Israel bore any responsibility for its soldiers killing protesters, most of whom were unarmed, and Shah kept denying it. The conversation culminated in an incredibly blunt admission. The Trump administration is essentially fine with Israel responding in whatever way it wants to:REPORTER: So there’s no burden on Israel to do something to sort of rein it in?SHAH: No. We think that we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that Hamas is the one that, frankly, bears responsibility for the dire situation right now in Gaza.This “blank check” approach is not normal. Past presidents, Democrat and Republican alike, responded to outbreaks of Israeli-Palestinian violence by urging restraint and calm — typically putting more blame on the Palestinians, to be sure, but also working to try to limit the Israeli response.President Trump is different. His administration’s response to the Gaza violence, and his decision to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, which added fuel to an already combustible situation, suggests a major break with the traditional US approach. Trump is pioneering a new, hardline pro-Israel stance — one that fits comfortably in today’s Republican Party and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.“Even Reagan criticized Israel. Trump seems to be in lockstep with Bibi,” says Guy Ziv, a professor of international relations at American University, using a common nickname for Netanyahu. President Obama’s issues with the Israeli government, and Netanyahu in particular, were well known. But even presidents with a reputation for being strongly pro-Israel, such as George W. Bush, took a more tempered approach than Trump has.In December 2008, outright war between Israel and Hamas erupted after months of Hamas sporadically firing rockets into Israel from Gaza. Bush’s official statement blamed Hamas for the outbreak of violence, but it also said the United States was “leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire.” Then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice similarly called for an end to the violence “as soon as possible” and led a negotiating effort aimed at stopping both the war and the rocket fire that gave rise to it.The situation today is different than in 2008: Israeli soldiers aren’t facing an opposing military with tanks and rockets, but rather mostly civilian protesters — some armed with rocks and Molotov cocktails — mixed in with an unknown number of Hamas fighters. If anything, you’d expect the US government to be calling on more restraint from Israel in this situation rather than that one.But the Trump administration has gone further out on a limb in Israel’s favor than Bush did. It’s not just Shah’s comments; in a speech on Tuesday, Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley declared that “no country” in a similar situation “would act with more restraint than Israel has.” When the Palestinian UN envoy started speaking at the UN session, Haley walked out.The Trump policy is clear: Israel will face no pressure from America to moderate its aggressive response.This kind of position, acting as Israel’s advocate rather than its ally, is the emerging norm for Trump. His ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, is a hard-right pro-Israel advocate who once wrote that the two-state solution is “a suicidal ‘peace’ with hateful radical Islamists hell bent on Israel’s destruction.”The administration has seemingly abandoned early efforts to try to convince Israel to curb illegal settlement activity in the West Bank, and the Trump administration’s mystery peace plan, still supposedly being drafted by son-in-law Jared Kushner, is reportedly tilted toward Israel’s view of the conflict.Perhaps the most fundamental sign of Trump’s new hardcore policy is the Jerusalem embassy move itself. Israel’s government is seated in Jerusalem. However, the US put its embassy in Tel Aviv instead to avoid giving the appearance of prejudging the city’s final status in any peace deal, given that both the Israelis and the Palestinians claim it as their capital. In 1995, the US Congress passed a law requiring the US to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city. However, every US president since then has issued a waiver blocking the move from taking place on national security grounds. Since Jerusalem is one of the major flashpoints in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the logic went, moving the US Embassy there would be an unnecessary provocation and could damage the United States’ credibility as a fair arbiter in mediating the conflict.Trump ignored all of these fears and moved the embassy anyway. It was a huge concession to Israel’s current government, one of the most right-wing on Palestinian issues in recent memory. Yet Trump didn’t seem to get much if anything out of it: As far as we know, Israel hasn’t agreed to give up anything (to either the US or the Palestinians) in exchange for the US recognition of Jerusalem as its capital.This looks less like a smart negotiating tactic and more like unconditional support for Israel, well beyond what past presidents were willing to give. All four of Trump’s recent predecessors — Obama, Bill Clinton, and the two Bushes — had taken steps to tangibly punish Israeli governments when its actions threatened American foreign policy priorities or the peace process. These ranged from withholding financial assistance to denying requests for advanced military weapons to publicly condemning its actions.It’s hard to imagine Trump doing the same.When I spoke with Ziv, the American University professor, about the Trump administration’s hardline position on Gaza, he pointed to Trump’s support base as the key reason for it. Trump, he suggested, isn’t pioneering a new Israel policy; rather, he’s bringing American policy in line with the position Republican donors and activists have held for quite some time.There’s been a remarkable surge in pro-Israel sentiment among Republicans over the past several decades. Gallup polling shows that in 1988, 47 percent of Republicans and 42 percent of Democrats took Israel’s side in the conflict with the Palestinians. Today, that figure is roughly similar for Democrats (49 percent) — but dramatically higher for Republicans (87 percent):This is a relatively modern development — one directly linked to the rise of evangelical Protestants in the GOP, whose beliefs about biblically granted rights to the Holy Land make them inclined to take a strongly pro-Israel stance.“Evangelicals were not politically active until about the 1970s,” Elizabeth Oldmixon, a professor at the University of North Texas who studies Israel’s role in American politics, told me back in 2015. “Uncompromising support for Israel is something you start to see as evangelicals become more prominent in the party.”Evangelical conservatives tend to frame the conflict in religious, rather than national or political, terms: The land is Jewish by divine right. “Evangelicals interpret the Bible literally,” Oldmixon explains, “so God’s [biblical] promise to give Palestine to the Jewish people — that’s an eternally valid promise.”Because many evangelicals believe God promised the land to Israel, they see Israelis as unerringly in the right in their conflict with the Palestinians, Iran, or other Muslim neighbors. The Israeli occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza are less of an issue for them than they are for many Democrats, liberal Jews, and even many Israelis.What’s more, the post-9/11 conflict focus on Islamist terrorism among conservative thinkers transformed the stakes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — from a dispute over land to part of a worldwide struggle against the evil of “radical Islam.” Taking a hardline pro-Israel stance wasn’t just an evangelical project but also a conservative one — one that any Republican who wanted to be in good standing with the base needed to embrace. The Bush administration reflected this rightward tilt to some degree, but also took the idea of the US as an honest broker in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations at least somewhat seriously. That meant being willing to, at least at times, criticize Israel’s actions and work to end military hostilities between the two sides.Trump has little respect for the traditional norms of American politics and foreign policy. He came to power in a Republican Party where hardcore support for Israel is a matter of faith, literally and figuratively. Trump is merely bringing US foreign policy in line with Republican partisan rhetoric.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
"""He took the job and made it smaller"": how Rex Tillerson failed the State Department",2017-09-20,Vox,['Zack Beauchamp'],"Filed under:One of the worst secretaries of state in US history may be heading out the door.Rex Tillerson’s disastrous tenure as secretary of state may finally be coming to an end.The New York Times reports that the White House is planning to fire Tillerson and replace him with current CIA Director Mike Pompeo sometime in the next few weeks.  This wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing. The consensus among foreign policy observers is that Tillerson’s time as secretary of state has been an unmitigated disaster.“Tillerson would be at or near the bottom of the list of secretaries of state, not just in the post-Second World War world but in the record of US secretaries of state,” says Paul Musgrave, a scholar of US foreign policy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.The former Exxon Mobil CEO — whose nomination was initially greeted warmly by prominent foreign policy hands — has failed to wield any significant influence in internal administration debates over issues like Syria, North Korea, or Russia.His push to slash “inefficiencies” in the State Department and seeming disinterest in working closely with longtime staff were even more damaging. By failing to get people into vital high-level posts and actively pushing out talented personnel, he ended up making America’s response to major crises incoherent and weakening the State Department for a “generation,” according to George Washington University’s Elizabeth Saunders.This can’t all be blamed on Tillerson: Even a skilled and experienced diplomat would have had trouble maintaining influence in the chaotic Trump White House, where people like UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Jared Kushner wield major influence and foreign policy is often made by tweet. Yet both nonpartisan experts and high-ranking State Department appointees in the past two administrations believe he personally deserves much of the blame.""I think he really will go down as one of the worst secretaries of State we've had,"" Eliot Cohen, counselor to the State Department under President George W. Bush, told Axios’s Jonathan Swan. “He will go down as the worst secretary of state in history,” tweeted Ilan Goldenberg, an Obama-era official who worked on Israel-Palestine issues.Tillerson was expected by many to be one of the “adults in the room,” helping Secretary of Defense James Mattis rein in some of Trump’s most wild ideas. His attempts to play that role backfired, and his ham-handed attempts to manage Trump alienated the president, who has reportedly complained about Tillerson’s “totally establishment” views on foreign policy. Combining the lack of influence over Trump with his single-minded, personal pursuit of State Department “reform” — which really amounted to gutting the department and forcing out longtime employees — you have a truly disastrous tenure in Foggy Bottom.“He took the job and made it smaller,” Musgrave says.When Trump announced Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state back in December 2016, the foreign policy community was of two minds on the appointment. As CEO of Exxon Mobil, one of the world’s largest corporations, Tillerson seemed to be more than qualified to effectively manage a sprawling bureaucracy like the State Department. Mainstream GOP foreign policy experts like former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley all praised the pick.""He would bring to the position vast knowledge, experience, and success in dealing with dozens of governments and leaders in every corner of the world,” Gates said in a statement. ""He is a person of great integrity whose only goal in office would be to protect and advance the interests of the United States.”Critics, though, worried about Tillerson’s close relationship with Vladimir Putin, and about Exxon’s willingness to strike deals with corrupt foreign dictators and history of lobbying against action climate change (though the corporation now says it accepts climate science). During Tillerson’s January confirmation hearings, senators grilled him about both Russia and climate, with Democrats clearly unsatisfied by his answers.""Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question or refuse to answer my question?"" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) puffed, after Tillerson repeatedly stonewalled his questions about Exxon funding climate change denial. ""A little of both,” Tillerson replied.Tillerson was confirmed in late January nonetheless, in a vote that basically fell along party lines. Quickly, he set about upending everyone’s views about him. As early as March, it had become clear that the conventional wisdom was 100 percent wrong. The fears about Tillerson’s policy views had proven overblown, mostly because he had been completely overshadowed in internal White House deliberations over issues like Syria and Russia.“More than a month after he became America’s top diplomat, Rex Tillerson is like no other modern secretary of State: he’s largely invisible,” the LA Times’s Tracy Wilkinson reported at the time. “His influence at the White House is difficult to discern. He appears to be competing with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and Stephen Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, both of whom have Trump’s ear on foreign policy.”The optimism about Tillerson’s management acumen, by contrast, had clearly been badly misplaced. Tillerson failed to fill a number of vital leadership positions, spent almost no time interacting with his own employees, and pushed out long-serving career professionals without clear replacements in mind. Morale inside the organization collapsed.“I used to love my job,” one staffer told the Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe at the time. “Now, it feels like coming to the hospital to take care of a terminally ill family member. You come in every day, you bring flowers, you brush their hair, paint their nails, even though you know there’s no point. But you do it out of love.”What was true in March remained true for the rest of Tillerson’s time in office to date. On issue after issue, Tillerson proved to be out of touch with the president’s foreign policy positions. The US bombed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in early April — just days after Tillerson suggested the administration would be fine with Assad staying in power. On June 9, Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and its allies to end their isolation of Qatar; less than two hours later, Trump sided with the Saudis by labeling Qatar “a funder of terrorism at a very high level.”The staffing problem at the State Department has gotten worse as time has gone on. By mid-September, only 24 of 148 political appointees had confirmed by the Senate, according to a count by the Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service. Tillerson had not nominated anyone to be the assistant secretary supervising vital regions like Asia and the Middle East, nor had he nominated ambassadors for countries as important as Saudi Arabia and South Korea. This kind of vacancy is devastating. Political appointees are necessary to shape policy, as they serve as a conduit between the administration and foreign governments. Without people in these positions, career diplomats fill in as best they can, but they have a hard time making new decisions or formulating new policy. It’s nigh unprecedented to go this long with this many vacancies because it cripples America’s ability to develop diplomatic stances on vital issues. And it’s not like this was a quiet time for foreign policy. During Tillerson’s tenure, North Korea has tested both a ballistic missile that could theoretically hit Washington and its largest nuclear device ever. One US ally in the Gulf (Saudi Arabia) laid economic siege to another (Qatar). And the US bombed Bashar al-Assad in Syria for the first time.Even the career staff has suffered under Tillerson. He eliminated entire segments of the department, like the department that tracked war crimes. He imposed limits on transfers inside the organization, typically a way the State Department deals with staffing shortages, in late June. He cut off the department from vital recruiting sources, like the Presidential Management Fellow program. He publicly defended a Trump administration proposal to cut his department’s budget by 30 percent, and devised a plan to cut the permanent staff by 8 percent.He attempted to defend these ideas in a September meeting with members of Congress by use of a PowerPoint presentation outlining his vision for the department — which he could theoretically use to say he finished his reorganization plan and can now hand it over to others to carry out. The slides are chock-full of management jargon. In one section, titled “Description of Redesign Workstreams,” Tillerson promised to “identify ways to promote an agile and empowered workforce as part of an overarching talent map.” This presentation did not persuade Congress, which has repeatedly rebuffed Tillerson’s requests to cut State’s budget. But it is emblematic of Tillerson’s style, in a way that shows how he managed to alienate his own employees so thoroughly.“Secretary Tillerson’s term has led to widespread demoralization in the foreign service, the dismissal or resignation of people with expertise that individually may not be irreplaceable but as a cohort certainly becomes so,” Musgrave says. “That hinders the State Department’s ability to enhance US interests through diplomacy.”The consequences may not be visible immediately. But State’s personnel shortages could prevent the United States from successfully reaching a diplomatic solution to issues in everything ranging from the South China Sea to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You can’t negotiate very well if you don’t have people who know how to do it — and the more people the State Department loses, the longer-term the consequences of these problems are, as there’s no one to promote to senior roles.Saunders analogizes the US under Tillerson’s emaciated State Department to a person who doesn’t have health insurance. “Your life is probably fine — up until the point you get sick,” she says.Why did things go so wrong for Tillerson?Some of the blame has to be laid at his boss’s feet. Trump is running a chaotic administration that has nominated a shockingly low number of political appointees across practically every department. The White House shot down so many of Tillerson’s picks for top deputies that he actually screamed at a group of White House aides during a late June meeting out of frustration. Trump personally displayed little to no interest in learning from the expertise of State Department personnel, preferring instead to delegate foreign policy to Kushner and occasionally announce policy shifts via tweet.“It may be that in a Trump administration, the structural realities of the way the White House works [mean] you can only choose among varieties of failure,” Musgrave says.But that excuse only goes so far. Secretary of Defense Mattis hasn’t been immune to Trump’s bizarre management style, either — he was blindsided, most notably, by Trump’s proposal to ban transgender people from serving in the military. But on the whole, Mattis has been far more effective at advocating for his department’s interests and gaining influence over the president’s decision-making than Tillerson.That’s partly because Trump has more respect for generals than diplomats. Another part of it is that Mattis seems better at handling Trump’s mercurial nature; according to the New York Times, Tillerson frequently annoyed the president in meetings by (among other things) saying “It’s your deal” whenever Trump overruled him.But a third and vital part of it, experts say, is that Mattis — a career military professional and former general — is substantially better at working in Washington. In particular, Mattis understands that working closely with his staff in the Pentagon allows him to advance policy ideas through the bureaucracy.“Mattis is drawing on the expertise of his building. Some of that is a product of [his own] experience,” Saunders says. “Tillerson is not a creature of his building, nor is he a creature of government at all.”By most accounts, Tillerson failed to build relationships with people in Foggy Bottom, relying instead on an insular inner circle made up of a few longtime confidants. This decision “constitutes the core of his failure,” according to Musgrave: It made it hard for Tillerson to garner influence inside the White House and to understand what his staff could do and how to deploy them effectively.“Tillerson had a half-dozen, maybe a dozen, aides who are not familiar with Washington and especially not familiar with the State Department,” Musgrave says. “But he seems to rely on these people who are loyal to him, known to him, at the expense of building relationships with the people in the building.”Perhaps if Tillerson had developed closer relationships with State’s career staff, he would have understood that supporting budget cuts to his own department and staff downsizing would demoralize them. Perhaps he would have been able to develop new ideas that would have gotten the president’s ear. Perhaps he would have been more able to convince the White House to trust his judgment on political appointees.Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. But the truth is we won’t know because Tillerson, to a degree nearly unprecedented in State’s history, failed to even try to work with his own department — turning his term into both a tragedy and a farce.This raises an obvious, if strange, question: Why did this multimillionaire leave his cushy job at the head of one of the world’s largest corporations to lead a government bureaucracy he didn’t understand and seemingly didn’t respect?It’s a question only Tillerson can answer.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
The Israel-Hamas war is exposing Europe’s divisions,2023-11-11,Vox,['Jen Kirby'],"Filed under:Brussels is on the sidelines, but it’s not insulated from the conflict’s fallout.In late October, as the war in Gaza intensified, all 27 European Union leaders reiterated their condemnation of Hamas’s attack on Israel and reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend itself. They also expressed “gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza’’ and emphasized the need for aid access, “including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs.”This was supposed to be the EU’s unified stance on the conflict in the Middle East. Reaching it took five hours and was seen as so sensitive phones were kept out of the room, according to a report in Politico.That same week, at the United Nations, Europe split on a Gaza ceasefire resolution. Countries like Spain, Ireland, and France voted for it. Germany and Italy, among others, abstained. Austria, Hungary, and Czechia all voted against. Despite Europe’s best efforts, its divisions were on display.“It is these divisions which make it hard for the EU to take a strong, united common position,” said Martin Konečný, director of the European Middle East Project (EuMEP), an independent, Brussels-based organization. “They can agree on a position on paper, but it’s kind of a minimum common denominator, and it doesn’t allow the EU to very forcefully push for something.”Europe, as a whole, has been traditionally seen as seeking a balanced approach to Israel and Palestine, in part because it has had to navigate different public debates and different national sensitivities. At times, this has generated more nuanced discourse, but not necessarily cohesion or authority to influence the outcome of the conflict. Europe does not offer Israel the kind of security or military aid the United States does, and so does not have the same kind of leverage as Washington there. It also lacks the full trust of Palestinians in a way that exists in many parts of the Muslim world. [Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]Those realities existed before Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israeli civilians but are now exposed amid the current war in Gaza, where Europe may be sidelined from the diplomatic debate but not from the war’s broader fallout. In recent weeks, protests and marches calling for a ceasefire have swept through European capitals. The continent has also seen a troubling spike in antisemitism. Not unlike the United States, the war is splitting Europe’s left, like France’s socialists and the United Kingdom’s Labour Party. (Even if the UK’s not officially in the bloc anymore, the country faces similar dynamics.) Some see Europe as having squandered its position as an honest broker, especially in the Global South, as its more muddled position on Gaza contrasts with its unequivocal condemnation of Russian attacks against Ukraine. The Middle East in chaos — especially if this spirals into a larger regional war — is something Europe wants to avoid. Europe still has influence, especially as an economic power, yet at this stage, the EU is struggling to find its footing. Its big test will be whether it will continue to stumble along or potentially find some meaningful path to help mitigate the crisis.“We have the different sensibilities within the EU, about Israeli and Palestinian concerns, so there the EU may have an advantage over other international players,” said Alexander Loengarov, senior affiliated researcher at the Institute for International Law at KU Leuven in Belgium. “The US is seen as just typically siding with Israel, and many Muslim countries are seen as just siding with the Palestinians. There may be a role for Europe to play.”In the wake of Hamas’s attack in Israel, a European commissioner named Olivér Várhelyi, from Hungary, went rogue, announcing the immediate suspension of aid to Palestine. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, had to do damage control soon after, insisting that aid would not be stopped, while adding that there would be a review to make sure no funds were going to Hamas — even though the EU was already confident none were.It was not the last time Borrell would do this sort of cleanup. His boss, EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen, received pushback after she made an unscheduled trip to Israel in mid-October. Some reportedly bristled that she gave unequivocal support for Israel, and in expressing solidarity with Hamas’s victims, she had failed to urge Israel to follow international law in Gaza.“The official position of the European Union with any foreign policy [issue] is being fixed — I repeat — by the [EU’s official] guidelines,” Borrell said soon after, adding that foreign policy is decided by the leaders of the EU’s 27 members.This small rebuke was not nothing; von der Leyen is Madame Europe and has become something of a symbol of Europe globally, especially around Ukraine. Now her colleague was basically saying, “Actually, she doesn’t speak for the bloc.” All of these were signs of the divisions unspooling at all levels within Europe: within the EU’s leadership, among the governments of individual member-states, and within those member-states’ populations. That has left Europe scrambling to find some degree of unity — or to at least paper over debates and divisions that have exposed how marginalized European influence is in this conflict and find consensus.As experts said, Europe has never had the kind of influence or leverage the United States or regional players have had over Israel and Palestine. Most of Europe’s influence has come in shaping the discourse, using its very specific moral position as a transnational project forged in the aftermath of conflict. “The Europeans have had a somewhat more balanced position than the US and have historically taken the lead before the US on some very important positions, such as recognizing the Palestinian right to self-determination in 1980,” Konečný said. Europe is a top international donor to Palestinian humanitarian and development aid. It has also sought to strengthen trade, technology, and security ties with Israel, especially in the aftermath of Russia’s Ukraine invasion. European courts have required produce from Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land to be labeled as such, but it has never used sanctions (perhaps the EU’s most powerful collective foreign policy tool) to stop the expansion of Israeli settlements. As experts told me, this kind of balancing has sometimes led to the perception among Israelis that Europe is too sympathetic to Palestinian causes, and a perception among Palestinians that it’s too strongly on the side of Israel.A lot of this is shaped by Europe’s internal political dynamics. Germany, for obvious historical reasons, is more strongly pro-Israel. Ireland’s history of occupation and colonization has tended toward more solidarity with the Palestinian cause.During the Cold War, support for Palestine and Israel fell along the East-West divide; many of the former Soviet bloc states still recognize Palestine as a state, even as some — such as Hungary and Czechia — have since become some of the most staunchly pro-Israel voices.Some of this shift came after the fall of the Soviet Union, as these countries moved closer to the US and so mirrored Washington’s embrace of Israel. Some of it has strengthened in recent years as the far right rose in prominence and conservative right-wing leaders in places like Hungary have found kinship with Israel’s right-wing leadership in Benjamin Netanyahu. Before October 7, Europe was committed to a two-state solution, though it may have fallen off as a foreign policy priority for Brussels. Some of this has been influenced by larger geopolitical dynamics, including a war on the continent. But the US’s recent lack of engagement, along with efforts under previous and current administrations to normalize relations between Israel and Arab states, including through the Abraham Accords, also deprioritized the issue in Europe. Now the complexity and the brutality of the conflict, from Hamas’s attack and hostage-taking of Israeli civilians to Israel’s retaliation against Gaza, are revealing the tenuousness of Europe’s position. Europe, especially figures like von der Leyen, came out strongly and unequivocally for Israel. Europe, like the US, has begun calling for humanitarian pauses, but without much heft behind it. Europe is struggling, as the war continues and the civilian death toll in Gaza mounts, with how to effectively respond to Israel’s campaign.Europe — not unlike the United States — is grappling with how its foreign policy toward Israel and Palestine is roiling domestic politics. The choices the bloc is making or not making about the conflict are shaping and exposing fault lines among and within member-states.“I think that many of them are facing increasing internal pressure to moderate their stance and reflect more concern about the Palestinians, and where to go from from here,” said Gerald M. Feierstein, distinguished senior fellow on US diplomacy at the Middle East Institute and former State Department official. Protests in support of a ceasefire have occurred everywhere from Spain to Germany to France to Poland. Governments in France and Germany, both of which have large Muslim populations, have attempted to limit pro-Palestinian protests, citing both security fears and concerns over antisemitism — a legitimate and growing worry across Europe, if not always directly linked to demonstrations. The responses, though, have raised questions about limiting rights and liberties; Diana N., who works with Palästina Spricht (Palestine Speaks) in Berlin, Germany, said, especially in the early days of the conflict, people continued to demonstrate despite the risks and potential reprisals. (She asked to use her last initial only for personal security and privacy concerns.) That may come with future political risks. Europe’s current disarray could marginalize Palestinian or Muslim populations. Europe’s left has also struggled to navigate this moment, including in places like France and the United Kingdom. Already the Israel-Gaza conflict has tested fragile left-wing coalitions in places like France and Spain. Those on the left, in particular, fear this could become a campaign issue, especially for the European parliamentary elections next year, as a weakened, disorganized left could create an even greater opening for a resurgent far right. Some politicians in places like Belgium and Spain — two countries that have tended to be more sympathetic to Palestinian rights — have become increasingly critical of Israel’s approach. “Bombing an entire refugee camp with the intention of taking out one terrorist, I don’t think you can say that is proportional,” Belgium Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said this week. This internal discord is also threatening to spill over into other areas, most notably Europe’s unity and message on Ukraine. Europe, and the West more broadly, have sought to rally the world to Ukraine’s side, especially in the Global South, where the fallout from Russia’s invasion has exacerbated fuel and food prices in places already struggling with poverty and instability. The perception that Europe spoke with clarity on Russian attacks on civilians but has not done so in regards to Gaza has, many observers said, undermined its credibility. “Neither the US nor the EU comes out particularly well,” Feierstein said. “Both will be seen as being pretty hypocritical, frankly.”On November 8, Charles Michel, the European Council president, reiterated Europe’s position: Israel had the right to defend itself, but it must follow international law. A total siege of Gaza was not in line with international law. In the speech, Michel tried to link the conflict back to one where Europe is on more solid ground: He proposed purchasing Ukrainian grain and shipping it to the region, saying it’s “a strong gesture of solidarity and efficiency.”Michel also said Europe had a “role to play in building peace in the region, through our diplomacy, our convening power, our common foreign and security policy instruments, and our role as a trusted global partner.” Europe may seek peace, but it has little ability to get there. As some experts pointed out, Europe could lay out a diplomatic pathway and could be a potential broker, but it does not have the political clout to achieve that on its own. And even if it did, its internal divisions might make that impossible. When it comes to Europe, Diana N. said, “I don’t see that they’re ever going to walk in one direction because the positions are so different.”In October, as the EU struggled for hours to come up with a unified statement, it also proposed an “international peace conference.” Spain had pushed for it, but few inside Europe or outside it think it has any meaning. And that may be Europe’s biggest challenge on Israel and Gaza: Right now, it is mostly words.The day's most important news stories, explained in your inbox.Check your inbox for a welcome email."
