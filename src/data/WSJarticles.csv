"Israel, Hamas Engage in Some of Fiercest Fighting of War",2023-12-04T12:05:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Benoit Faucon', 'Dov Lieber']","TEL AVIV—Israeli troops and Hamas fighters are locked in some of their fiercest fighting of the two-month-old war, including at close quarters, as Israel looks to decisively finish its operations in and around Gaza City while launching its offensive in the south.

The Israeli military has essentially cornered Hamas fighters in two of their last strongholds in the northern Gaza Strip—the Shajaiya neighborhood of Gaza City and the city of Jabalia, immediately to the north.

Israel has conducted heavy airstrikes in those areas since the fighting resumed over the weekend, including one strike that Israeli officials said killed Hamas’s battalion commander in Shajaiya, and which Palestinian officials said caused hundreds of civilian casualties.

At the same time, Israel is turning its attention to the southern city of Khan Younis, the home of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Israel also believes Khan Younis is probably where hostages are being held.

Israel on Monday warned some residents in the south to evacuate ahead of military action that analysts said could be the decisive battle of the war.

“We are now pursuing Hamas in southern Gaza,” Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Monday. “We are pursuing Hamas wherever they are hiding. In the north and the south,” he said.

Israeli commanders have said they are working against a political clock to complete their objectives of removing Hamas from power and freeing more than 100 hostages, worrying that U.S. support will dry up if the war drags on and civilian casualties continue to mount.

More than 15,000 Palestinians have died during Israel’s offensive, authorities in the Hamas-run enclave said, mostly women and children—a figure that doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. Palestinian militants still hold hostages from the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,200 people.

Israel said Monday that its air force had hit roughly 200 Hamas targets across Gaza. In the north, ground operations resumed with fresh intensity, including a raid on what the Israeli military said was Hamas infrastructure, in a school building in northeast Gaza, where they found tunnels.

“The next battles in the north are going to be deadlier than the previous battles,” said Michael Horowitz, the head of intelligence at Le Beck International, a security and risk management consulting firm based in the Middle East.

Ne’ama Hazem, a resident in the center of Gaza City, said bombings late Sunday had been the worst since the beginning of war. “We heard shelling of tanks, warplanes, rockets, armed clashes and sounds of windows breaking all over the neighborhood,” she said.

The Israeli military said the Kfir brigade, which is usually based in the West Bank, is now operating in the northern Gaza Strip, indicating how the military is redeploying and retraining its forces for the current war in Gaza. The military said the brigade was engaged in destroying Hamas’s tunnels, a skill it wouldn’t have used in the West Bank, where militants don’t use tunnels. The military also said soldiers from the brigade were engaged in close combat with militants, indicating a new round of fierce battles in the northern Gaza Strip.

Israeli soldiers trained to operate in the West Bank have much more experience carrying out one-off operations such as arrests or targeted raids, rather than engaging in combat maneuvers like they now face in the Gaza Strip, which Israel pulled out of nearly two decades ago.

The expansion of fighting to the south promises to aggravate what is already a dire humanitarian crisis. Renewed fighting has cut the transit of humanitarian aid—such as flour and water—from the South to Gaza’s central areas, a United Nations agency overseeing the distribution said Monday.

Much of northern Gaza’s population moved south to escape fighting over recent weeks. Roughly 70% of the strip’s population of 2.2 million people is now in the south, with overcrowding and poor living conditions threatening disease outbreaks, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.

The death toll of the war has now risen to 15,899 since the start of the Israeli aggression on the sector, said Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

Fighting in Gaza resumed over the weekend after talks between Israel and Hamas over potential hostage releases stalled. The talks, which also covered the potential release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, broke down after the militants refused to free more hostages unless Israel agreed to a pause in fighting.

In an attempt to break the deadlock, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said her national security adviser, Phil Gordon, would travel to Israel and the West Bank this week for additional discussions.

Israeli military chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, said Sunday that Israel’s military would operate in southern Gaza as it did in the northern part of the enclave. That included a massive ground incursion backed by air, naval and artillery support and an emphasis on killing Hamas’s senior militant commanders. Le Beck said it had identified the presence of Israeli tanks in southern Gaza in footage posted by Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera.

Fighters for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a secular Hamas ally, said Monday they had clashed with the Israeli army east of al-Qarara, a town near Khan Younis.

Fighting is next expected to move to Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, bordering Egypt. Seven people were killed in an airstrike on Rafah late Sunday, a U.N. humanitarian agency said. The dead included local journalist Shaima Al-Jazzar, according to local outlet Quds Channel and London-based broadcaster Alghad TV.

“Even in Rafah, where people are being forced to flee, the sound of airstrikes punctuates the day,” said Thomas White, the director of affairs in Gaza for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. “People are pleading for advice on where to find safety. We have nothing to tell them.”

In a sign of the intensity of new fighting, the level of destruction in Gaza since the war restarted this weekend is higher than during the first month and a half of war, a senior U.N. official told The Wall Street Journal.

Infrastructure, property and other investments valued at roughly $50 billion have been destroyed in fighting since October, equivalent to roughly two decades of development support to Gaza, said Abdallah Al Dardari, the Arab States director at the U.N. Development Program.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Revive Trump’s ‘Vision’ for Israeli-Palestinian Peace,2023-12-03T22:35:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Michael Oren', 'Jason Greenblatt']","By agreeing to exchange a multiday cease-fire for the release of hostages, Israel is likely to come under mounting pressure to accept a more permanent truce. This would enable Hamas to get away with one mass murder while actively preparing for the next. Nevertheless, some policy makers viewed the agreement as a way to end the war, secure the remaining hostages’ freedom and alleviate the Palestinians’ suffering. President Biden has signaled his opposition to a complete pause—but that opposition may not be so steadfast. The White House is reportedly asking Israel to allow more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and agree to a “day after” plan that includes a so-called two-state solution.

Israel can expand aid shipments to Gaza, but it should unequivocally reject the creation of a Palestinian state while Hamas rules Gaza and a corrupt Palestinian Authority controls large parts of the West Bank. A Nov. 14 survey found that 75% of the public in the West Bank and Gaza supports the atrocities of Oct. 7 and wants to eliminate Israel entirely.

Yet if speaking about peace is helpful to Mr. Biden, it’s vital to recall that a U.S. proposal for a realistic two-state solution already exists and was approved by a previous Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu.

The proposal is called “Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People”—or simply the vision. Presented by the Trump administration in 2020, it called for the establishment of a Palestinian state similar in size to the pre-1967 area of the West Bank and Gaza, with unprecedented investment in the Palestinian economy. The vision estimated that within a decade a million new jobs would be created, doubling Palestinian gross domestic product and significantly reducing the poverty rate. The vision provided for the integration of Palestinians into the regional and global economy and for major development projects in Gaza.

Israel, for its part, would receive the security provisions it needs to prevent attacks akin to Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault. Neither Jews nor Palestinians would be forced out of their homes, and both would be given access to their holy sites. Jerusalem would remain united under Israeli sovereignty with a capital created for the Palestinians in its eastern suburbs.

The vision also called for the construction of a high-speed rail line between the West Bank and Gaza, as well as a system of bridges, roads and tunnels between noncontiguous Palestinian territories in the West Bank. The Palestinians would have their own port in Gaza as well as access to Israeli ports, and designated roads would connect the Palestinians to Jordan and the broader Arab world. Under the vision, Palestinians would be able to chart their own destiny, supported by massive sums of money.

Mr. Netanyahu hailed the plan as an opportunity “Israel will not miss,” but Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas rejected it with “a thousand no’s.” The vision, he claimed, would give the Palestinians less land than previous proposals would have and prohibit the Palestinian Authority from paying stipends to reward Palestinian terrorists who attacked or murdered Israelis. Today, in the 19th year of his four-year term, Mr. Abbas opposes the vision’s requirements for democratization.

The Palestinians weren’t alone in rejecting the proposal. Most of the media denounced it as too pro-Israel, despite its several territorial concessions to the Palestinians. Many commentators likewise overlooked that right-wing Israelis rejected the vision precisely because it would result in a Palestinian state—albeit one without full sovereignty and subject to overriding Israeli security control.

Mr. Biden has no doubt satisfied his party’s progressive base by abandoning many of his predecessor’s initiatives. Yet his administration continues to maintain the Abraham Accords, which Mr. Trump forged, and hopes to expand it by creating peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. He ought to extend similar sympathy, and exert equal political capital, to advance the vision.

Talking about peace while Hamas continues to hold more than a hundred people hostage strikes many as tone-deaf. But at least 20 Democratic senators think otherwise and may seek to revive a failed two-state formula. To give Mr. Biden the backing he needs to maintain his principled opposition to a total pause—and provide time and space for Israel to defeat Hamas—the U.S. should renew the vision, at least as the basis for future negotiations. It is the only proposal Israelis might approve if and when the time is right, and it is an opportunity the Palestinians would be wise not to miss.

Tourist Stabbed to Death Near Eiffel Tower in Suspected Terrorist Attack,2023-12-03T02:50:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Matthew Dalton'],"A security patrol in Paris near the scene of Saturday’s attack on a tourist.

PARIS—An Islamist radical stabbed a tourist to death on Saturday evening a few hundred yards from the Eiffel Tower, French authorities said, rattling a nation on high alert because of the Israel-Hamas war.

France’s counterterrorism prosecutor identified the suspected assailant as Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab, a French national in his mid-20s with a long history of Islamist extremism. He was tasered and arrested shortly after the slaying, authorities said. Rajabpour-Miyandoab pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a video he posted on X, formerly Twitter, and expressed his support for jihadists around the Middle East and Africa, said the prosecutor, Jean-François Ricard.

Rajabpour-Miyandoab opened his account on X at the beginning of October and posted frequently about Hamas, the Gaza Strip and Palestine, Ricard said. He spent nearly four years in prison for plotting a terrorist attack in 2016 and was in contact with other Islamist radicals who carried out lethal attacks in France, the prosecutor said.

“He said to the police who arrested him that he could no longer accept that Muslims die in Afghanistan and Palestine,” said the Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin.

European authorities fear the war is stirring Islamist extremists on the continent to carry out attacks. The French government raised the terrorism alert to its highest threat level in October after an Islamist radical stabbed a teacher to death at a high school in the north of France. Prosecutors said the assailant in that case, a refugee from Russia, was motivated by the deaths of Muslims across the world, not specifically in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank.

Europe’s Jewish communities, meanwhile, have faced a surge in antisemitic incidents since the Israel-Hamas war began. Authorities in France, Germany and elsewhere have bolstered police protection of Jewish schools, synagogues and other institutions that have been targets of Islamist radicals.

Rajabpour-Miyandoab’s activity on X could raise new concerns in Europe about extremist content on the social-media platform owned by Elon Musk. European Union authorities in October warned X that it is failing to abide by new rules adopted by the bloc aimed at preventing the spread of misinformation and extremist views.

X didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The victim in Saturday’s attack was a 23-year-old man with dual German-Filipino nationality who was born in the Philippines, authorities said. Rajabpour-Miyandoab attacked him with a knife and hammer at around 9 p.m. next to the Bir-Hakeim Bridge, close to the Eiffel Tower. A taxi driver saw the attack unfolding and yelled at the suspected assailant.

Rajabpour-Miyandoab cried out “Allahu akbar,” lifted his arms to the sky and then fled across the bridge to the other side of the Seine river, said Ricard, the counterterrorism prosecutor. The man then attacked several other people before being subdued by the police. Two people were injured in addition to the one man who was killed, authorities said.

“I send all my condolences to the family and loved ones of the German national who died this evening,” President Emmanuel Macron said early Sunday.

Rajabpour-Miyandoab was born to Iranian parents in the upscale Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, officials said.

“He came from a family without any religious commitments,” Ricard said.

Rajabpour-Miyandoab converted to Islam on his 18th birthday in 2015 and quickly embraced jihadist ideology, Ricard said. He attempted to travel to the Iraq-Syria war zone in 2016 to join Islamic State before being sent to jail in August 2016.

France has struggled to manage the risk posed by thousands of Islamist extremists on its territory. After Rajabpour-Miyandoab left prison in March 2020, he was monitored by French authorities. The surveillance was tightened because of contacts he had with a radical who would go on to decapitate the teacher Samuel Paty in October 2020, a killing that traumatized France.

He was on France’s terror watch list, authorities said, and was required to receive treatment for severe psychiatric problems. In October, his mother signaled to authorities that she was becoming more concerned about the behavior of her son.

“There was no evidence that would have allowed new criminal proceedings in those circumstances,” Ricard said.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Israel Steps Up Attacks in Southern Gaza as Negotiations Stumble,2023-12-02T10:42:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Jared Malsin', 'Summer Said', 'Anat Peled']","Israel’s military intensified attacks on the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday, threatening to unravel negotiations to free more hostages held by Hamas and reinstate a cease-fire that collapsed a day earlier.

Opening what could be the next phase of its war against Hamas militants, Israel’s air force said it carried out an “extensive attack” against militants overnight in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza crowded with displaced people who fled prior weeks of Israeli bombing.

The air force said it carried out 400 strikes over the past day. Palestinians in the area said explosions shook buildings throughout the night, while the director of a large hospital in the city said the emergency room was flooded with casualties. Palestinian militants also fired rockets into Israel.

The renewed fighting came a day after talks to extend the cease-fire collapsed. The truce agreement resulted in the release of more than 100 hostages held by Hamas since its Oct. 7 attack on Israel—in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Officials from Egypt and Qatar mediating in talks between Israel and Hamas have scrambled to renew the cease-fire after the fighting resumed.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—who faces pressure from the families of the remaining hostages held by Hamas to de-escalate and negotiate for the release of more captives—said he ordered Israeli negotiators from the Mossad intelligence service to leave the talks after what his office described as an impasse. Arab officials familiar with the negotiations said the talks continued Saturday.

“We will do everything to bring back everyone,” Netanyahu told reporters late Saturday. He credited military pressure and the negotiations for the return of the hostages. “Just a week ago it looked totally imaginary,” he said.

The stakes of the negotiations are high. If Qatari and Egyptian negotiators fail to reinstate the cease-fire, Israel will likely launch a difficult and deadly new phase of the war in Gaza. Israeli officials have said in recent weeks that they plan to shift military operations to the southern Gaza Strip to pursue their goal of removing Hamas from power after largely routing the group in the north.

Negotiations have stumbled in recent days over disagreement about which hostages would be released. Under the terms previously agreed by the two sides, Hamas had to release roughly 10 hostages each day of the truce. The initial agreement called for civilian women and children to be released first.

In the talks Thursday and Friday, Hamas insisted it didn’t have any more civilian female and children hostages to release and said the women still in captivity were members of the Israeli military, senior Egyptian officials said. Hamas also offered the bodies of two children and their mother, they said.

Israel has resisted a proposal from Qatari and Egyptian mediators to move on to a discussion of other groups of hostages, including civilian men and military reservists, negotiators said.

According to Egyptian officials, mediators were informed Friday night by Israel that the Mossad team stationed in Doha would leave later Saturday. A team of Qatari officials in Israel and an Egyptian team in Gaza remain in their positions, officials said.

“We are still talking and sharing updates every hour. Negotiations only collapse when parties stop talking. This is not happening here,” said one senior Egyptian official.

Families of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza are concerned that the resumption of hostilities will endanger their relatives and are urging the government to continue negotiations. Protests by the families played an instrumental role in persuading Netanyahu to accept the initial cease-fire.

On Saturday, recently freed Israeli hostages called on the Israeli government to secure the release of all remaining captives.

“We must now continue and bring back my Sasha and everyone,” said Lena Troufanov on the stage at a rally in Tel Aviv. Troufanov’s 28-year-old son, Sasha Troufanov, remains in captivity.

Palestinians in Gaza said they feared the coming battle for the south.

“All we want is to preserve what remains of our Gaza,” said Said Yazid Haseeb, 50, a merchant who fled Gaza City during the cease-fire to Deir Albalah, describing “intense and terrifying fiery clashes” in Khan Younis.

For the Israeli military, the battle for the southern Gaza Strip is expected to be even more complex and difficult than in the north. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups—many of whom have fled from the north and are blocked from fleeing over the border into Egypt—will have little choice but to fight advancing Israeli forces. The south is also where most of the 1.8 million displaced Palestinians have fled in recent weeks, seeking safety from the military operation.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel’s forces in the northern Gaza Strip had killed thousands of “terrorists” and captured hundreds more, and had struck Hamas bases and seized massive volumes of intelligence material.

Every Hamas commander “in the Gaza strip understands what happened to the battalions in northern Gaza,” Gallant said in a statement. “They understand what their future holds.”

The U.S. has continued to push the Israelis to limit civilian casualties in their pursuit of Hamas, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated that message Saturday.

“First and foremost, that’s the right thing to do, but it’s also good strategy,” Austin said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif. “In this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”

At the climate conference in Dubai on Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israel to define its goals more precisely.

“The total destruction of Hamas, what is it? And does anyone think it is possible? If so, the war will last 10 years,” he said. “The right response to a terrorist group is not to eliminate an entire territory.”

Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave. The number doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israeli airstrikes have reduced entire apartment blocks to rubble and hit schools and in the vicinities of hospitals. After the cease-fire ended, at least 193 people were killed by Friday night, the Gaza Health Ministry said.

Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel killed more than 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The militants killed partygoers at a music festival and residents of towns along the border with Gaza while taking some 240 people hostage.

Both Israel and the U.S. have rejected calls for a long-term cease-fire favored by the United Nations, Arab countries mediating between the two sides and humanitarian groups struggling to provide enough food, safe drinking water, blankets and other essentials to people in Gaza.

Under pressure from the Biden administration and facing a global outcry about the rising death toll in Gaza, Israel has begun implementing a system that it says is designed to move civilians from place to place within the Gaza Strip while its military battles Hamas.

The system divides the Gaza Strip into hundreds of numbered sectors marked on a map. An Israeli military spokesman tweeted images of the map on Saturday with a demand for Palestinians in a swath of southern Gaza north and east of Khan Younis to move south toward Rafah. In the north, the spokesman told Palestinians to leave parts of Gaza City and neighboring Jabalia.

“For your safety, we call on you to evacuate your homes immediately,” said Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesman, in a post on X, with the maps attached.

Palestinians in Gaza and U.N. officials are skeptical of the plan, saying that residents of the strip, who have intermittent access to the internet and haven’t had a regular supply of electricity since mid-October, are unlikely to see the messages in time. The Israeli military has also dropped leaflets on some areas of Gaza urging people to leave.

The resumed military offensive in Gaza is renewing fears of a deepened humanitarian crisis there. Israel cut off all supplies of electricity and deliveries of food and water through its crossing points with the isolated strip days after the Oct. 7 attack. The decision renders Palestinians in Gaza dependent on aid delivered through a single crossing point with Egypt.

Aid convoys from Egypt resumed Saturday after shutting down completely on Friday, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, which handles delivery of some aid on the Gaza side of the border.

“We feel like falling leaves. I don’t know if there’s a way to avoid destroying the south,” said Raghad, a 42-year-old schoolteacher who fled northern Gaza to the Khan Younis area during the cease-fire.

“Could we learn from the past? We need wisdom and maturity. Our life is precious, but we are in fear. It is now our constant companion,” she said.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
A Free-Speech Advocate Says That Colleges Are Doing It Wrong,2023-12-01T17:57:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Emily Bobrow'],"With the war in Gaza dividing college campuses across the country, Greg Lukianoff believes this difficult moment reveals the depth of the free-speech crisis in higher education. As president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit organization devoted to protecting speech, Lukianoff has observed up close the dissolution of campus discourse over the past decade. “It’s particularly ugly right now, but things have been bad for a long time,” he says.

Lukianoff’s nonpartisan group, known as FIRE, pledges to fight censorship from all directions. This means backing an economics professor at the University of Southern California who has been barred from campus for making anti-Hamas remarks to pro-Palestinian student protesters but also defending chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine against bans at various public universities.

Lukianoff, 49, says that the job of civil libertarians is not to agree with what everyone says but to defend the right to say it: “You have to be consistent.” Though FIRE works to protect speech that some deem offensive—for example, backing a public-college student who was suspended for shouting, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” at a pro-Israel gathering in October—Lukianoff says it does not support vandalism, violence, threats or speech that aims to incite imminent harm.

Campus unrest over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict comes at a time of heightened sensitivity generally, when calls to “cancel” professors and students for dissenting opinions have been rising at an alarming rate. As Lukianoff and co-author Rikki Schlott note in their new book, “The Canceling of the American Mind,” FIRE has documented over 1,000 attempts to get professors fired, punished or otherwise silenced for speech since 2014. Two-thirds of those efforts proved successful. The numbers far exceed estimates of the academic victims of McCarthyism in the 1940s and ‘50s, and Lukianoff argues that even unsuccessful censorship attempts chill speech. According to FIRE surveys in 2022, more than 80% of students have self-censored and over 90% of faculty said they are likely to self-censor their beliefs.

Instead of muffling troubling ideas, Lukianoff argues that we should be debating them—especially in places that are meant to encourage critical thinking and a spirit of free inquiry. “People who think the solution to a very real problem of antisemitism on campus is to clamp down on certain student groups don’t understand that this just makes it worse,” he says.

Curbs on speech inflame tensions, Lukianoff says, so he advises the opposite: “When people believe there’s a conspiracy to shut them up, do absolutely nothing that looks like a conspiracy to shut them up.” Suppression also reinforces pernicious ideologies by forcing these ideas underground. He points to France, where a “ferocious” brand of antisemitism is on the rise, despite longstanding bans on hate speech. “Telling people, ‘Don’t have bad beliefs’ never works,” he says.

Lukianoff suspects that his passion for the First Amendment has something to do with being a child of immigrants—his mother is from the U.K., his father from Yugoslavia. Growing up in the working-class city of Danbury, Conn., among families from Brazil, Korea, Peru, Vietnam and elsewhere, he says almost everyone he knew seemed to grasp the value of free speech to protect minority views.

It was only when he began meeting wealthier students, while studying international relations at American University in Washington, D.C., in the early 1990s, that he found people who praised Lenin and cultivated what he calls “an elite free-speech skepticism.” Although Lukianoff understands why many of his fellow students wanted limits on speech considered hateful, racist or sexist, he argues that policing language is not a route to social justice.

A campus visit from an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer helped inspire Lukianoff to specialize in First Amendment law at Stanford Law School. Yet when he interned at the ACLU of Northern California in 1999, he noticed a reduced interest in free-speech cases. He recalls praising the ACLU’s notorious support for the rights of neo-Nazis to march in 1977 in Skokie, Ill., and says he was told, “We don’t defend harassment here.” As a freshly minted lawyer in 2000, he was startled to discover that the First Amendment, once embraced wholeheartedly by the left, was increasingly seen as a tool of the right.

Nowhere is this clearer, says Lukianoff, than on college campuses. He and Schlott note in their book that in the 1980s, universities across the country began introducing codes of conduct aimed at curbing potentially hurtful speech. By the mid-2010s, students armed with social media had become empowered censors themselves, demanding “trigger warnings” and the policing of microaggressions while insisting that colleges disinvite speakers ranging from Condoleezza Rice to James Franco.

Ballooning campus bureaucracies merely reaffirmed student concerns that they needed protection from verbal “violence”—a phenomenon that Lukianoff and his co-author Jonathan Haidt described in an earlier book, “The Coddling of the American Mind.” Lukianoff now worries that the threat of cancellation is pervasive enough to encourage a kind of “groupthink,” particularly at elite colleges. “Viewpoint diversity has been on a rapid decline since the 1990s,” he says.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What policies should colleges enact around free speech? Join the conversation below.

Lukianoff, who lives in Washington with his wife and their two young sons, became FIRE’s first legal director in 2001 and president in 2006. Though he does not shy away from defending sometimes odious speech, he notes that every case has its critics—whether he is fighting Florida’s prohibition on teaching critical race theory in schools or suing California’s community college system for forcing professors to teach “diversity, equity and inclusion.” “The disapproval can wear on you,” he admits.

Being in the culture-war crossfire, he says, is partly why he needed to be hospitalized for depression in 2007. Part of his treatment involved cognitive behavioral therapy, which taught him to contextualize his thoughts in a way that made him feel more resilient. This insight helped him appreciate the insidiousness of “safetyism” on campuses—with its safe spaces and trigger warnings—which he argues makes students more anxious and depressed by accommodating their fears and reinforcing their faith in their own weaknesses. The “‘cure’ turns out to be a primary cause of the disease,” he and Haidt wrote in their 2015 book.

It might be disorienting to see students who embrace their own fragility also cheer on brutal acts of terrorism. But Lukianoff believes American universities now have an opportunity to correct their course after years of encouraging censorship and enforcing ideological conformity. He hopes that colleges seize the chance to steer students with conflicting opinions toward a more constructive dialogue and that university presidents who struggled to appease both donors and students with their recent political statements rethink the impulse to weigh in on politics at all. “Institutional neutrality is the bedrock of a free and open campus culture,” he argues.

More generally, Lukianoff argues that Americans would be better off “if we loosened elite higher education’s grip on society.” After “Coddling” came out, he says that heads of corporations and nonprofits called him to privately complain that young graduates from top schools were creating “serious problems” in the workplace by fixating on “minor interaction problems” with each other or with the institution itself. “My answer is, ‘Could you please tell the world that?’” says Lukianoff. “People need to know that the kind of product coming out of these elite schools is unworkable.”

In the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Russian warplanes pounded into rubble hospitals, schools and a theater packed with children.

The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have become intertwined in the global debate and in American politics. Contrasting reactions to them have widened the chasm between Western democracies and much of the rest of the planet, as mutual accusations of double standards inflame passions.

The two wars, to be sure, have major differences in their roots and dynamics. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was unprovoked, while Israel sent troops into Gaza because of a mass slaughter of Israeli civilians by the Islamist movement Hamas on Oct. 7.

But the two conflicts also have essential similarities. One is the staggering level of civilian suffering, with many tens of thousands of dead and injured in each region. Another is the shared predicament of millions of Ukrainians and Palestinians living under the indignities of military occupation.

Crucially, the polarization over who to blame for each war almost mirrors the global divide over the other war. Outrage and political mobilization have become subordinated to geopolitical allegiances—a selective empathy that often treats ordinary Ukrainians, Palestinians and Israelis as pawns in a larger ideological battle within Western societies and between the West and rivals such as China and Russia.

“The idea of humanity has yet to become fundamental to state policy and above all to our thinking,” lamented Oleksandra Matviichuk, a Ukrainian human-rights lawyer who was awarded last year’s Nobel Peace Prize. “When people discuss the war in the Middle East, the first question always is: Which side are you rooting for? But what we must root for is humanity… Each life is valuable, a life in Israel, a life in Palestine—and a life in Ukraine.”

With the body count in the Middle East rising, China, Russia and lesser autocracies like Iran increasingly exploit the tragedy to claim a moral high ground—posing a strategic challenge to the U.S. and its allies, who have framed their support for Ukraine in stark moral terms. It’s a problem acknowledged in Washington.

“We have a reputation in the global south that has been suffering. And now there is concern that the U.S. is calling out certain actions by Russia and saying these are unacceptable, these are not allowable, and yet has not been as effective in calling out similar actions in Gaza,” said Sen. Chris Coons, Democrat from Delaware and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I disagree with many of these characterizations, but what matters is that not just the heads of government, but the average people, believe them.”

The analogies between the two conflicts are fraught. When Russia unleashed the century’s first colonial war of conquest, few of the nations, intellectuals and political groups now protesting on behalf of the Palestinian cause were similarly outraged. Some of the most influential voices on social media, in fact, fiercely supported both Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who presided over a civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. Many parts of the developing world, and some on the American far left and far right, accepted Russia’s framing of the 2022 invasion as a move to pre-empt neocolonial encroachment by NATO—thus ignoring the aims and aspirations of Ukrainians themselves.

Iran has provided Moscow with lethal drones and artillery shells, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for standing on the side of international justice days after he annexed four Ukrainian regions last fall, and much of Africa, the Middle East and Asia abstained on U.N. resolutions criticizing the Russian invasion. Progressive luminaries of the American left, such as Noam Chomsky, applauded Putin for waging war in a more “humane” way than the Pentagon and urged Kyiv to capitulate on Russian terms.

Alicia Kearns, chair of the foreign-affairs committee of the British parliament, noted with frustration that few of her current interlocutors who seek condemnations of Israel were reaching out last year over Ukraine. “Let us recognize that we’re not happy with the way things are going, but the global south doesn’t get to now shout in support of Palestine when they were silent on Ukraine,” she said. “That is a double standard that nobody is calling out.”

Meanwhile, as parts of the Democratic Party’s base become more and more enraged by the bloodshed in Gaza, pressure is building in Congress to impose conditions on American military support for Israel. Ukraine and Gaza “are very difficult conflicts, no doubt, but the standards of morality and values must remain the same,” cautioned Rep. Jason Crow, Democrat from Colorado and himself a veteran of U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Though the Biden administration has consistently backed Israel’s military campaign and is rushing weapons to Israel, it has also used its leverage to successfully push for deliveries of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Washington has played a key role in negotiating a temporary cease-fire that, before collapsing Friday, allowed the exchange of dozens of hostages taken by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.

Some European nations, particularly Spain, Ireland and Belgium, have taken a much more critical stance on Israel’s bombing of Gaza. “The killing of civilians needs to stop now…The destruction of Gaza is unacceptable,” Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said during a recent visit with his Spanish counterpart to Egypt’s border with the Palestinian enclave.

Western military officials accept Israel’s insistence that, unlike Hamas, it isn’t deliberately targeting civilians. But they say that Israel’s targeting practices in Gaza, which have resulted in huge civilian casualties while minimizing Israel’s own military losses, are much looser than what the U.S. and allies had used in their campaign against Islamic State. In its war against Ukraine, which possesses modern air defenses, Russia employed devastating and unrestricted air power in only one battlefield, Mariupol, after isolating the Ukrainian port city in the first days of the war.

While the overlap between critics of Russia and critics of Israel is limited, some leaders in the developing world have been consistent—and don’t shy away from highlighting the contradictions now. One of them is Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, himself a former political prisoner who has repeatedly denounced Putin’s invasion. “We’ve been asked to condemn the aggression in Ukraine, but some remain muted in front of the atrocities inflicted on the Palestinians, particularly. It doesn’t concern their sense of justice and compassion,” he said at November’s gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders hosted by President Biden in San Francisco.

The surprise Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, in which some 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed and some 200 others kidnapped to Gaza, represented the biggest single loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust and sent shock waves through Western societies. In the aftermath of that massacre, U.S. and European leaders offered immediate and unconditional support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s military campaign against Hamas. It took weeks of massive bombing, which by then had caused thousands of Palestinian civilian deaths, for Western governments to qualify that backing with reminders to follow international humanitarian law. None of these reminders, however, came with public warnings of consequences should Israel ignore them.

The same Western leaders who described Russian targeting of Ukrainian power plants and water networks as a war crime endorsed, at least at first, the Israeli moves to deprive Gaza’s two million residents of electricity, drinking water and fuel. Few were more vocal in backing the Israeli war effort than Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who proclaimed that Israel and Ukraine were battling “the same evil,” citing Russia’s deepening alliance with Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas.

The White House has adopted a similar narrative, linking funding for Ukraine and for Israel in the defense appropriations bill that’s currently pending in Congress. “Both Putin and Hamas are fighting to wipe a neighboring democracy off the map,” Biden wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. “And both Putin and Hamas hope to collapse broader regional stability and integration and take advantage of the ensuing disorder.”

In part, such linkage serves the political purpose of getting the Republican-controlled House to pass military aid for Ukraine, administration officials say. While the Republican Party is strongly pro-Israel, support within it for Ukraine has been fraying in recent months, becoming a political issue ahead of next year’s elections. Leading Republican advocates for Ukraine argue that connecting aid to Israel and aid to Ukraine, as the White House has done, is logical. “We aren’t taking a double standard. We have taken the side of the people who were invaded,” said Sen. James Risch, Republican from Idaho and the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, blaming global criticism of Israel on antisemitic prejudice.

But while it’s true that Hamas seeks to murder or expel nearly all Israeli Jews, and Russia wants to wipe out the Ukrainian state and culture, such parallels are flawed. Ukraine, after all, is trying to regain the roughly 18% of its internationally recognized territory that remains under Russian rule. Israel, by contrast, has maintained military occupation over Palestinian territories since 1967, with Netanyahu pursuing the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and consistently undermining Israel’s only potential negotiating partner, the Palestinian Authority.

Though Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it has retained overall control of the enclave’s borders, waters and airspace, prompting the U.N. General Assembly and the International Committee of the Red Cross, among others, to continue considering the strip Israeli-occupied territory even as it was ruled by Hamas.

“It was honestly ridiculous that the Biden administration linked Ukraine and the war in Gaza in the opposite direction, ignoring the core connection, which is the occupation of territory—somethingthat has obviously been the principal source of comparison across the international community from the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, who has advised several U.S. administrations on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Zelensky’s unrestrained embrace of Israel, meanwhile, has damaged the Ukrainian cause in much of the global south, increasing the polarization, added Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. “Zelensky hitched his post to the Israelis and spoke so highly of the Israelis even when Israel itself refused for an extended period of time to forcefully support Ukraine and condemn Russia’s aggression,” Kaldas said. “That has created a lot of frustration. If you want to be arguing for a rules-based international order, if you want to be pushing back against countries taking territory with the use of force, then Ukraine shouldn’t be seeing itself as aligned with the Israelis.”

Amid the global competition for sympathy and attention, even the scale of the wars has become part of the ideological football, in part because of the strikingly different way in which the U.N. counts casualties. Arab diplomats and some international NGOs have used U.N. numbers, which the world body acknowledges represent only a fraction of the true toll for Ukraine, to argue that the tragedy in Gaza has eclipsed anything Russia has done to Ukraine and requires a fundamentally different response. South Africa, Turkey and several nations in South America withdrew ambassadors, suspended or severed diplomatic relations with Israel—a step that none of them took in Russia.

In Gaza, the U.N. has reported some 14,800 deaths, relaying information collected by the health ministry of the Hamas-controlled enclave, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. In Ukraine, the U.N. reported only the 10,000 civilian deaths that it has been able to verify, noting that the true figure is much higher because it has no access to Russian-occupied cities like Mariupol and front-line areas where the worst carnage has occurred. Ukrainian officials estimate that in Mariupol alone at least 25,000 civilians, and perhaps twice as many, were killed during the monthslong Russian siege last year. Some 9.5 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, and tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.

Of course, just as the conflict in Ukraine didn’t start in February 2022, the conflict in the Middle East didn’t begin with the Hamas invasion of Oct. 7. Russia, which controlled Ukraine for centuries and views ancient Kyiv as the cradle of its own nationhood, first invaded in 2014, occupying Crimea and parts of eastern Donbas region and triggering a war that killed 14,000 people at the time, according to U.N. calculations, and displaced millions.

The history of Israeli-Palestinian violence is even more tortured and dates back to the Zionist settlement movement of the 19th century. More than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from what is now Israel as the Jewish state was established in 1948, with most of Gaza’s population made up of descendants of these refugees. Multiple opportunities for peace in recent decades were frustrated by Hamas, which organized suicide bombing campaigns, and by the Israeli far right, one of whose members assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. While the Hamas attack of Oct. 7 was by far the bloodiest in the history of the conflict, thousands of Palestinian and Israeli civilians have died in regular flare-ups in past decades. Neither Hamas nor the current Israeli government supports a two-state solution.

The main difference between the two wars is that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with all its complexities, lacks the moral clarity of the Ukrainian resistance to Russia, said British lawmaker Alex Sobel, a Labour co-chair of the U.K. parliament’s all-party group on Ukraine.

“There is no moral justification for the Russian invasion. Zero. It’s just about Russian imperialism,” he said. “But in Israel and Palestine, it’s about the fact that there are two peoples on a very small amount of land, and political and military elites on both sides are unwilling to settle for what’s on offer. It’s not black and white at all.”

Israel Plans to Kill Hamas Leaders Around the World After War,2023-12-01T04:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Dion Nissenbaum'],"TEL AVIV—Israel’s intelligence services are preparing to kill Hamas leaders around the world when the nation’s war in the Gaza Strip winds down, setting the stage for a yearslong campaign to hunt down militants responsible for the Oct. 7 massacres, Israeli officials said.

With orders from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel’s top spy agencies are working on plans to hunt down Hamas leaders living in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar, the small Gulf nation that has allowed the group to run a political office in Doha for a decade, the officials said.

The assassination campaign would be an extension of Israel’s decadeslong clandestine operations that have become the subject of both Hollywood legend and worldwide condemnation. Israeli assassins have hunted Palestinian militants in Beirut while dressed as women, and killed a Hamas leader in Dubai while disguised as tourists. Israel has used a car bomb to assassinate a Hezbollah leader in Syria and a remote-controlled rifle to kill a nuclear scientist in Iran, according to former Israeli officials.

For years, countries such as Qatar, Lebanon, Iran, Russia and Turkey have provided Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, with a measure of protection. And Israel has at times refrained from targeting the Palestinian militants to avoid creating diplomatic crises.

The new plans would mark a second chance for Netanyahu, who ordered a botched 1997 attempt to poison Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal in Jordan. The well-documented attempt instead led to the release of Hamas’s spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.

To the consternation of some Israeli officials who want the latest plans to remain a mystery, Netanyahu telegraphed his intentions in a nationwide address on Nov. 22.

“I have instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas wherever they are,” he said, referring to Israel’s foreign-intelligence service.

In the same address, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas leaders are living on “borrowed time.”

“They are marked for death,” he said. “The struggle is worldwide, both the terrorists in Gaza and those who fly in expensive planes.”

While Israel typically tries to keep such efforts secret, the nation’s leaders have shown few reservations about revealing their intentions to hunt down everyone responsible for the Oct. 7 attack, just like they did to those responsible for the Palestinian terrorist attack that killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches at the Munich Olympics in 1972.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Can Hamas survive as an organization following the war with Israel? Join the conversation below.

Israel is already working to kill or capture Hamas leaders inside Gaza, the officials said. The question now for Israeli leaders isn’t about whether to try to kill Hamas leaders elsewhere in the world, but where—and how, the officials said.

The evolving plans are an extension of Israel’s war in Gaza and a reflection of its intentions to ensure that Hamas can never again pose a serious threat to Israel—just as the U.S. led a global coalition against Islamic State militants who set up a self-proclaimed caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria. As part of the effort, Israel is also looking at whether it could forcibly expel thousands of low-level Hamas fighters from Gaza as a way to shorten the war.

Targeted killings abroad can violate international law and run the risk of blowback from nations in which assassins operate without their permission. In practice, however, Israel and others have pursued targeted killings and weathered the repercussions.

Israel’s plans to target Hamas leaders began to take shape shortly after Oct. 7, when Hamas militants carried out a brazen cross-border attack that Israel said killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians. More than 200 others, including American and Europeans holding dual Israeli citizenship, were abducted and taken back to Gaza.

Some Israeli officials wanted to launch an immediate campaign to kill Meshaal and other Hamas leaders living abroad, the officials said. The officials were especially incensed by a video of Meshaal, and other Hamas leaders, including its top political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, celebrating and praying at one of their offices while watching live news coverage of the Oct. 7 attacks.

Israel isn’t known to have carried out any targeted-killing operations in Qatar, and doing so after Oct. 7 could have torpedoed continuing efforts to negotiate the release of those held hostage, the officials said. Those concerns helped temper efforts to immediately embark on the assassination campaign, but the planning continues, they said.

Qatar has become the central hub for the hostage talks, with the head of the Mossad, David Barnea, meeting CIA chief William Burns in Doha earlier this week for more discussions. Doha has helped to secure the release of dozens of Israeli hostages held by Gaza militants in return for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. More than 130 hostages remain in Gaza, according to Israel’s account.

Netanyahu’s vow to hunt down Hamas leaders around the world has sparked a debate among former intelligence officials.

Efraim Halevy, a former Mossad director, called it ill-advised. Killing Hamas leaders won’t eliminate the threat, he said. It has the potential to instead inflame the group’s followers and accelerate creation of even worse threats.

“Pursuing Hamas on a worldwide scale and trying to systematically remove all its leaders from this world is a desire to exact revenge, not a desire to achieve a strategic aim,” said Halevy, who called the plan “far-fetched.”

Amos Yadlin, a retired Israeli general who once led the military’s intelligence agency, said the campaign “is what justice demands.”

“All the Hamas leaders, all those who participated in the attack, who planned the attack, who ordered the attack, should be brought to justice or eliminated,” Yadlin said. “It’s the right policy.”

Perhaps no other nation has Israel’s experience in carrying out worldwide assassination campaigns. Since World War II, Israel has conducted more than 2,700 such operations, according to the book “Rise and Kill First,” by Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman.

Even before Israel was founded in 1948, Jewish militants killed European diplomats who were involved in the British administration of Mandatory Palestine. In the 1960s, Israeli spies used letter bombs to target former Nazi Germany scientists helping Egypt develop rockets.

The campaigns have sometimes backfired.

In 1997, Netanyahu, then serving his first term as prime minister, ordered Israeli spies to kill Meshaal, a Hamas founder who was then living in Jordan. The Israeli team entered Jordan posing as Canadian tourists and attacked Meshaal outside the Hamas political office in Amman. One Israeli assassin sprayed a toxin into Meshaal’s ear but he was captured along with another member of the team before they could escape.

Meshaal fell into a coma, and Jordan threatened to terminate its peace treaty with Israel. Then-President Bill Clinton pressed Netanyahu to end the crisis by sending his Mossad chief to Amman with the antidote that saved Meshaal’s life. Israel then secured the freedom of its operatives in Jordan by agreeing to release Yassin, the Hamas spiritual leader, and 70 other Palestinian prisoners.

Meshaal later described the failed assassination attempt as a “turning point” that helped empower Hamas.

Israel continued its assassination campaign against Hamas for years.

In 2010, a team of Israeli operatives using forged European passports flew to Dubai, where they masqueraded as tourists while awaiting the arrival of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founder of the Hamas military wing who led the group’s efforts to buy weapons.

Surveillance video later captured members of the team, dressed as tennis players, following Mabhouh to his room, where the Israelis paralyzed and then suffocated the Hamas leader. While it initially appeared that Mabhouh had died of natural causes, Dubai officials eventually identified the hit team and accused Israel of the assassination.

It took years to repair the damage to Israel’s relations with the United Arab Emirates.

It was the deadly Palestinian militant attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics that cemented the nation’s embrace of covert assassinations as a tool of government policy.

Palestinian gunmen with a group known as Black September took a group of Israeli athletes and coaches hostage in the Olympic Village, leading to a two-day standoff that ended with a failed rescue attempt by West German police. All 11 Israeli hostages were killed.

In response, then-Prime Minister Golda Meir ordered Israeli spies to hunt down and kill all Palestinian militants involved in the attack. The covert campaign was dubbed Operation Wrath of God and became the subject of an Oscar-nominated 2005 Steven Spielberg movie.

Israeli assassins spent 20 years hunting those linked to the Munich attack. They killed Palestinians in France, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Lebanon. They used a remote-controlled bomb hidden inside a phone in France and used guns with silencers to kill targets in the streets of Rome.

Among those to take part in the yearslong effort was Ehud Barak, then a young Israeli commando who went on to become prime minister. In 1973, Barak, dressed as a woman, was part of a team that sneaked into Beirut to kill three Palestinian militants linked to the Munich attack. They killed all three in a matter of minutes.

But Operation Wrath of God also led to one of Israel’s most embarrassing covert failures in 1973, when a team of Israeli operatives killed a Moroccan waiter in Norway who they had mistakenly identified as a Palestinian militant involved in the Munich attack. Six of the 15 Israeli operatives were arrested and five were sentenced to short prison terms for their roles in the killing.

College students haven’t always been persuaded by Osama bin Laden ’s prose. Yet when his 2002 “Letter to America” went viral among young Americans earlier this month, I wasn’t surprised. I had assigned the document for a course on religion and politics when it first appeared. Students found it compelling as a clear and concise statement of al Qaeda’s motives, intentions and understanding of world and Middle Eastern history. They were horrified, as were most faculty.

Yet a year earlier, only a few days after Sept. 11, 2001, a cultural Marxist professor lectured a staff meeting on the need to understand and sympathize with the 19 unfortunate men who had been driven to their martyrdom by Western colonial oppression. Those in the towers, he intoned, had it coming. On that day, my colleagues reacted to this claim with derision and contempt. But the virus had arrived. It would soon spread."
Israel Considers How to Remove Threat of Hamas Fighters in Gaza,2023-11-30T04:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Dion Nissenbaum'],"TEL AVIV—As Israeli forces prepare for a renewed offensive targeting Hamas’s top leaders in the Gaza Strip, Israeli military and political leaders are confronting the challenge of what to do about the thousands of fighters that represent the group’s power base.

To address that challenge, some Israeli and U.S. officials are discussing the idea of expelling thousands of lower-level militants from the Palestinian enclave as a way to shorten the war. The idea is reminiscent of the U.S.-brokered deal that allowed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and thousands of fighters to flee Beirut during Israel’s 1982 siege of the Lebanese capital.

The prospect of expelling Hamas fighters is part of evolving Israeli and American talks about who will run Gaza when the war ends and what can be done to ensure that the territory can never be used to stage another attack on Israel like the one on Oct. 7, the worst in the nation’s history.

One proposal for how to govern a post-Hamas Gaza, developed by the Israeli military’s think tank and viewed by The Wall Street Journal, would start with the creation of what it calls “Hamas-free safe zones” that would be ruled by a new Gaza authority backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Separate U.S.-Israeli discussions about moving Hamas fighters and their families out of the Gaza Strip aim to provide some Hamas fighters with an exit strategy and make it easier to rebuild Gaza once the fighting ends.

As a temporary cease-fire that began Friday continues to hold, there is still no emerging consensus on the fundamental questions that could bring the war to an end. There is no agreement between Israel, the U.S. and Arab nations about who should run Gaza or who would provide daily security for the two million people living there.

Israel and the U.S. are at odds over what role, if any, the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority should play in running Gaza. And there is no road map for what should happen to thousands of Hamas fighters and their families.

One option being discussed by Israel and the U.S. is the proposal to force lower-level fighters to leave the Gaza Strip, to prevent the group—which the U.S. considers to be a terrorist organization—from regaining power.

Before the war started, Israel estimated that Hamas had about 30,000 fighters in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vowed to kill the top Hamas leaders and any members who took part in the Oct. 7 attacks.

The Israeli military estimates that it has killed thousands of militants since the war began. Determining how to address the large number of surviving Hamas fighters and their families has led officials to consider the Beirut model.

In 1982, Israeli military forces encircled Beirut in an effort to weaken the Palestine Liberation Organization’s power in Lebanon. The two-month siege and extensive Israeli bombing of Beirut created a rift between Israel and the U.S., which brokered a deal to end the fight with an agreement by Israel to allow Arafat and about 11,000 Palestinian fighters to leave Lebanon for Tunisia.

There has been no recent discussion of allowing top Hamas officials such as Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar and military commander Mohammed Deif to leave Gaza because of their role in planning the Oct. 7 attacks, which Israel says killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians.

Leaving Gaza would be fundamentally different for Palestinian fighters today than leaving Lebanon was in 1982. While the militants were visitors in Beirut, the Gaza Strip is home and part of a hoped-for independent Palestinian state.

One senior Israeli official said it isn’t clear that Hamas fighters would take the option of exile, if offered.

“I don’t see them as rational as the PLO was,” the official said. “It’s a more religious, jihadistic organization connected to the ideas of Iran.”

The official said there was no “practical discussion” of exiling Hamas fighters but said that if Israel left Hamas with no other choice, the option might become possible. Hamas officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Some Hamas fighters might be willing to consider the idea if their leadership is killed, said Randa Slim, director of the Conflict Resolution and Track II Dialogues Program at the Middle East Institute. But the idea faces many hurdles that could make it impractical, she said.

The proposal would require support from countries willing to accept the Hamas fighters, whose leaders have found safety in places such as Turkey, Qatar, Iran, Russia and Lebanon. It would have to address the question of whether the fighters would be able to leave with their families. And it would require Hamas to trust Israel to honor whatever commitments it makes in the deal, such as an agreement not to target the militants once they leave Gaza.

“I think it is unrealistic today given the current state of conflict,” Slim said. “But things might evolve in the future.”

The military, meanwhile, has developed the separate proposal that envisions the creation of a “Gaza Restoration Authority,” backed by Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., that would be charged with rebuilding a Hamas-free Gaza Strip.

That proposal is mostly a starting point for discussions that face huge obstacles, including the U.S. position, opposed by Israel, that any postwar government in Gaza should be linked to the Palestinian Authority. It would also require buy-in from Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. The Israeli military declined to comment on its proposal.

Hamas Seizes the Advantage,2023-11-29T23:10:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Daniel Henninger'],"As predicted, events since the Hamas massacre of Oct. 7 have unfolded in a way that puts Israel, the victim of the mass slaughter, at a significant political disadvantage.

News reports say Egypt and Qatar, the two nations involved in hostage-release negotiations, are pushing for a long-term cease-fire. The Biden administration, we may assume, will support this goal.

In short, Hamas’s planners and fighters look likely to survive without personal accountability for the 1,200 killed on Oct. 7. Instead, the burden will fall on Israel to assent to talks with Hamas, whose goal remains removing the rest of Israel’s more than nine million people.

Credit is due Hamas—and its partner Palestinian Islamic Jihad—for figuring out the utility of modern sensibilities, especially in the U.S. Initially the world was shocked that Hamas kidnapped young children and pregnant or elderly women. This week’s dramatic release of 4-year-old American Abigail Idan is exemplary. Hamas murdered her parents, then took the child to Gaza.

Hamas understood that the unprecedented horror of its Oct. 7 attack would melt away amid daily media attention to the unbearable horror of these vulnerable hostages and the realities of war inside Gaza. Responding to the second horror has forced Israel’s army to stand down, possibly putting other Israelis at mortal peril from attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah.

Professional terrorism has come a long way. One of the earliest acts of Palestinian terror, by a Hamas precursor called Black September, was the kidnapping of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, televised to the world. It ended with the deaths of athletes and terrorists. In 1985, Hezbollah and Abu Nidal terrorists hijacked two separate airliners and attacked airports in Rome and Vienna.

Ultimately the world took precautions, internalized these terrorist attacks, and in some sense learned to live with them. The post-9/11 airport-security lines have become an accepted annoyance. But by kidnapping babies, children and grandmothers, terrorism had finally hit on a tactic the world could not absorb.

For the record, the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 schoolgirls in 2014, which led for awhile to the global social-media campaign #BringBackOurGirls. It accomplished little. Some 100 girls remain missing, and those terrorists, now affiliated with Islamic State, continue their assaults.

No one can be unmoved by the reunions of the Israeli hostages with their families. But it is impossible not to miss a second dilemma. Israel said Tuesday its goal remains to dismantle Hamas. But how, when the current standoff gives Hamas an incentive to hold some hostages indefinitely?

Meanwhile, running alongside are anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian demonstrations like those in New York City the past week. Protesters glued themselves to Sixth Avenue, blocking the

Thanksgiving Day Parade. Hours later, they vandalized the facade of the New York Public Library’s main building, doing an estimated $75,000 of damage.

On Saturday, they moved on the Museum of Natural History—closed in anticipation—demanding to be let inside to see exhibits of the “colonizers,” burning an Israeli flag and shouting that the police officers protecting the museum were equal to the “KKK.”

As we went to press, these activist groups planned to wreck the Wednesday evening lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. A social-media post said, “Bring your flags, signs & keffiyehs, mobilization, not celebration!” Apparently baby Jesus is also complicit.

Add the campus demonstrations, and this constitutes Joe Biden’s Democratic youth base, which is pushing the president and his party toward equivocal support for the state of Israel.

The intensity of these demonstrations calls to mind the early 1970s, when some members of the left-wing group Students for a Democratic Society tipped over to become a domestic terror group called the Weather Underground. They blew themselves up while making bombs in a Greenwich Village townhouse.

In the U.S., we have arrived at a familiar crossroads. Amid a growing atmosphere of civil disorder, much of it organized, we can either stand back and live with it or push back, deciding that the potential price to our own security eventually could be too high.

New York again illustrates the challenge. The police detained some of the rampaging pro-Palestine protesters, but there’s little prospect of Manhattan’s progressive District Attorney Alvin Bragg prosecuting them. After the city’s George Floyd protests (including store lootings), which ran almost daily for weeks, state Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit—against the New York City Police Department for mishandling activists.

Right now cops and demonstrators, not to mention store-smashing thieves, know the previous structure for maintaining order is dormant.

A word returning to fashion in national-security circles is “deterrence.” Deterrence is a bow to the dangers of accommodating disorder. The Netanyahu government’s accommodation of Hamas in Gaza was a deterrence failure. Communist China’s military expansiveness is a deterrence failure, as are the attacks by Iran’s proxies on U.S. forces and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Virulent antisemitism on U.S. campuses is a deterrence failure. The border is a deterrence failure. So is urban crime. It adds up.

As an entry point for discussion on how to avoid calamity, a simple proposal: Start doing the opposite. Relearn deterrence.

Notable & Quotable: Schumer on Antisemitism,2023-11-29T21:34:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"Majority Leader Chuck Schumer speaking on the Senate floor Nov. 29:

Jewish Americans were alarmed to see some of our fellow citizens characterize a brutal terrorist attack as justified because of the actions of the Israeli government. . . .

Even worse, in some cases, people even celebrated what happened, describing it as the deserved fate of quote “colonizers” and calling for quote “glory to the martyrs” who carried out these heinous attacks.

Many of the people who have expressed these sentiments in America aren’t neo-Nazis, or card-carrying Klan members, or Islamist extremists. They are in many cases people that most liberal Jewish Americans felt previously were their ideological fellow travelers.

Not long ago, many of us marched together for black and brown lives, we stood against anti-Asian hatred, we protested bigotry against the LGBTQ community, we fought for reproductive justice out of the recognition that injustice against one oppressed group is injustice against all.

But apparently, in the eyes of some, that principle does not extend to the Jewish people."

By Ismail Kadare, translated by John Hodgson | Counterpoint

In 1934, Joseph Stalin phoned Boris Pasternak to ask for his thoughts about the arrest of the poet Osip Mandelstam. From that brief interaction, Ismail Kadare fashions a work of philosophical profundity. The celebrated Albanian novelist offers an unsparing appraisal of every facet of the impossibly fraught “mutual dependency” between art and the state, drawing from his own decades of writing under a dictatorship.

In the social-media age, young people face a barrage of messages that foster eating disorders such as anorexia. But those are only part of the problem. Hadley Freeman, who as a teen nearly starved herself to death, notes that suffering teens are often “good kids” with perfectionist streaks. But she also explores biological factors like hormones and neurotransmitters. The primary cause she finds for her own struggle—an intense desire to avoid the complexity of adolescence—has lessons for today. Review by Sally Satel

Feds Launch Investigation of Harvard for Possible Civil-Rights Violations,2023-11-29T17:14:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Douglas Belkin'],"Protesters demonstrated over the war in the Gaza Strip at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., this month.

The U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights on Tuesday added Harvard University to the list of schools the agency is investigating as part of a federal crackdown on race- and religious-based harassment since the start of the conflict in Gaza began last month.

Harvard is the 15th school and 8th college or university added to the list since the conflict began Oct. 7, according to the agency’s website. Other colleges include The University of Pennsylvania, Wellesley College and Columbia University. The number of schools under investigation this year doubled since the conflict started.

An institution named on this list means that OCR has initiated an investigation of a case concerning that institution. It doesn’t mean that OCR has made a decision about the case.

“Hate has no place in our schools, period. When students are targeted because they are—or are perceived to be—Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Sikh, or any other ethnicity or shared ancestry, schools must act to ensure safe and inclusive educational environments where everyone is free to learn,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said earlier this month. “These investigations underscore how seriously the Biden-Harris Administration, including the U.S. Department of Education, takes our responsibility to protect students from hatred and discrimination.”

A Harvard spokesman said the school supports “the work of the Office of Civil Rights to ensure students’ rights to access educational programs are safeguarded and will work with the office to address their questions.”

On Oct 7. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, attacked Israeli civilians, killing more than 1,200 people. The next day, the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee and more than 30 other student groups signed a statement that said Israel’s “apartheid regime is the only one to blame” for the violence.

Around the same time, Harvard President Claudine Gay issued a memo saying she was “heartbroken by the death and destruction” caused by the surprise Hamas attack on Saturday and Israel’s retaliation against Gaza.

Shortly thereafter, former Harvard President Larry Summers criticized Gay for failing to condemn Hamas.

Gay amended her statements about the attacks amid growing pressure. Around that time, pro-Palestinian protesters accosted a Jewish Harvard Business School student in an incident that was filmed and put on online. The school condemned the incident.

Leaders of Harvard, MIT and University of Pennsylvania will next week address Congress at a hearing titled “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism.”

“Over the past several weeks, we’ve seen countless examples of antisemitic demonstrations on college campuses. Meanwhile, college administrators have largely stood by, allowing horrific rhetoric to fester and grow,” U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina said.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
"First Ukraine, Now Gaza: Wars Put Fresh Strain on NATO",2023-11-29T13:04:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Vivian Salama', 'Daniel Michaels']","BRUSSELS—NATO members are grappling with the complexities of multiple simultaneous crises in the Middle East and Ukraine.

After a temporary cease-fire was extended this week in Gaza, members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization sought to reaffirm their commitment to eastern Mediterranean countries closest to the conflict amid concerns it could spread across the region.

The new threat drew the attention of NATO foreign ministers gathered for a scheduled meeting of the military alliance dominated by the slow and grueling conflict in Ukraine. Among emerging concerns are the safety of NATO forces in Iraq, turmoil in NATO’s Middle East partners including Jordan and renewed tensions in the former Yugoslavia.

A panel of NATO experts is already looking at strategies for bolstering the security of its southernmost members, which a senior U.S. official said goes beyond the current conflict. European officials at NATO said the bloc was increasingly concerned about vulnerabilities due to instability in the Middle East and Europe’s ability to counter those threats given the strain created by its commitments to the war in Ukraine, and long-running efforts to tackle illegal immigration from the south.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Brussels for the meetings at NATO and with ministers from Ukraine and the Group of Seven alliance, will also attend a meeting Wednesday of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Skopje, North Macedonia. He will then quickly depart to the Middle East for meetings in Israel and the West Bank.

Blinken and other senior U.S. officials have had an almost constant presence in the region since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostages. The attack prompted Israel’s massive military response, which is currently paused but likely to resume.

“We certainly had conversations about Gaza, but it in no way took away from the intense focus that we’ve had over the last couple of days on Ukraine as well as Western Balkans and preparing for the NATO summit in Washington next spring,” Blinken told reporters before departing Brussels.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, speaking during the assembly of 31 foreign ministers and candidate-member Sweden, restated NATO policy that the Middle East is outside the alliance’s area of responsibility and it has no intention of getting involved in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

But the individual delegations stressed that NATO as an organization shouldn’t be blind to the potential security implications of the conflict in Gaza, and some countries voiced frustration with the U.S. and U.K. for supporting Israel’s bombardment of Gaza at the expense of heavily populated civilian neighborhoods.

“Ministers expressed concern about the war in the Middle East,” Stoltenberg said, without providing any details. “NATO as an alliance doesn’t play an active role in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Some allies are active in different ways.”

While grappling with the two wars drawing global attention, alliance members also tackled new flare-ups in a decadeslong conflict between Serbia and Kosovo, where NATO has played a peacekeeping role since 1999. NATO’s Kosovo Force has roughly 5,000 troops, where fighting has repeatedly flared since the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.

“One thing we don’t need is a return to the future,” Blinken said at NATO, noting the alliance’s interest in avoiding future conflicts in the Balkans.

NATO’s mission in Iraq, launched in 2018, includes several hundred military personnel and civilian advisers training Iraqi forces, the safety of whom is causing growing concern among various NATO missions, who point to the uptick in recent attacks against U.S. military bases in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. has significantly downsized its diplomatic footprint in Iraq since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in Israel over concern that Washington’s support for Israel would make it a target for other militant groups seeking to capitalize on growing instability.

Jordan has also joined with NATO on regional security since 1995 and King Abdullah visited the headquarters of the alliance and met with Stoltenberg earlier this month.

Turkey is the only NATO member that directly borders the Middle East region, but the U.S., U.K. and other nations have deployed military assets to the eastern Mediterranean, near NATO’s southern flank, seeking to deter other groups—particularly Lebanon-based Hezbollah—that may try to join the fight.

At NATO’s annual summit, in Lithuania in July, leaders considered a proposal, put forward by Portugal, to address “the threats and opportunities for partnership” on the southern flank, in particular with the Middle East, the Sahel and North Africa—showing that “they do not ignore the need to develop other partnerships and establish other opportunities for cooperation.”

“Part of the instability we see in our southern neighbors is linked to the conflict we see in the Middle East,” Stoltenberg said Tuesday.

But as a guarantor of security in Europe, NATO has in recent years taken responsibility for risks to the continent—such as uncontrolled migration and terrorism—from regions to its south, including the Middle East and Africa.

Following the Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2010 and the ensuing civil war in Syria, several million people left the region and joined the migrant flows from Africa and Afghanistan. In 2015, more than one million of them overwhelmed Europe’s border protections, sparking a migrant crisis.

Stoltenberg didn’t hesitate to warn about the potential consequences of the fighting.

“One of the messages from NATO is that it’s important that this conflict does not escalate to a bigger regional conflict,” Stoltenberg said. “The message to Iran is…they have to rein in their proxies.” Hamas and Hezbollah are supported by Tehran.

NATO’s efforts parallel those of other organizations, which include many members of the organization. The 27-country European Union, which includes 22 NATO members and Sweden, has taken a more active role in the Middle East crisis, as has the G-7.

On the sidelines of the NATO ministerial, G-7 foreign ministers voiced collective support for creating a Palestinian state as part of a two-state solution, and welcomed the release of hostages by Hamas to allow for a pause in hostilities and delivery of some humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.

The group stressed the need to ensure humanitarian support for civilians, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies continued and voiced collective support for an extended pause in fighting.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba Tuesday, said the bloc could handle both crises.

The Gaza war “has been high in the international agenda, but I wanted to assure Minister Kuleba that it is not distracting us from our firm and unequivocal support to Ukraine,” Borrell said.

The War in Ukraine News and insights, selected by the editors"
Gaza Protests at Colleges Open a Generational Divide,2023-11-28T13:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Douglas Belkin', 'Melissa Korn']","Three years ago, Erin Mullen arrived at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst exhausted by the pandemic and without any appetite for political demonstrations. Last month she sat in a holding cell in an Amherst jail with her hands cuffed behind her back, one of 57 students arrested while protesting the conflict in Gaza.

Mullen is white, her parents were raised Catholic and she grew up in an upper middle class Boston suburb. Her political awakening—along with those of tens of thousands of her generation now enrolled at college—is fueling a surge of campus unrest not seen since the Vietnam War.

A wave of pro-Palestinian protests has swept college campuses, leading to heightened tensions, counterprotests and, in some cases, violence. The conflict has also exposed a generational divide, with many older Americans surprised at the protests’ scope and intensity.

Mullen and other pro-Palestinian college demonstrators say their activism is rooted in a deeply held conviction that the world is divided between the oppressed and their oppressors.

That view frames the suffering of an array of populations, they say, including low-income families being evicted from their homes, Black and brown people who encounter brutal treatment by the police, migrants turned away from safe haven at the border and, in the current conflict, Palestinians struggling to wrest control of territory from the Israelis.

“Gaza is not a two-sided war,” said Mullen, who is 21. “What is happening is the resistance of the oppressed against their oppressor.”

The protesters’ sympathy for Hamas, designated by the U.S. as a terrorist group, sometimes astonishes and rankles bystanders. Roughly half of Americans 18 to 24 years old think Hamas’s October attack was justified by grievances of the Palestinians, according to a Harvard Harris Poll. Just 9% of people aged 65 and older feel the same.

The activists at pro-Palestinian events include a range of student groups who say they can draw a direct line from the causes they support to the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.

In one protest earlier this month, University of Pennsylvania Students Against the Occupation were joined by groups including Fossil Free Penn, Police Free Penn, Save UC Townhomes and Students for the Preservation of Chinatown at a demonstration outside a board of trustees meeting.

Participants seamlessly shifted between calls for a cease-fire in Gaza and concerns about fair wages for graduate students, the police presence on Penn’s campus, the university’s endowment choices and opposition to the construction of a new 76ers basketball arena in center-city Philadelphia.

“Occupation is a crime, from West Philly to Palestine!” the group of about 50 students and others shouted.

“All oppressed and displaced people are fighting for their right to return,” declared one speaker, who, like most people in the audience, wore a mask covering his face. “From 40th and Market to Palestine, this is the same struggle.”

Last month, Brown University’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter issued a statement that said the group held “the Israeli regime and its allies unequivocally responsible for all suffering and loss of life, Palestinian or Israeli.” It was endorsed by more than 40 other student groups, including the Teaching Assistant Labor Organization, Burlesque at Brown, Brown Beekeeping Society and Poler Bears, a pole-dancing performance group.

Generational shifts

Today’s college students entered elementary school as fire drills gave way to active-shooter drills and their parents navigated the 2008 recession. They came of age as the climate crisis gained attention and the 2016 election of Donald Trump polarized their communities.

Their schools closed during the pandemic, then streets shut down for protests following the murder of George Floyd. Now they are struggling with high rates of anxiety and depression as they prepare to enter an economy in which income inequality is near all-time highs.

Nearly half of 18- to 29-year-olds favor socialism—more than those who support a market economy, which many blame for the compounding disasters they face, according to a 2022 poll from Pew Research.

Noah Thompson, a 24-year-old senior at the University of Oregon, works in a university dining hall to put himself through school. Raised by a single mother, he believes too much of the nation’s wealth has accrued to the most affluent, and capitalism is skewed to help the rich and exploit the poor. He said he’s troubled by war profiteers selling arms to Israel, who then use the weapons to kill children, and has helped organize a “No Money for Massacres” campaign to promote a cease-fire in Palestine.

“There always seems to be enough money, bombs, for war, for intervention abroad, and never enough money for education, for healthcare, for creating a better and secure society for us here now,” he said.

Some student protesters have minimized the brutality of the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, when militants killed more than 1,200 Israeli civilians, including concertgoers and children, and took 240 hostages. Health authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza say more than 13,000 people had been killed there in the war.

Some protesters have referred to the attack in demonstrations and public statements as an “armed uprising” or “act of resistance.” That framing has been particularly abhorrent to Jewish leaders, who have called on campus administrators to denounce such language as antisemitic.

Many who support the Palestinian cause on campuses say they’re uncomfortable speaking publicly for fear of being harassed or called antisemitic. Trucks have circled some campuses, including at Harvard and Columbia, identifying the names and faces of students accused of blaming Israel for the Hamas attack. Ads for many rallies encourage attendees to wear masks to protect their anonymity, not take pictures and avoid reporters.

College presidents are struggling to navigate between championing free speech, mollifying outraged alumni and protecting Jewish and Arab students from harassment. Universities in recent weeks have announced advisory committees, task forces and research centers to address rising antisemitism.

At Columbia University, a male student was hit with a wooden stick after he confronted a female student who was ripping down posters advertising a rally supporting Israel. At both Tulane University and the University of Massachusetts, Palestinian supporters punched Jewish students during protests. At Cornell University, a student was charged with threatening to shoot up a kosher dining hall. Students at schools across the country have torn down or scribbled over posters of Israelis who are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.

‘Never capitulate’

One theme prominent at protests across the country is the opposition to “settler colonialism,” or violent empire building that displaces an indigenous community. Zionism—support for Israel as a Jewish state—is viewed by many college protesters as the modern equivalent to European colonization of the Americas and Africa.

“We will never capitulate to the colonizer or his sympathizers,” the George Washington University Students for Justice in Palestine said on their Instagram account. “The settler colony will fall, our land will be liberated, and we will return to our homes again.”

Classes on the history and experiences of previously marginalized communities have become more prevalent on campuses in disciplines like African-American studies, women’s and gender studies and Middle Eastern studies. Universities began focusing on courses that reached beyond the Western canon about 50 years ago, in response to a more racially diverse student body, said Rachel Fish, a special adviser to the Brandeis University’s presidential initiative to counter antisemitism in higher education.

“It seems so obvious when you’re watching it from halfway across the world that there’s this genocide going on,” said Price Little, a 21-year-old senior at the University of San Francisco, who grew up in rural Mariposa, Calif. He wrote a column for the local paper about his take on Black Lives Matter and world affairs, but had little direct exposure to any conflicts himself.

College brought new encounters with students from a range of backgrounds, which Little said was eye-opening. With a double major of French studies and fine arts, he signed up for classes about areas colonized by the French empire, Islamic art and theology. He became best friends with a Pakistani American student and joined a South Asian student group, and more recently the Arab Student Union and Muslim Student Association.

Last month he stayed on after a club event, as some of the students began discussing plans for a rally.

“I sat in for a few hours on that, just in the corner, listening,” Little recalled. He knew that Hamas had attacked and Israel was striking back with bombs, but said being in that room was a galvanizing moment. “This was not something where I knew the brutal extent of all of it. That’s when it became more of an active mission for me,” he said.

A few weeks ago, Little joined in a pro-Palestinian rally, his sign reading, “Queer Muslims for Palestine.”

Little, who identifies as queer and isn’t Muslim, said he doesn’t condone Hamas’s treatment of queer people. Same-sex relations are outlawed in Gaza and punishable by up to 10 years in prison, according to Human Rights Watch.

“It’s not ideal,” he said of supporting a resistance movement led by Hamas. “But I don’t think there was another option.”

Mullen, from UMass, said criticism of Hamas is often used to undermine the legitimacy of the Palestinian movement. She said she feels “deep sympathy for everyone involved” and doesn’t approve of the Oct. 7 attack, but said it wasn’t unprovoked.

Israel set the stage for violence by condemning Palestinians to live in “an open air prison or a concentration camp,” she said. “I think the way that the media portrays it makes it very difficult to understand but in reality it is a pretty straightforward conflict.”

Mullen began following the conflict in Israel and Gaza in October, after a few years mainly on the sidelines of political movements. She said she was confident in her understanding of the power dynamics in the Gaza Strip since Israel pulled out in 2005, but less familiar with the historic events that led to that point.

Friends from school showed her the Instagram feeds of several Palestinian journalists and she began reading Al Jazeera’s website. She saw photographs of Palestinian families buried in rubble and Gazan women holding their dead children. The carnage propelled her to act, she said. Mullen now wears a denim patch on her jacket that says “Free Palestine.”

Last month, Mullen was among about 500 UMass students who protested the school’s connection to an arms manufacturer and demanded the school condemn Israel’s actions in the war. Roughly 100 lined the hallway outside the university chancellor’s office, draping themselves with Palestinian scarves known as kaffiyehs and sporting Palestinian flags and signs like “Stop U.S. Aid to Apartheid Israel!”

A UMass Amherst spokesman said students were warned to leave or risk facing arrest when the building closed at 6 p.m.

Police placed Mullen’s hands behind her back and cuffed them with white zip ties around her wrists, she said. When she walked out of the office, supporters cheered and chanted, “One, two, three, four, we don’t want your dirty war!”

She said she felt proud, energized and empowered to use her “privilege as a white person” to speak out for people who are unable to speak for themselves.

“I felt I couldn’t sit back and see these images and just move on,” she said. “This is a moment in history that we have learned about over and over again, with different movements in the past, different things happening in the past when you’d say, ‘If I was there, I would have done something about it.’”

Harvard’s Hamas Confusion,2023-11-27T23:14:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['William Mcgurn'],"As Israel began exchanging Palestinian prisoners for Israeli moms and children, Harvard was dealing with its own ultimatum.

A week ago pro-Palestinian students gave university President Claudine Gay until Monday to respond to three demands. They were: that Harvard divest from any investments in “illegal settlements in Palestine”; that the university reinstate a proctor suspended for taking part in a mob that surrounded and harassed a Jewish student; and—of course—a promise from Harvard that “pro-Palestinian students and workers engaging in non-violent protest” would face no disciplinary action.

There you have it. The ethos of our modern best and brightest in a nutshell: We are taking a brave stand—but we demand that we pay no price for it.

In fairness, Harvard is no worse than most other universities here. Then again, that’s the scandal: It ought to be. Today the places that are supposed to be exemplars of how a civilized community behaves have become prone to loutish behavior as well as incoherent in their responses.

The ordinary citizen, by contrast, has little trouble recognizing that targeting innocent civilians instead of soldiers makes you a war criminal, not a soldier. Americans are consequently appalled by the pro-Hamas sentiment they see on so many campuses. The confusion has two parts.

The first is the way protest has morphed into a threat to speech. It isn’t only a matter of physical assaults or vandalism, though there’s been plenty of that. Harvard’s suspended proctor, graduate student Elom Tettey-Tamaklo, was captured in a video as part of the mob that blocked a Jewish student’s way while shouting “Shame!” at him. Mr. Tettey-Tamaklo was joined in this by Ibrahim Bharmal, an editor of the Harvard Law Review.

This isn’t speech. Students have the First Amendment right to espouse any idiocy they wish, such as the idea that Israel is entirely responsible for Hamas’s atrocities. But at a university ideas ought to be subject to civilized debate. Unfortunately, the purpose of the demonstrations these days is largely to make honest debate impossible by silencing, inconveniencing or intimidating those with opposing views.

One college president who understood this distinction was Rev. Theodore Hesburgh of Notre Dame. Hesburgh, who died in 2015, was a liberal and a dove on Vietnam, but one with a spine. In 1968 Notre Dame students protested

and Central Intelligence Agency recruiters by trying to force their fellow undergraduates to walk across their bodies to get to interviews. Father Ted was appalled.

In February 1969 he issued a famous letter saying that “anyone or any group that substitutes force for rational persuasion, be it violent or non-violent,” would be given 15 minutes. Those who persisted would have their IDs confiscated and be suspended or expelled. Then he enforced it.

College presidents used to recognize such discipline as part of their teaching responsibility. At Harvard, President Gay had to issue a clarifying statement after critics complained that her initial response to the Oct. 7 attacks failed to condemn Hamas explicitly.

The other part of the confusion is more substantive, and has to do with moral distinctions. Is it really that hard to make classic just-war distinctions between violence and force? Who is morally culpable when a combatant hides inside hospitals or behind civilians? What does it tell us about Hamas that increasing numbers of Palestinian deaths are part of its war strategy? Ask the questions. That’s what a university is for.

In 1643 Harvard’s founders adopted “Veritas,” or truth, as their motto, reflecting their belief that truth existed and could be discovered by reason. America’s founders appealed to this same understanding when they declared the truths they held self-evident. Today the most effective way to disabuse a student of the idea that he can know truth is to send him to an elite college.

Exhibit A is former President Barack Obama, Harvard Law ’91, reacting to the Hamas atrocities by saying truth requires “an admission of complexity.” Which turns out to mean we are all somehow complicit in the bloodshed. Apparently there are some things so stupid only someone from Harvard could say them.

With regard to the three student demands and Monday’s deadline, Harvard says “we do not have a comment nor a response to the letter”—the most sensible thing it has said about this mess. The Harvard Crimson reports that eight undergrads are also facing disciplinary hearings because of their 24-hour occupation of University Hall. But as Larry Arnn, president of Hillsdale, points out, what America really needs from Harvard is clear thinking.

“If colleges abandon their final cause, which is truth, their formal cause, which is civil discourse, soon breaks down into bullying, canceling, and extortion,” Mr. Arnn says.

“That disaster has struck colleges deeply, and now it spreads into the society. We become unable to distinguish the murderers from the defenders of children.”

The Real Reason Iran Hates Israel,2023-11-27T22:14:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Reuel Marc Gerecht', 'Ray Takeyh']","The Gaza War has led to another debate about what motivates Iran’s ruling elite. Washington has proffered primarily one realist theme: The mullahs wanted to disrupt the diplomacy aimed at Israeli-Saudi normalization, so they helped Hamas unleash a war to awaken the Arab street. Confronted with popular anger, the Arab potentates, they thought, would retreat.

But this ignores a fundamental motivation of Iran’s theocracy: anti-Semitism. At least three generations of radical Iranian clerics have viewed Israel as illegitimate, usurping sacred Islamic lands in the name of a pernicious ideology advanced by history’s most devilish and stubborn people. Using the language of French Marxism, they call Israel a Western “colonial-settler state,” and they believe Jews guide American imperialism in the Middle East. In this struggle between good and evil, Muslims have a religious obligation to resist Israel and global Jewry.

The founder of the revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, set the standard for the Islamic Republic of Iran. In his book “Islamic Government,” he wrote, “From the very beginning, the historical movement of Islam had to contend with the Jews, for it was they who first established anti-Islamic propaganda and engaged in various stratagems, and as you can see, this activity continues down to the present.” He depicted Jews as distorters of the Quran, financial hoarders, and agents of the West.

Khomeini’s anti-Semitic themes were picked up by his two most important disciples, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the “pragmatic” cleric par excellence, and the current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Rafsanjani published a book, “Israel and Beloved Jerusalem,” claiming that resistance to the Jewish state was the sacred duty of “every Muslim and anyone who believes in God.” Judaism for Rafsanjani was irretrievably “immersed in colonialism” and “Zionism is the essential partner of global arrogance [America].” Messrs. Rafsanjani and Khamenei green-lighted the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994, which left 85 dead and 300 wounded.

Holocaust denial is a natural consequence of this mentality. Mr. Khamenei has been the regime’s most imaginative inventor of such odious tales. “There are documents showing close collaboration of the Zionists with Nazi Germany, and exaggerated numbers relating to the Jewish Holocaust were fabricated to solicit the sympathy of world public opinion, to lay the ground for the occupation of Palestine, and to justify the atrocities of the Zionists,” Mr. Khamenei said in a 2001 speech, Iran’s state television reported. He has even turned Holocaust denial into a free-speech issue, saying in a 2002 address: “All politicians, all reporters, all intellectuals, all officials, all experts in the West should bow their heads to commemorate the gas chambers. That is, they should all endorse a tale the authenticity of which is not clear.”

For four decades, the Islamic Republic has created a propaganda machine of hate. Iranian state agencies have routinely published an infamous booklet—“The Protocols of the Elders of Zion”—and other anti-Semitic tracts. The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting airs anti-Semitic documentaries and TV series. Regime leaders, including Mr. Khamenei, have met routinely with Western Holocaust deniers at state-sanctioned conferences in Tehran. The International Holocaust Cartoon Contest, which Mr. Khamenei began in 2006, awards a prize to anti-Semitic art.

Iran’s position on the Middle East peace process has always been more extreme than that of most anti-Zionist Arab states. Iran has nurtured and armed rejectionist groups, such as Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. The clerical regime has repeatedly sent Hezbollah abroad to attack non-Israeli Jews.

Mr. Khamenei, who often speaks of Israel as a cancerous tumor on Islam’s body politic that must be excised, has insisted, referring to the Oct. 7 attack, that “the Zionist regime has suffered an irreparable defeat both in terms of military and intelligence. Everyone admitted the defeat but I emphasize irreparability.” Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani added, “If the war expands we cannot say that Israel would lose, because nothing will remain of Israel to be described as loser or winner.”

Iran’s continuous assault on the Jewish state aims to demoralize its people, batter its armed forces’ reputation, divide its politics, and, most important, provoke an exodus of its best and brightest.

Western statesmen and journalists have often seen the Iranian theocracy’s anti-Semitism as anti-Zionism, something turned on and off for Arab audiences by more sophisticated Persians. Many have consistently tried to isolate the regime’s anti-Semitism to a group of Iranian “hardliners”—even though these same men have always held power. Obviously it is easier for Barack Obama and Joe Biden to envision their nuclear diplomacy with Tehran as stabilizing and possibly transformative when Iran’s rulers aren’t seen as diehard, lethal anti-Semites. Imagine, however, if the Islamic Republic’s anti-Semitism were transmuted into a murderous creed targeting non-Jewish Americans? Would these presidents have been so keen to give billions in sanctions relief and seek a new modus vivendi with the U.S.?

Western policy toward Iran’s theocracy should see the regime as Mr. Khamenei does. Anti-Semitism isn’t adventitious, a passion that can be compartmentalized as pragmatism requires. Iranian expansionism—its support to radical militias throughout the Middle East—is impossible to understand properly without seeing the world as Iranian leaders do. They believe they are fighting a Jewish conspiracy that controls the West and intends to humble Muslims everywhere. Hamas’s war against Israel is part of that struggle.

Hamas Holds Everyone Hostage,2023-11-26T22:08:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['The Editorial Board'],"Hamas militants stand by vehicles as they hand over hostages who were abducted during the October 7 attack on Israel to members of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Sunday. Photo: al-qassam brigades, military win/Reuters

The civilized world is rejoicing at the release of hostages by Hamas, especially the sight of young children reunited with parents after seven weeks of hell. But that relief shouldn’t blind us to the way the jihadists are manipulating human sentiment to achieve their terrorist aims.

The killers are releasing a dozen or so hostages each day in return for three times the number of Palestinians released by Israel. Hamas snatched innocent Israelis and others in a deliberate act of terror. The released Palestinians were arrested or convicted of crimes under the law."
The World Again Needs American Leadership,2023-11-26T21:33:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Liz Truss'],"For as long as most of us can recall, the U.S. has led the free world. During the Cold War, for example, it was American power that successfully held off the communist threat from the Soviet Union. Working in tandem with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , President Ronald Reagan was unflinching, calling the Soviet Union an “evil empire.”

The world would benefit from more of that kind of American leadership today. I hope that a Republican will be returned to the White House in 2024. There must be conservative leadership in the U.S. that is once again bold enough to call out hostile regimes as evil and a threat.

Too many of us in the Western world became complacent about the defeat of our communist enemies and believed that victory was everlasting for freedom and democracy. In reality no such victories are permanent.

The West allowed China to join the World Trade Organization as a developing nation—on beneficial terms it enjoys to this day—as President Xi Jinping proceeded to make himself president for life, clamped down on democracy and freedom of speech in Hong Kong and presided over human-rights abuses in Xinjiang province.

Meantime Iran is backing terrorists such as Hamas and developing its own nuclear capability—all while the U.S. waits in vain for Tehran to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. And Vladimir Putin’s territorial ambitions are ever more hostile.

Is it any wonder these regimes have proceeded with impunity when their actions haven’t properly been called out by others? The failure to enforce, for example, the red line in Syria, and America’s withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, emboldened these regimes further.

I saw the effect of these actions during my time in the British Cabinet as foreign secretary and prime minister. And while I was proud to ensure that the U.K. was the first country in Europe to supply weapons to Ukraine, I would rather that we had not been in that situation in the first place.

Russia, China and Iran are seeking to defeat democracy. Any victory will give succor to the others and further embolden these dictators. We must ensure a total Ukrainian victory and defeat of the Russian invaders.

To tilt the balance in favor of Ukraine, we must ensure that Ukraine has a quantitative military advantage when it is facing off against a Russian military backed by Iranian weapons and diplomatic support from the Chinese. Today, Ukraine most urgently needs to establish air superiority either through stealth jets or advanced drones that can support front-line troops. We should also be fast-tracking its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Moscow has been lulled into a delusion that its military can stand up to Washington’s might. But the West must ensure Ukraine has the weapons it needs to deliver a knockout blow to Russia. This would send a blunt message to Russia’s authoritarian benefactors in China and Iran.

On China, we must provide weapons and defense capability to Taiwan, which we know Beijing has in its sights. Western business leaders should stop ingratiating themselves with President Xi, who needs to be called out for the totalitarian dictator he is.

And on Iran, the nuclear deal should be abandoned and tougher sanctions imposed on Tehran. No more cash should be funneled to a regime that has been funding terrorists and their murderous exploits.

During the Cold War, the U.S. led an alliance of the free world, including the U.K. and Japan, in controlling exports to China and the communist countries of Eastern Europe. The U.S. should lead the free world again in ensuring we aren’t exporting technology or goods that could be used against us—an economic NATO.

Finally, all of us in the West must halt the rot we have allowed to develop within our own societies that attacks the Anglo-American values of patriotism, freedom and family.

Whether it be the anticapitalist excesses of extreme environmentalists or the radical woke agenda being promoted in our schools and on our campuses, we urgently need to counter ideologies that undermine our way of life and give succor to our enemies. The future of the West depends on it.

Don’t Give Gaza to the Palestinian Authority,2023-11-26T18:12:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Eugene Kontorovich', 'Itamar Marcus']","The Biden administration wants Israel to bring in Mahmoud Abbas ’s Fatah party to rule Gaza when the war is over. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which governs much of the West Bank. Uniting Gaza and the West Bank under a common government is a necessary step in the Biden administration’s seemingly unshakable goal of creating a Palestinian state sandwiching Israel.

The idea behind the strategy has a long history. Fatah is a secular, Arab nationalist party that occasionally claims to want peace with Israel, albeit on terms that would make Israel’s existence as a Jewish state untenable. Yet for many diplomats this makes it an attractive alternative to the terrorists who perpetrated the Oct. 7 attacks. But Fatah is a junior-varsity version of Hamas. Both have lethal policies when it comes to Israel. The Palestinian Authority sponsors the “pay to slay” salary program that provides financial rewards to terrorists, who get more lavish payouts for crimes that result in longer imprisonment. As recently as Oct. 2, an official Palestinian Authority TV broadcast showed Mr. Abbas saying: “Our martyrs, prisoners and wounded are the most sanctified that we have. . . . Our martyrs have a right to this money.”

Fatah has celebrated and glorified the Oct. 7 orgy of torture and murder. The party has boasted that its members directly participated in the invasion, crossing into Israel and brutalizing civilians. A video shown on a West Bank-based Telegram channel that has been repeatedly cited by official Fatah sources shows terrorists with the yellow headbands of Fatah’s Al Aqsa Martyr’s Brigade firing Kalashnikovs while assaulting an Israeli kibbutz. One terrorist proclaims, “Today we broke in the military post Nahal Oz [a civilian kibbutz] and we hit what we hit.” The terrorists brag that they “stepped on their heads,” and shows footage of them stomping a dead Israeli.

Other videos on Fatah channels boast of their participation, proclaiming that Fatah is “fighting with the rest of the resistance groups in ‘the Al Aqsa Flood’ battle,” using Hamas’s operational name for the massacre. On Oct. 7, death notices appeared on Telegram announcing the funerals (or “weddings,” as they put it) of Fatah members who died that morning in the attack on Israel.

One such post shows a coffin draped with the yellow Fatah flag adorned with the Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades logo, which includes crossed rifles and a grenade above Jerusalem’s Dome of the Rock. The photo’s caption says the deceased had “ascended” to heaven as a martyr “during his armed confrontation together with his brothers against the Zionist occupation soldiers in our occupied lands.”

These death notices also reveal the involvement of other Palestinian factions such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Fatah and the other factions didn’t plan or lead the operation, since they lack the resources in Gaza to do so. But, based on their own claims, they piggybacked on the atrocity. Reports began circling on Nov. 19 that the Al Aqsa Brigade had taken and held hostages from Israel but transferred them to Hamas.

The Palestinian Authority in Ramallah hasn’t responded the way a government might when armed gangs under its ruling party’s banner cross a border, kill civilians and boast about doing so. Fatah officials haven’t disavowed the terrorists. Instead they’ve celebrated their dirty work. The official Palestinian Authority news agency described the attack as a “heroic battle” and called on Palestinians to escalate “confrontation in all arenas.” A senior Fatah official proclaimed on Palestinian television on Oct. 10 that “our brothers in the Gaza Strip . . . are a source of pride, heroism, and honor.” Mr. Abbas responded immediately on Oct. 7 by declaring Palestinian “right to self-defense.”

Mr. Abbas hasn’t even denounced the holding of innocent hostages by members of his faction. His adviser Mahmoud Al-Habbash made this clear: “Has anyone heard from President Mahmoud Abbas . . . one word against the Hamas Movement?” Many see senior Palestinian Authority official Hussein Al-Sheikh as a possible successor to Mr. Abbas. Mr. Al-Sheikh went further, announcing that now is the time for Palestinian unity with the terrorists.

The evidence of actual participation by Fatah members, combined with the endorsement by official Fatah organs, should disqualify Fatah and any government of which it is a part from any leadership role in Gaza. The difference between Fatah and Hamas is one of degree, not kind. They are both evil.

One of Hamas’s top leaders, Khalil al-Hayya, has said the broader goal of the attack was “putting the Palestinian issue back on the table.” When his terrorists invaded on Oct. 7, the plan was to race across the narrow waist of Israel and hook up with their comrades in the West Bank. Hamas wanted to cut the Jewish state in two. The Biden administration’s vision is a diplomatic version of this, connecting Gaza administratively to the West Bank.

Israel will win this war. Hamas will be defeated. The international community can’t expect a victorious Israel to implement any version of its adversaries’ aims. Handing Gaza to the Palestinian Authority would do just that.

The United Nations’ Treatment of Israel Is Shameful,2023-11-26T18:10:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Eli Cohen'],"Flags fly at half-mast at the United Nations headquarters in New York as staff observe a minute of silence for colleagues killed in Gaza, Nov. 13.

The United Nations is suffering from acute moral failure and can’t fulfill its core mission.

Israel joined the U.N. in 1949. Universal humanitarian values, civil liberties, the rule of law and political accountability have always been the foundations of Israeli society. We adhere fully to the U.N. charter, which mandates that members maintain international peace and security, uphold international law, achieve higher standards of living for their citizens, and promote universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, gender, language or religion.

Yet since Oct. 7, Israel has been fighting a war for survival against an enemy whose goal is our total annihilation. We are the only democracy in a region dominated by violent authoritarian regimes. Israel’s enemies are deliberately violating all principles of the U.N. Charter, international humanitarian law and basic human decency. They are committing a double war crime by hiding among—and firing from within—their own civilian population, while also targeting civilians in Israel.

The atrocities Hamas committed on Oct. 7 were appalling crimes against humanity. Terrorists killed more than 1,200 people and abducted some 240—including 35 children and 18 elderly—denying them vital medical treatment and preventing access to them by the Red Cross.

You would think such flagrant acts of evil would elicit the strongest of condemnations. Yet the U.N., its agencies, and its secretary general, fail even to address the crimes of Hamas and other Iranian terror proxies. Some examples:

On Oct. 27, the General Assembly adopted a resolution against Israel that doesn’t even mention Hamas and its atrocities, nor Israel’s right to self-defense against terror invasions. Secretary General António Guterres has perversely implied that Israel was itself somehow to blame for the attack. His joviality in the company of the Iranian minister of foreign affairs on Oct. 28 was likewise telling. It revealed his complicity with a regime that actively supplies weapons to butcher civilians in Israel, Ukraine and elsewhere.

Schools run by the U.N.’s Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, teach explicit antisemitism. Unrwa infrastructure is continually abused by terrorists. Hamas routinely steals its fuel, food and medicines.

On Nov. 2, Iran took over as chair of the U.N. Human Rights Council Social Forum. This appalling appointment of a regime that tramples the social and human rights of its own citizens illustrates the U.N.’s failure to defend the most basic principles of its own founding charter.

The U.N.’s betrayal of its own mandate is not new for Israel, which has been the object of double standards and hypocritical policies for decades. Narrow political interests displace basic values and human decency in Turtle Bay, enabling the world’s most violent anti-Western forces to exploit the U.N. and promote an agenda radically opposed to its charter and stated goals.

Israel is today at the forefront of the struggle against those forces aimed at the destruction of the free world. The failure of the U.N.’s leader and institutions to stick to its values and to defend Israel is a bad omen indeed.

Hamas Releases Hostages After Delay Over Aid Dispute,2023-11-25T11:52:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Sune Engel Rasmussen', 'Summer Said', 'Abeer Ayyoub']","A second group of Israeli hostages returned to Israel after being released by Hamas as part of a temporary cease-fire deal that has paused fighting in the Gaza Strip and provided a glimmer of hope for relatives of the remaining captives in the enclave.

Thirteen Israelis, including five women and eight children as young as 3, 8 and 9, alongside four Thai men, arrived in Israel late on Saturday. The release was delayed for hours due to a dispute over the delivery of more aid to the Gaza Strip that illustrated the fragility of a deal that was weeks in the making.

All of the hostages were in stable condition, Israeli hospitals said.

As part of the agreement, Israel freed 39 more Palestinian prisoners, a group also made up of women and minors, whose release was welcomed in the city of al-Bireh in the occupied West Bank by cheering crowds, some of whom waved Palestinian and Hamas flags.

The Israeli prime minister’s office said it has received a list of the next group of hostages to be released Sunday.

The released hostages were all part of roughly 240 people taken to Gaza during the attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7. Many of them were from Kibbutz Be’eri near the border with Gaza. After an initial medical assessment, one of the hostages, 21-year-old Maya Regev, was taken to a hospital for critical care, while the rest were transferred to other hospitals where they would reunite with their families, Israeli authorities said.

Saturday’s hostage release was delayed for hours after Hamas refused to hand over the captives until Israel allowed more aid into the enclave, Egyptian officials said. Israel had committed to allowing at least 200 trucks of aid into Gaza each day. According to the United Nations, 137 trucks entered Gaza on Friday, and 133 had entered on Saturday at the time of the delay. In the evening, after the dispute, the number reached 185.

Aside from the aid dispute, Hamas had also contended Israel was violating the terms of an agreement to free Palestinian prisoners in order of jail time served, with the longest-serving to be freed first. After the deal faced hurdles on Saturday, President Biden spoke directly to the emir of Qatar, which has helped mediate the agreement, and the country’s prime minister, said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council.

After that call, senior U.S. officials were in contact with the Israelis, Qataris and Egyptians to overcome hurdles to hand over the hostages.

Hamas also violated the agreement by separating a mother from her family, releasing 12-year-old Hila Rotem Shoshani but keeping her mother, Ra’aya Rotem, in captivity, the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum and Kibbutz Be’eri said.

“Today is a bittersweet day, one of great joy but also marked with sadness,” the groups said.

The family of Emily Hand, who turned 9 years old in Hamas captivity, found it hard to describe their feelings after the past 50 “challenging and complicated days,” while some hostages remained in Gaza, it said in a statement.

On Friday, Hamas handed over 13 Israelis. It also liberated 10 Thais and a Philippines citizen, who weren’t part of the deal. In return, Israel released 39 prisoners. Earlier this week, Israel agreed to release 150 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in return for Hamas releasing a total of 50 hostages over four days, during which the fighting would be halted.

The hostage release capped a second day of a fragile cease-fire holding in Gaza as residents surveyed the human loss and damage of seven weeks of devastating war.

The planned four-day pause in fighting comes after an Israeli military campaign that so far has killed more than 14,500 Gazans, the majority women and children, according to authorities in the Hamas-controlled enclave. The numbers don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants.

The Israeli campaign came in response to the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, which Israel says killed 1,200 people, including some 850 civilians. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S.

The halt in fighting has allowed some displaced Palestinians to briefly return home to check on their houses and belongings. At least 1.7 million people, or roughly 75% of Gaza’s population, have been displaced by the conflict, and nearly half of the enclave’s residences are destroyed or severely damaged, according to the United Nations.

Fatin Salim, a 35-year-old mother of two, left her house in al-Bureij, a refugee camp in central Gaza near the border with Israel, on the first day of the war, anticipating that it would be damaged in the fighting. But she wasn’t prepared for the destruction she saw when she finally returned home on Friday.

“I went to check on the house first thing in the morning. I was hoping to see that it was partially damaged, or to be able to get some of my children’s clothes,” she said. “I was shocked. It was totally destroyed, flattened to the ground.” She said the only thing she was able to retrieve from her belongings was her university certificate.

“I spent the whole day crying. I don’t know where we will end up after this war is over,” Salim said.

The release of Israeli hostages offered a glimmer of hope for relatives of other captives who received the first proof of life from their family members after 50 days of anguish and uncertainty.

Noam Peri, whose 79-year-old father Haim is being held in Gaza, said some of the hostages released on Friday had confirmed that he was alive, the first news she had received of him since militants stormed the Nir Oz kibbutz where he lived with her mother. The longtime peace activist fended them off for long enough for his wife to hide, evading capture.

“We know he’s alive from other people in the community who were released yesterday,” Peri said in a news conference in Tel Aviv. “It brings a lot of hope.”

Despite the good news, Peri said she remained concerned about her father’s health. “We know the conditions are very hard, especially for old and ill people,” she said. “It’s hard to breathe there; we don’t even know if he can stand in the place he’s kept.”

Palestinians across the Gaza Strip await news of their loved ones, as telecommunications have been damaged and disrupted by the war. The Palestine Telecommunications Company, or Paltel, said its teams had managed to reach Gaza City and northern Gaza on Friday evening to begin repairs.

Israeli authorities didn’t allow displaced people to return north where Israel has focused most of the fighting, including in and around Gaza City, in its effort to destroy Hamas. Yet, several thousand Palestinians attempted to move from southern Gaza to the north on Friday, resulting in several incidents of Israeli forces opening fire and using tear gas, according to the U.N.

Despite the cease-fire, 34-year-old Nour Ahmad, who fled Gaza City to the south with her husband and children, still hasn’t been able to reach her parents for a week. Ahmad’s sister was killed early in the war, and her parents refused to leave their home in Al-Shati, a refugee camp near the beach in the city, even as clashes intensified.

Ahmad has been posting on social media requests for anyone in Gaza City to check on her parents, who had been living without phone lines or electricity, not knowing whether they were still alive.

“If just one person could go to my parents’ house and tell me they are fine, I would be relieved,” she said. So far no one responded to her calls.

Muhammad Nasrallah, 32, who had fled from Gaza City to the southern border town of Rafah, said the cease-fire was useless if people weren’t allowed to travel home.

“As long as I am in a tent, there is no cease-fire,” he said. “We don’t have anything left there, everything is destroyed, but we want to stay on the rubble of our homes.”

Palestinians shouldn’t expect the lull in fighting to last for long, Israeli military officials say. Once the pause in fighting is over, the Israeli military will resume its efforts to crush Hamas, including in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, Assaf Orion, Israeli reserve brigadier general and former head of the strategic division at the Israel Defense Forces, told reporters in Tel Aviv Saturday.

Hamas will use the pause as best it can to “recuperate, to rearm, to reorganize and try to set ambushes and traps before our forces,” Orion said. “And once the pause is over, we will resume fighting, which means that we need to go to places yet unvisited to meet enemies that were not engaged yet and to continue with our mission.”

The notion that the war would continue worried Israelis whose relatives were still kept hostage. Menashe Harush, who is from the southern Israeli city of Kiryat Gat, said he believed the return of his cousin, Elkana Buchbut, who was kidnapped by Hamas while working as a bartender at a music festival near the Gaza border, was now unlikely.

“They don’t want to return the men,” Harush, 77, said of Hamas. “They have retrieved the children and elderly to show the public they’ve done their part—only to forget the rest.”

"For Biden, Israel Hostage Deal Provides Reprieve From Political Pressure",2023-11-24T16:13:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Ken Thomas', 'Annie Linskey']","President Biden has been reluctant to push for a full cease-fire, pointing to the need to first win the release of hostages.

NANTUCKET, Mass.—The Thanksgiving week deal between Israel and Hamas to secure a multiday pause in the fighting in Gaza to allow for the release of hostages, including Americans, provides President Biden with a reprieve from the pressure of Democrats urging a full cease-fire. But only a temporary one.

Biden was heavily involved in the agreement that came together after weeks of tense negotiations among the U.S., Qatar and Egypt and was approved by the Israeli cabinet following long deliberations. He called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu more than a dozen times, including this week, and was also personally in touch with other leaders as the talks progressed.

Negotiators raced to overcome last-minute sticking points that threatened to derail the effort before announcing a Friday start date, a day later than originally intended.

The deal is expected to lead to the release of 50 women and children held hostage by Hamas over the next four days, including three Americans, while providing a respite to the fighting and limitations on drone surveillance; the first group of hostages was released by Hamas Friday afternoon local time, Egyptian officials said.

The first group didn’t include Americans, but a White House official said the administration remained hopeful that Americans will be among the 50.

“It’s only a start but so far it’s gone well,” Biden said.

Facing re-election next year, Biden has been under pressure from progressive lawmakers and voters, particularly younger ones, in his party to push for a full cease-fire in the nearly seven-week conflict. Biden has been reluctant to do so, pointing to the need to first win the release of hostages and warning that any extended pause could allow Hamas to regroup and commit more attacks.

The deal shows that Biden is having some influence over the Israelis, who have resisted halts in fighting, and that he is making progress in an area that the White House has repeatedly named a priority: Returning U.S. hostages.

“I think this is going to be a real positive,” said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who works on progressive causes and was part of Biden’s 2020 campaign. The deal ties together freeing hostages with a pause in fighting, two issues that have deeply troubled voters.

“Who’s on the side of humanitarianism is up for debate by the different sides,” said Lake, noting that Biden has been painted as insensitive to the lives of Palestinians as the conflict has dragged on and images of the war have become ubiquitous on social-media feeds. “And what this does is it puts everybody on the side of humanitarianism.”

Biden’s response to the Middle East war has strained enthusiasm among parts of the coalition that helped him defeat former President Donald Trump in 2020. Polls consistently show that young people, who broadly supported him three years ago, dislike his approach to the war.

These surveys include a recent NBC News poll that found 70% of voters between the ages of 18 and 34 disapprove of how Biden is handling the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The same poll showed that 51% of Democrats approve of how Biden is approaching the war.

“I don’t think the wounds within the party are healed at all, and I can expect that it’ll probably get worse from here,” said Waleed Shahid, a Democratic strategist who has worked for leading progressive lawmakers and causes. “You’re going to see more proof of concept for the progressive argument that there’s no military solution to this conflict.”

The Biden administration initially took a strongly pro-Israel response to the Hamas attacks, but became more nuanced as political pressure grew, and he has shown a willingness to criticize Israelis, particularly the West Bank settlers who have caused significant friction in the region. Biden and the administration also have consistently said Israel has a right to defend itself against the Hamas attacks.

The hostage deal is the strongest sign to date that the Israeli government is heeding U.S. calls to calibrate their military response. It raised expectations among some Democrats that the conflict could enter a new phase with a more targeted approach to Hamas and greater care taken to preserving civilian lives.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), in a New York Times op-ed, wrote that the reprieve was a “promising first step that we can build upon, and hopefully work to extend the pause.”

“This extended pause must not precede a resumption of indiscriminate bombing. Israel will continue to go after Hamas, but it must dramatically change its tactics to minimize civilian harm,” Sanders wrote.

The suspension of intense fighting coincides with Biden’s effort to win approval in Congress for roughly $14 billion in aid for Israel. Sanders and other progressives have said any aid to Netanyahu’s government must be conditioned on a halt to bombing and to settler violence in the West Bank and a commitment that Israel won’t occupy Gaza.

Nearly all leading Republicans, meanwhile, have been staunchly pro-Israel and critical of calls for a cease-fire. Few in the GOP have spoken out on the hostage deal. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, a 2024 presidential candidate, posted on X that she was “overjoyed that families may soon be reunited with their loved ones. But the world must demand more from Hamas. Why only 50 hostages?” She didn’t reference Biden.

White House officials characterized the deal as one of patient diplomacy and expressed hope that it would inject a degree of calm into the region after intense fighting. But they were reluctant to frame the diplomatic breakthrough as far-reaching, noting the lack of trust between Hamas and Israel even as they hoped the release of some hostages would be a building block of future negotiations.

“We’re not going into this with hubris or arrogance or ultra-confidence. We’re grateful that we were able to get this deal secured,” said John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council in an interview with CNN. “It all now comes down to execution.”

Biden, who is spending the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, held separate calls from the island with the leaders of Israel, Qatar and Egypt, who helped broker the deal. The conversation with Netanyahu included assurances that work will continue to secure the release of additional hostages, and Biden stressed “the importance of maintaining calm” along the border with Lebanon and in the West Bank, according to the White House. To both Arab leaders, Biden stressed that he backs the creation of a Palestinian state, the White House said.

Pro-Palestinian activists applauded the release of hostages and pause in fighting, but said they believe it shows the benefit of their favored approach of a full cease-fire.

On Friday, Biden faced shouts of “Free Palestine!” and passed protesters while shopping and attending a tree-lighting ceremony in Nantucket.

“What this demonstrates is what those calling for a cease-fire have been saying for over a month, which is that diplomacy and negotiations is the only way out of this crisis,” said Eva Borgwardt, the national spokeswoman for IfNotNow, a Jewish group pushing for a full stop to the fighting.

Rep. Ritchie Torres (D., N.Y.), who has supported Biden’s pro-Israel policy, noted that the hostage deal represents a rejection of the unconditional cease-fire that some of his colleagues have backed. “If Israel had entered into a permanent, unconditional cease-fire, it would have no leverage to secure the release of the hostages,” Torres said.

The deal that Biden helped broker, he said, is a “win, win, win”—because it releases some of the most vulnerable hostages, allows humanitarian aid to Gaza and keeps Israel focused on the larger goal of removing Hamas.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Hamas’s Cease-Fire Game Plan: Outlast Israel and Survive,2023-11-24T13:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Rory Jones', 'Dov Lieber', 'Abeer Ayyoub']","TEL AVIV—Hamas leaders are heading into a temporary cease-fire with a singular mission: survival.

Israel has defined its war aims as toppling Hamas from power, killing its leadership, freeing the more than 200 hostages in Gaza and ending any security threat from the strip. The four-day pause gives Hamas time to prepare a new phase of the war that could last months, with the aim of sapping the momentum of Israel’s offensive and creating international pressure to end the conflict without achieving its goals, military analysts said.

“The most important thing for now is to guarantee their survival,” Yossi Kuperwasser, former head of research in Israel’s military intelligence division, said of Hamas. The group, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., hopes it can release hostages gradually, turning “this entire idea of defeating Hamas into something that will never happen,” he said.

Israel says the pause in fighting isn’t going to deter the Israeli military from destroying Hamas’s ability to launch attacks against Israel. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is also facing a growing movement to secure the release of hostages first—and the pressure is expected to increase as the first set of captives return home Friday.

Hamas’s leaders already believe they scored a big victory with the Oct. 7 attacks just by inflicting an intelligence and military blow on Israel and by keeping its senior leaders safe from the Israeli invasion. The question now is whether Hamas can manipulate the hostage crisis enough to also remain in power in Gaza or so its leadership can escape from the strip.

Taher Al-Nono, a spokesman for Hamas based in Istanbul, said it is open to talks about extending the truce and ultimately wants a cease-fire. “But Israel has no right to decide who will control Gaza after the war,” he said.

Hamas’s leadership is made up of roughly 15 members, normally based in Gaza, Doha and Beirut, and makes decisions based on consensus. But the group’s war strategy is now closely held inside Gaza and potentially unknown even to Hamas’s political leadership in exile, making its next moves hard to foresee.

Israel believes Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is directing operations with a tightly held group, potentially including the head of the militant arm, Mohammed Deif, and a few other senior commanders. Those negotiating the hostage and prisoner swap say Sinwar has been unresponsive at times, frustrating the process, but is the ultimate decision maker.

Sinwar is set to achieve one of his main aims from launching the Oct. 7 attacks by securing the release of prisoners. Analysts say freeing those incarcerated is personal for Sinwar, a former prisoner himself.

In the first phase of the agreement, Hamas has committed to releasing 50 hostages, in exchange for a four-day cease-fire and the release of three Palestinian prisoners for every hostage freed. But Israeli officials say Hamas and others in Gaza are holding up to 100 women and children as hostages. According to the agreement, Israel agreed to add an additional day of a cease-fire for every additional batch of 10 female or child hostages released on top of the original 50 agreed on. That means Hamas can draw out the cease-fire for up to nine days according to the current agreement.

Sinwar will seek to use the pause and the prospect of the future release of hostages to lengthen the cease-fire beyond the four days and win the freedom of Palestinians imprisoned on more serious charges than those being released in the first phase of the fighting pause, analysts said.

“The priority for Hamas is releasing Palestinian prisoners,” said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political scientist at Birzeit University in the West Bank. “There have been lots of sacrifices, lots of losses, lots of damages, so they need to show achievements in return.”

Israel estimates Hamas had about 30,000 fighters at the start of the conflict. A senior Israeli military official said it had targeted Hamas’s commanders in recent fighting in northern Gaza to disrupt the group’s ability to direct combatants. The Israeli military doesn’t have a firm estimate of the damage to Hamas’s army but believes it has killed 3,000 to 10,000 fighters and dented the group’s ability to launch assaults on Israeli soldiers.

The Israeli military believes Sinwar is now located in Hamas’s tunnel network in the southern part of Gaza with senior commanders and hostages, according to Ehud Yaari, a fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy and well-known Israeli commentator.

While the pause will give Hamas the opportunity to regroup, Israel is expected to launch a major offensive against Sinwar’s hometown, Khan Younis, hoping to cut off the north and south and force Hamas either to emerge from tunnels to fight or surrender. “For Hamas, if the battle stops before Khan Younis is attacked, they are still left standing on their feet,” said Yaari.

A fight in the south would be more challenging than the north because of the presence of displaced Palestinians which could deepen a humanitarian crisis and increase international pressure on Israel to stop the war, said Giora Eiland, a former Israeli general and national-security adviser.

Hamas’s tunnel network and the presence of hostages there also complicate an operation in the south, he said. “As long as they can use these tunnels as a haven for combatants, it is very hard to win there,” he added.

Depriving Hamas of fuel, water and food could force fighters out of tunnels. But Sinwar has the remaining hostages as leverage to negotiate safe passage for himself and other leaders such as Deif out of Gaza, or another truce.

Israel has experience laying siege to an area to achieve military aims. During the Lebanese Civil War in 1982, the Israeli military surrounded the capital, Beirut, forcing the Palestine Liberation Organization to evacuate fighters from Lebanon in an internationally brokered deal.

But Palestinian analysts say Hamas is unlikely to leave given its fighters are from Gaza. Some Middle Eastern officials believe Israel will face an insurgency if it seeks to demilitarize Gaza and keep its forces there. Few Israelis and Palestinians believe Israel will be able to destroy Hamas as both a military organization and a political movement.

Israeli military officials say they know Hamas’s ideology can’t be eliminated but argue it is possible to eradicate the group’s ability to wage war and govern Gaza.

Mairav Zonszein, a senior Israel-Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, said Israel could face a choice between killing Hamas’s top leaders and negotiating for the release of the remaining hostages.

“At the end, Israel is going to have to decide if it’s going to get all of its people back or face some kind of negotiation,” with Sinwar and Deif, she said. “Netanyahu really hopes he can assassinate them before that happens. But at the end of the day, Israel is not going to be able to ‘destroy Hamas’ and get all the hostages back.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
The Hostage Deal Means Israel Is Fighting the Clock,2023-11-22T23:22:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Dominic Green'],"With a four-day cease-fire reportedly going into effect Friday, time isn’t on Israel’s side in its war with Hamas in Gaza. Israel already faces challenges unprecedented in the history of war. A terrorist enemy dedicated to its destruction holds hundreds of hostages in a complex tunnel network and uses civilians as human shields. Israeli society, already riven by political infighting, is traumatized by Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault and divided over how to handle the hostage crisis. Further cease-fires mean the recovery of more hostages, but this will slow and eventually halt Israel’s effort to break Hamas’s control over Gaza. That would be a strategic defeat for both Israel and the U.S.

Israel needs time to root out Hamas. But the longer the war goes on, the likelier it is to spiral into a regional conflict drawing in the U.S. Since Oct. 17, Iranian-supplied militias have hit U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria with more than 60 rocket attacks. If a rocket or drone kills American troops, the Biden administration will face a crisis of its own. It could either retaliate against Iran and risk unpredictable military, economic and electoral consequences, or retreat from the Mideast, abandoning Israel and ceding a crucial region in the U.S.’s great-power struggle with China.

Few observers are better placed to understand these dilemmas than Michael Oren. An Israeli-American historian of the U.S.’s relationship with the Middle East, Mr. Oren served in Gaza with the Israel Defense Forces, then advised on several rounds of peace negotiations with the Palestinians. He was Israel’s ambassador to Washington during the Obama years. He held the Gaza brief as Benjamin Netanyahu’s deputy prime minister.

Mr. Oren praises President Biden’s forthright support of Israel. He agrees with the president’s statement that “a ceasefire is not peace” as long as Hamas “clings to its ideology of destruction.” It is war by other means, allowing the terrorists to “rebuild their stockpile of rockets, reposition fighters and restart the killing by attacking innocents again.” Mr. Oren expects U.S. and international pressure for cease-fires to grow “exponentially” in the coming weeks.

A cease-fire deprives Israel of military momentum and transfers the initiative to Hamas. Now that Israel has agreed to a short cease-fire, the Biden administration and its Qatari interlocutors will expect longer cease-fires. Hamas will remain armed and dangerous in Gaza, despite Israel’s war aims and the U.S.’s stated goals, and will use this cease-fire to regroup. The cease-fire’s terms allow Hamas to extend the truce by releasing 10 hostages a day. As the possibility of a permanent truce nears, and as Hamas starts to trade adult, male and military hostages, the group’s demands will rise. The U.S. will pressure Israel to release hundreds of Palestinian terrorists.

The partial hostage release also increases pressure inside Israel for further cease-fires. Israeli society, and Mr. Netanyahu’s cabinet, are already split by a real-life “Sophie’s choice”: Who is returned home, and who is left behind? The Israeli government insists its Gaza campaign will resume once the cease-fire lapses, but a combination of domestic and international pressures may prevent Israel from regaining military momentum. The State Department is already refusing to endorse an Israeli move into southern Gaza, citing humanitarian concerns.

A temporary cease-fire that becomes permanent is incompatible with the Biden administration’s commitment to Israel’s security. More than 200,000 Israelis are internally displaced from the southern regions adjoining Gaza and the northern border with Lebanon. This cease-fire with Hamas won’t return those Israelis home. It will, however, embolden Iran and its proxies, none of whom are parties to the cease-fire deal. Hezbollah’s attacks across Israel’s northern border have intensified in recent weeks, as has the pace of rocket attacks by Iranian-sponsored militias on American bases in Iraq and Syria. The Houthis of Yemen, removed from the Foreign Terrorist Organizations list when the Biden administration came into office, have hijacked a cargo ship in the Red Sea and launched ballistic missiles at Israel.

“What’s going to happen when the message gets out that we can be hit more or less with impunity, and when we try to defend ourselves, someone’s going to slap a cease-fire on us?” Mr. Oren asks.

Restoring Israel’s deterrence is a matter of survival for the Jewish state. It’s also an asset that the U.S. is defending by resupplying Israel and sending out two carrier strike groups to the region. Israelis now appreciate the indispensability of American support more than at any time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. It’s vital the Biden administration uses its leverage wisely.

Mr. Oren endorses reports that after Oct. 7 Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant advised launching a pre-emptive strike on Hezbollah before addressing Hamas’s smaller rocket arsenal in Gaza. Mr. Gallant was overruled in the cabinet partly, Mr. Oren believes, because of “tremendous pressure” from the Biden administration. The president’s one-word warning to Iran and its assets—“Don’t”—also applies to Israel.

Mr. Oren hears several clocks ticking at once. A short cease-fire won’t slow any of them, and it will exacerbate some of their pressures. There is the “ammo clock”: The IDF needs to be resupplied consistently with U.S.-made advanced munitions. There is the “reservist clock”: Israel has mobilized an army equivalent to those of Britain and France combined; its young men and women, he says, form “the backbone of our high-tech economy.” There is the “economic clock”: Foreign investment and tourism have collapsed, and Israel is burning money on the war. There is the “humanitarian clock”: Footage continues to show civilian casualties and more than a million displaced Gazans.

Israel needs to stop these clocks to survive. The Biden administration should create time and diplomatic space for Israel’s forces to break Hamas. That means preventing the terrorists from setting the timetable in the Gaza war, letting Israel strike Hezbollah as necessary, and re-establishing American deterrence against Iranian-sponsored rocket attacks. It also means rethinking America’s Iran strategy.

Israel’s leaders, Mr. Oren among them, made the mistake of believing Hamas could be bought off with Qatari cash and work permits. The Obama administration, he says, “made the same mistake” about Iran. The Biden administration, which transferred $6 billion to Iran to secure the release of five American hostages in September and allowed sanctions on Iran’s missile technology to lapse, is under the same delusion. The Democrats’ long campaign to escape the Mideast by placating Iran has “completely boomeranged” in “abject failure,” Mr. Oren says. The U.S. has been dragged back into the region by Iranian-sponsored aggression.

Two other clocks are ticking: the countdown to Iran’s nuclear breakout and the countdown to what Mr. Oren calls the “crunch” moment when an Iranian missile takes American lives or hits a U.S. Navy vessel. That would also be a direct hit on “the contradictions of American policy.” Time is tight for Israel, but the U.S. is approaching a fateful moment too.

Inside Israel’s Campaign to Prove a Gaza Hospital Was a Hamas Command Center,2023-11-22T13:19:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Dov Lieber In Tel Aviv', 'Omar Abdel-Baqui In Dubai', 'Dov Lieber', 'Omar Abdel-Baqui']","The Israeli military has stepped up its efforts to produce evidence that Gaza’s largest hospital was a Hamas command center, as the humanitarian fallout from war and seizure of Al-Shifa Hospital has heaped pressure on Israel.

In recent days, the Israeli military has released a series of videos and photos from the hospital that show further details of a tunnel uncovered at the site and security-camera footage of two hostages who were brought there Oct. 7, the day Israel says Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 200 hostages back to Gaza.

On Tuesday, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said its troops were still inside Al-Shifa Hospital searching for Hamas’s tunnels and other evidence. He said the evidence released so far was just the beginning. “At the end of our search we will put everything on display for the world to see,” Conricus said.

Late Wednesday, the Israeli military released videos that it said showed a tunnel equipped with electric wiring, bathrooms, a kitchen and air-conditioned rooms. The infrastructure was intended to accommodate Hamas fighters, the military said.

Hamas said the group didn’t use Al-Shifa or other hospitals in Gaza for military purposes. A Hamas spokesman said Israel has besieged Gaza’s hospitals as part of an effort to break the will of Palestinians and push them off their land.

The stakes for Israel are high as it tries to maintain the support of allies, particularly the U.S., for its campaign to destroy Hamas. Its offensive has taken an increasingly devastating toll on the Palestinian population of Gaza, which is governed by Hamas—deemed a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel. More than 13,000 people have been killed, according to Gaza officials, whose figures don’t distinguish between militants and civilians.

While many security analysts agree the latest evidence Israel has released increasingly suggests a Hamas presence at the hospital, most say they have yet to see something that constitutes a smoking gun showing it was a command center for Hamas, as Israel has alleged.

Some security analysts said the videos released Wednesday were some of the strongest evidence that Israel has released to support its claims. The videos show a “significant level of Hamas-built headquarters in and under the Shifa hospital complex backing up Israel’s and U.S. intelligence claims,” said John Spencer, a retired U.S. Army officer and chair of urban warfare studies at the U.S. Military Academy.

Others remain skeptical of the Israeli military’s claims. “They have not shown anything to suggest Hamas was using those premises any time recently, much less using them for military purposes, much less using them as a command-and-control center,” said Paul R. Pillar, a nonresident senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security Studies.

Pressure has mounted in recent days as the human impact of the hospital seizure has become more apparent. Images of premature babies evacuated from Al-Shifa and taken to Egypt have been shared widely online and broadcast on television screens worldwide. On Sunday, after an inspection of the hospital, the United Nations called it a “death zone.”

Israeli military officials said they have created a safe route for those in Al-Shifa to evacuate. On Tuesday, about 700 people remained at the hospital, including patients, staff and people who were sheltering there, according to Gazan health authorities. The Palestine Red Crescent Society sent ambulances to evacuate more people on Wednesday.

Early Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to free 50 civilian hostages held by militants in Gaza in return for the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails and a four-day pause in fighting.

The evidence Israel ultimately presents could matter in terms of how its actions on the battlefield are viewed under the international laws governing warfare. Hospitals are protected under international law, but they can lose their special status when they are actively being used for hostile acts toward the enemy.

Israel is also competing in the court of public opinion and doing so in a world that is divided over the Gaza war. Every time Israel releases new material, some dismiss it as insufficient and others gobble it up as proof, particularly in Israel, said Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. Ultimately, its most important audience may be the U.S. or other Western allies. “Israel wants legitimacy in real time from the West,” she said.

Command center allegation

Although Israel has made allegations that Hamas used Al-Shifa for years, it began building a larger and more detailed public case about the hospital in late October, nearly three weeks before it seized the facility on Nov. 12.

Military officials put a 3-D animation on display in a briefing with reporters, showing Hamas avatars walking through a layered tunnel system underneath the hospital that was interspersed with what were described as command centers. It was a hypothetical illustration, however, not a real depiction of what was under the hospital, the Israeli military said.

Some of what Israel knows about Al-Shifa comes from its own work on the hospital. Israel renovated Al-Shifa decades ago when it occupied the Gaza Strip. Former Israeli officials have said those renovations included constructing underground floors to add sheltered accommodations for patients, a standard requirement for Israeli hospitals.

Hamas has connected those underground floors with tunnels that allow militants to move between them for command-and-control operations and to areas outside the hospital to mount attacks, said an Israeli military spokesman. A senior Israeli military official said Hamas’s underground infrastructure extended out into the vicinity of Al-Shifa as well.

After seizing the hospital, the Israeli military has been releasing its findings in batches. The Israeli military said it has done it that way, rather than waiting to do it all in one comprehensive presentation, in an effort to be transparent. Soldiers have to move slowly and methodically in their search to ensure that neither the soldiers nor the remaining patients and staff at the hospital are harmed by explosives Hamas may have left behind, the Israeli military and security experts said.

Weapons, equipment and a tunnel

On Nov. 15, the military first showed footage from the hospital’s MRI wing where it says it found AK-47s, grenades, military uniforms and a battle vest with the insignia of Hamas’s military wing. In a separate area, the military also said, soldiers found evidence of what the military described as a command-and-control center, pointing to several hand-held radios, a laptop and a stack of CD-ROMs.

Israel said its soldiers also found a Toyota pickup truck that was packed with weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades, explosives and Kalashnikov rifles. The vehicle model is similar to those used by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military said.

Security experts say some of Israel’s strongest evidence so far has come in recent days, when Israel released video that it said showed inside the tunnel and separate security footage that showed hostages being brought into the hospital on Oct. 7.

The video of the tunnel showed a shaft that the Israeli military said went 60 yards underground, leading into a vaulted cement-lined tunnel with electrical wiring. The Israeli military said the footage showed that the tunnel leads toward a metal blast door. The blast door also had a small hatch at its center, which the military said was a hole designed to fire weapons from the inside at attackers.

The Israeli military said the video released Wednesday showed what they found when they went beyond the blast door. The tunnel was similar to other ones built by Hamas, said Michael Horowitz, the head of intelligence at Le Beck International, a security and risk management consulting firm based in the Middle East.

“While the initial evidence released by the IDF was very limited, the recent evidence presented, including the tunnel inside the Al-Shifa compound, and the CCTV camera, are more significant,” said Horowitz, referring to the Israel Defense Forces, adding that he couldn’t detect any signs of tampering in the footage that had been released.

Hostages at the hospital

Israel also released security camera footage of what it said was a Nepalese and a Thai hostage being taken through the hospital hours after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. One video showed men dragging one of the hostages through a hallway, while another showed a hostage, with what appeared to be a severed leg, lying motionless on a stretcher under armed guard.

Many of the hostages needed medical care and were taken to hospitals throughout Gaza, the Hamas spokesman said, not just Al-Shifa. Israeli military officials said there were closer hospitals for Hamas fighters to take hostages while returning from their attack on Israel.

Days before releasing videos of the hostages, the Israeli military said it found the bodies of two other hostages at sites in the vicinity of the hospital. The military said a pathology report found one of the hostages was killed before being left behind. Weapons were also found next to the body, the military said.

“I think these pieces of evidence are starting to prove that Hamas used Al-Shifa as a base, though there needs to be more proof to show that this was in fact a command center,” said Horowitz.

The evidence Israel is presenting wouldn’t necessarily justify the suspension of Al-Shifa’s protected status under international law. The presence of hostages getting medical care, tunnels or trucks with weapons wouldn’t nullify its protected status, said Adil Haque, a professor at Rutgers University who focuses on the international law of armed conflict. What could lead to a hospital losing its special status is if hostages were being held captive there or if militants were using medical buildings to shield themselves from attack, he said.

But the stakes for Israel extend beyond international law. If Israeli intelligence made an incorrect assessment “this is beyond embarrassing,” said Yossi Mekelberg, a Middle East analyst at Chatham House, a think tank based in London. “It undermines their argument of the operation and they are left attacking hospitals on flimsy evidence.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
When Israel’s Great Nemesis Accepted Peace,2023-11-22T18:36:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Alex Rowell'],"With Israeli and Palestinian forces likely to resume hostilities after a four-day pause, the prospects for a more lasting peace in the Middle East remain dim. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to utterly defeat Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that governs the coastal enclave and stunned the world with its killing spree on Oct. 7. For their part, Hamas officials have said they will conduct similar attacks again, as many times as is necessary to achieve the complete destruction of Israel.

It is tempting to conclude that, after this, Israelis and Palestinians simply will never be able to agree on a political settlement capable of bringing an end to more than a century of conflict. Yet history is replete with examples of apparently implacable enemies tiring, eventually, of war and coming to the table—including in the Arab-Israeli context.

The late PLO leader Yasser Arafat, once seen by Israel as the arch-terrorist, signed the Oslo Accords with Israel’s Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1993, receiving a Nobel Peace Prize in consequence. Egypt’s President Anwar Sadat and Jordan’s King Hussein both led their countries to war against Israel before signing full peace treaties that have held to this day.

And before them all, there was the man who first set the precedent, for this as for so much else in Arab politics: Egypt’s President Gamal Abdel Nasser.

Like Hamas’s leaders today, and Arafat before them, Nasser was once regarded as the ultimate menace to Israel. The Jewish state’s first premier, David Ben-Gurion, loathed him and compared him to Hitler (much as Netanyahu now calls Hamas “the new Nazis”). In 1956, Ben-Gurion invaded Egypt in tandem with Britain and France—colonial powers aghast at Nasser’s nationalization of the Suez Canal Company—in an unsuccessful bid to topple Nasser by force.

Nasser’s survival of that onslaught made him a hero to millions of Arabs, not least to Palestinians, many of whom saw him as the man of destiny who would recover their lost homeland. It was Nasser who, in 1964, summoned the Arab heads of state to Egypt to approve the establishment of the PLO, whose declared aim was the liberation of all of historic Palestine from the Israeli state. Nasser provided the PLO with funding, training and equipment and hosted its main radio station, “The Voice of Palestine.”

Three years later, Nasser put Egypt on a war footing, expelling U.N. peacekeepers from his border with Israel and closing the Straits of Tiran to Israeli vessels, blockading Israel’s port of Eilat. “The Jews threaten war,” he said in a speech on May 22, 1967. “We tell them, ‘You’re most welcome. We’re ready for war.’” Four days later, he pledged that, in the event Israel were to attack Egypt, “The battle will be a comprehensive one and our main objective will be to destroy Israel.”

It was a calamitous misjudgment. Ten days later, Israeli bombers obliterated the Egyptian air force in a matter of hours. Over the course of six days, Israel routed not just the Egyptian but also the Syrian and Jordanian armies. In the process, it seized vast swaths of new territory, including the Gaza Strip (occupied until then by Egypt), the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan Heights and Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula.

The humiliating defeat prompted a sea change in Nasser’s position. In the war’s aftermath, Egypt approved U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which acknowledged Israel’s “sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence,” as well as its “right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.” The resolution also called on Israel to withdraw “from territories occupied in the recent conflict” and facilitate “a just settlement” of the Palestinian refugee issue. Establishing what became known as the “land-for-peace” formula, whereby Israel would return the land occupied in 1967 in exchange for peace with the Arab states, the resolution has been the basis of negotiations for a political settlement of the conflict ever since.

The PLO rejected Resolution 242, being unwilling at the time to recognize Israeli sovereignty of any kind. This marked a rift between Nasser and the Palestinians, which widened in 1970, when Nasser reiterated his support for a two-state solution, publicly endorsing a proposal by President Nixon’s secretary of state, William P. Rogers, to cease hostilities with Israel and resume peace talks in line with Resolution 242. “We have declared before the whole world that we seek peace,” proclaimed Nasser on July 24, 1970.

This time, Nasser was openly denounced by several PLO factions, who staged turbulent street protests outside Egyptian embassies in Lebanon and Jordan, in which Nasser was branded a traitor, “coward” and “agent of imperialism.” The furious Nasser responded by closing two PLO radio stations in Cairo that had broadcast stinging criticisms of his policy. He also suspended the funding and equipping of militants in Gaza.

The breach polarized the Arab world, with rejectionist states such as Iraq and Algeria backing the Palestinian position, while the likes of Jordan, Lebanon and Sudan sided with Nasser. The man who had lived for so many years as the iconic symbol of Arab revolution would end his days condemned by his own disciples as a sellout. Two months later, the 52-year-old Nasser died of a heart attack.

Looking back on this episode today, it is striking to reflect how far opinions have moved away from centrist positions to what were once fringe views. While even Nasser could once endorse a two-state solution—and a peace initiative proposed by a Republican administration in Washington—it is de rigueur today in many pro-Palestine circles and among the hard-liners who populate Netanyahu’s cabinet to reject the two-state formula as unworkable, undesirable or both.

To be sure, several factors complicate any comparison between Nasser’s time and our own. One is the construction of hundreds of Israeli settlements, housing some 700,000 people, in the Palestinian West Bank since Israel’s occupation began in 1967, which has done much to undermine the feasibility of a Palestinian state. Another is Hamas’s uncompromising Islamist ideology, which differs in important respects from Nasser’s self-styled “Arab socialism.” (Indeed, Nasser vigorously repressed Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, of which Hamas is a Palestinian offshoot.) Where Nasser, Arafat, Sadat and Hussein were all ideologically agile, moving with the winds and changing with the times, the same can hardly be said of Hamas, especially after Oct. 7.

Is it conceivable, nonetheless, that some yet-unseen future iteration of Hamas—assuming it survives the current war—might, in the fullness of time, seek a settlement? It is nearly impossible to imagine today, but it was also once nearly impossible to imagine of Nasser and Arafat. In the end, as Rabin said, one makes peace with one’s enemies, not with one’s friends.

And that, above all, must be the outcome sought most urgently by responsible actors and stakeholders in Israel-Palestine today—with or without Hamas. If there is one lesson that can be drawn with very high confidence from history, it is that military action alone can bring neither security to Israelis nor liberation to Palestinians. Both Hamas and Israel’s own extremists live and breathe to sabotage all meaningful efforts toward a just and sustainable political resolution of this conflict. It is precisely for that reason that the rest of us must redouble our resolve to achieve it.

Israel’s Hospital Strategy and Human Rights,2023-11-21T18:24:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"A Palestinian medic cares for premature babies evacuated from Al Shifa hospital to a hospital in Rafah, Gaza, Nov. 20. Photo: said khatib/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images

Your editorial “The Battle of Al Shifa Hospital” (Nov. 15) describes the special protections hospitals are due during armed conflicts and concludes that Israel met the requirements in its operations around Gaza’s Al Shifa hospital. But wrongful use by one side does not justify abuses by the other, including attacks likely to cause harm to civilians that are disproportionate to any expected military gain.

At the four attacked hospitals that Human Rights Watch closely examined, which did not include Al Shifa, the Israeli government had not provided evidence that justified the mass removal of patients and doctors and the shutdown of already-overwhelmed hospitals. Because of the hostilities, these hospitals lacked water and electricity and had dwindling medical supplies due in part to Israel’s blockade of Gaza."
China Steps Up Support for Palestinian Cause in Challenge to U.S. Mideast Policy,2023-11-21T12:30:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Chun Han Wong'],"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi shakes hands with Riyad al-Maliki, the foreign minister for the Palestinian Authority, in a red tie, at a meeting in Beijing on Monday.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping is seizing on the conflict in Gaza to portray his country as a force for stability in the Muslim world, in contrast with what Beijing casts as American meddling in the Middle East.

In recent weeks, China has ramped up its appeals to halt the Israel-Gaza war, a show of diplomatic bustle laden with humanitarian platitudes but light on substantive proposals for achieving a cease-fire.

China’s foreign minister on Monday hosted top diplomats from Arab and Muslim-majority countries in Beijing to discuss ways to mediate peace, building on efforts by Beijing’s Middle East envoy, who shuttled across the region this month to pledge Chinese support for talks to end the fighting in Gaza.

Xi has weighed in as well. Fresh from his San Francisco summit with President Biden last week, the Chinese leader discussed the Israel-Hamas conflict with French President Emmanuel Macron in a Monday phone call, before joining fellow leaders from the Brics bloc of emerging economies for a videoconference on the war on Tuesday.

Xi agreed with Macron that “the ‘two-state solution’ is the fundamental way to resolve the cycle of Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s readout of the Monday call.

In a Tuesday speech to fellow Brics leaders, Xi called on Israel to cease its blockade and “collective punishment” on people of Gaza, and restated China’s appeals for an independent Palestinian state. The fundamental reason for the current situation is that “the Palestinian people’s rights to statehood, survival and return have been ignored for a long time,” Xi said. “Without a fair solution to the Palestinian issue, there can be no lasting peace and stability in the Middle East.”

Among other Brics members, Russia, Brazil and South Africa have been vocal in their criticism of Israel’s military operations in Gaza and accused Israeli forces of committing rights violations.

China’s burst of diplomacy around Gaza is meant more to boost its image as a responsible global power than deliver substantive progress in resolving the decadeslong conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, experts on Chinese foreign policy said.

“The Chinese do not bear the illusion that they can create a solution that no one thought of before,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank. “If solving the issue is unlikely, then it is more important for China to be present at the table, to play an active role, and to claim leadership when possible.”

Under Xi, China has leaned more forcefully into its self-styled status as a champion of peace and humanitarian values, often in contrast with what Beijing criticizes as U.S. warmongering in global hot spots. Since Hamas launched the Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel that sparked the war, Chinese officials have repeatedly urged an immediate cease-fire and voiced support for Palestinian statehood, while state media accused Washington of pro-Israel bias and meddling in the Middle East.

The U.S., while committed to helping Israel defeat Hamas, has been pressing for Israeli restraint, including calls to minimize civilian casualties and allow a pause in the fighting to get humanitarian aid to people in Gaza.

Beijing has sharpened its focus on the Muslim world in recent years, stepping up engagement with Middle Eastern and other powers as it sought to temper criticism of the Communist Party’s efforts to forcibly assimilate Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang. It also notably brokered a detente between Saudi Arabia and Iran this past spring.

Chinese diplomats are now tapping these gains as they try to mediate in the Israel-Gaza conflict.

On Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired a meeting in Beijing with visiting foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia and the Palestinian National Authority, as well as the secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the world’s largest grouping of Muslim nations.

“China is a good friend and brother of Arab and Islamic countries,” said Wang, who restated Beijing’s willingness to work with partners in the Muslim world to end the Israel-Gaza war and forge a lasting peace. “Israel should stop the collective punishment of the people of Gaza and open a humanitarian corridor as soon as possible to prevent a wider humanitarian disaster,” Wang was quoted as saying in the Chinese readout.

The visiting foreign ministers said Arab and Islamic countries hope to work more closely with China to restart peace talks and promote the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the basis of the two-state solution, according to the Chinese readout.

The Beijing confab came after China’s special envoy on the Middle East, Zhai Jun, pressed his government’s peacemaking messages in meetings around the region in recent weeks, most recently at last week’s Manama Dialogue, an annual security forum in Bahrain.

China has avoided directly condemning Hamas for its Oct. 7 attacks while issuing broad denunciations of violence against civilians—in contrast with Washington’s preference for censuring Hamas in diplomatic statements about Gaza, including at the United Nations.

At a U.N. Security Council meeting last week, China backed a resolution calling for “humanitarian pauses and corridors through the Gaza Strip to facilitate the provision of essential goods and services,” which the council approved. Beijing’s representative at the meeting also expressed concern over the siege of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, which Israel said was being used for operations by Hamas militants, and urged Israel to cease military operations against civilian facilities.

China is aligning itself with pro-Palestinian constituencies, as well as anti-Israel and anti-U.S. voices in the Middle East and elsewhere, said Enrico Fardella, a professor at the University of Naples ‘L’Orientale’ and director of the ChinaMed Project, which studies Beijing’s influence in the wider Mediterranean region.

The goal is “to maximize the gains for Beijing’s international status at minimum cost,” by “showing the superiority of its own diplomatic action in the face of the Americans’ one-sided and pro-Israel position,” he said.

Beijing’s perceived partiality toward the Palestinians and limited leverage over Israel, however, would likely curtail its ability to shape a speedy resolution to the war, some experts say.

“Siding with Palestine is not going to contribute to the solution of the issue, and it does not project an image of neutrality,” said Sun at the Stimson Center. “It’s similar to the Ukraine war—while China thinks it is being fair and neutral, people see it as pro-Russia.”

Israel meanwhile has pressed ahead with its military campaign in Gaza, where Israeli forces have largely taken control of the northern parts of the territory and are shifting the focus of their operations to southern Gaza.

While Beijing can exert some influence in Middle East affairs, thanks to its ties with Iran, its “power to shape events in the region is quite limited,” said Nurettin Akçay, a guest researcher at Shanghai University who has studied China-Middle East relations. “The ongoing crisis has presented certain opportunities for China, but it has also underscored the reality that China lacks the required hard power to pursue its objectives.”

Gaza Is Gen Z’s First Real War,2023-11-20T23:10:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Walter Russell Mead'],"Is Israel’s war with Hamas a war crime? At a recent (entirely civil and non-confrontational) event at Bard College, a student suggested that this was the case. After all, there have been at least 11,000 casualties since the Oct. 7 terror attack that launched the war, and the majority dead have been civilians. Thousands were children. How, the Bard students and many of their peers around the country and the world ask, could all this not be a war crime? And even if Hamas’s initial attack was itself a war crime and not a “legitimate act of resistance against an occupying power,” isn’t the larger loss of civilian life in Israel’s subsequent attacks just as bad?

I could have turned the session into a debate about the underlying merits of the Palestinian and Israeli causes or a technical discussion of the laws of war. Instead, being a professor, I turned the discussion to the history of war. One night in March 1945, U.S. planes dropped incendiary bombs over Tokyo killing tens of thousands of Japanese civilians. Incomplete estimates from Japan put the total death toll from allied bombing raids as high as 500,000. All told, there were an estimated 38 million civilian deaths in World War II, more than twice the approximately 15 million deaths of soldiers in combat.

As for the treatment of enemy civilians, at the 1945 Potsdam Conference the U.S. agreed to the forcible removal of about 12 million Germans, again largely civilian and many children and elderly, from lands their ancestors had inhabited for centuries. Many of the expulsions took place in winter amid terrible scenes of hunger and deprivation, all while mass rapes of German women slowly subsided across the Soviet zone of Germany.

Lawyers and legislators can debate whether these actions constitute war crimes, but as Cicero put it more than two thousand years ago, “inter arma enim silent leges.” Roughly, that translates as the “laws go silent when armies clash.” Or as William Tecumseh Sherman put it more succinctly, “War is hell.”

One reason the news from Gaza has so massively affected the younger generation is that they have grown up considering peace to be normal and natural. The war in Gaza hasn’t merely introduced young Americans to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It also has shown them the face of war.

After the horrors of World War II, Americans did everything to build a stable and at least relatively peaceful world order. This order was far from perfect. It tolerated and, in some cases, protected gross economic, social, racial and national injustices. And some of the little wars Americans fought to defend it, as policy makers at the time believed, were as brutal as the world wars of the 20th century.

But the world order prevented the eruption of global conflicts on the scale of the great wars with casualties reckoned by the tens of millions. It also permitted generations of Americans to grow up in a bubble. For younger generations, war was passé. Foreign policy henceforth would involve promoting equitable development in poor countries, extending the definition of human rights, promoting global public health, fighting climate change and perfecting the body of international law.

War has other ideas. The American-led world order is under attack abroad, even as Americans have increasingly abandoned their commitment to preserving it. The result, inevitably, is a gradual and perhaps sudden return to the lawlessness and violence that marks a world at war.

Israelis and Palestinians don’t live in the post-historical bubble. More than 300,000 Syrian civilians are believed to have been killed during a decade of civil war, and millions more have been driven from their homes. Elsewhere, an estimated 100,000 Armenians fled their homes in terror this year. Roughly six million Sudanese have done so in the current civil war. Industrial-scale slaughters of the innocent, and the flight of millions of refugees are the new normal in their neighborhood. Jihadi bands and Wagner mercenaries are sowing chaos and death across the Sahel. About 370,000 have died in the Yemen war.

Gaza introduced Gen Z to the true horror of war. In the short run, Hamas’s propaganda machine is enlisting images of suffering Palestinians to foil Israeli efforts to break its power in Gaza.

The real question, though, for the future of America and the world isn’t whether hot-headed college students will march for Hamas. It’s whether as they mature, they come to understand how fragile and important peace is and take up the task of defending it. If not, war won’t be something they see on cellphones and spout slogans about. It will be the force that shapes and determines their lives.

My School Doesn’t Tolerate Anti-Semitism,2023-11-20T22:20:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['James S. Robbins'],"America’s elite colleges and universities are soft on terrorism and strong on anti-Semitism. Who knew?

Weak-kneed responses by academic leaders to Hamas’s attack on Israel, coupled with soaring anti-Semitism on campuses, have created a crisis. Jewish students are increasingly unsafe, while major donors are alarmed by the harmful ideas promoted by the institutions they support.

The implicit bargain in higher education is that donors support schools as an expression of good citizenship, and it’s up to the schools to produce good citizens. This bargain has frayed in recent years as schools aren’t holding up their end of the deal.

Many campuses have become echo chambers that lack intellectual diversity and promote a climate of intolerance. To avoid being “canceled” by progressives, moderate and conservative students and faculty practice self-censorship rather than discuss controversial ideas.

The response to the Oct. 7 attack exposed how schools have become incubators of radicalism. Protests, vandalism, intimidation, and assaults—mostly targeting Jewish students—are the fruits of the critical-theory educational model that stigmatizes Jews as “white oppressors” and Israelis as “Zionist colonizers.” In response to anti-Semitism, university administrators have either done nothing or issued anodyne statements deploring violence in general terms, until some were badgered into reacting more explicitly.

Many donors saw the jarring response from the academy as a betrayal of their generosity and deeply held values. Now they are voting with their feet and wallets: withdrawing or canceling donations, resigning from boards, and encouraging alumni to boycott their alma maters.

Some schools set a higher standard. As the academic dean at the Institute of World Politics—a private graduate school in Washington—I have had no problem calling out Hamas for its genocidal actions. My academic and professional background is in counterterrorism, and I served for a decade in the Defense Department’s professional military education programs. Other scholar-practitioners at IWP have analyzed or operated against adversaries in Russia, Iran, Latin America, East Asia and elsewhere. We bring our real-world experience to the classroom, and we encourage intellectual inquiry, debate, and diversity.

Donors frustrated with schools in thrall to progressivism but who still want to support education should shop around for a better fit. IWP is one of many smaller, private schools where uncensored debate, critical thinking, and respect for Western civilization still thrive. Schools with values-based undergraduate programs such as High Point University, Belmont Abbey College, Grove City College, Elon University, Hillsdale College and Liberty University don’t tolerate the outrageous behavior we have seen at establishment schools.

Donors who reject Western civilization and would like to see Israel erased, by contrast, can always give to the Ivy League.

"For Postwar Gaza, Differences Grow Over Palestinian Leadership Role",2023-11-19T04:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Benoit Faucon', 'William Mauldin', 'Summer Said', 'Rory Jones']","RAMALLAH, West Bank—As Western and Arab leaders look beyond Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip, most agree they want some form of Palestinian government running the enclave, but they can’t agree on who it should include.

One emerging point of consensus is that the Palestinian Authority—as it now operates and oversees the West Bank—isn’t up to the job. But there is no easy alternative.

Discussions in Washington, Jerusalem and elsewhere in the Middle East are focused on reforming the authority or pushing it aside for something better to govern roughly 2.2 million Gazans upended by a devastating war.

Israel has said it doesn’t want to govern the strip once its offensive ends, potentially months from now, but wants to maintain security to ensure Gaza isn’t used to attack Israelis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has said he opposes the Palestinian Authority in its current form governing there.

The authority’s 88-year-old leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has said he would return to Gaza only as part of broader Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations toward a two-state solution. Yet few envisage a quick peace agreement so soon after the Oct. 7 attacks by militant group Hamas that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, prompting Israel’s assault on Gaza in response.

Brett McGurk, the White House’s top Middle East official, and Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, visited Brussels and the Middle East in recent days, seeking a coordinated approach to the conflict. The U.S. and its allies are unsure whether they can transform the authority or find another solution before Israel finishes its military operation against Hamas.

“Everyone sees the problems,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a former official in the Palestinian Authority now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “No one seems to have a good idea what to do about it.”

The U.S. and European countries agree on what they don’t want. They reject displacing Palestinians from Gaza in the long term, Israel reoccupying the area, or Hamas returning in a way that threatens Israel. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Gaza and the West Bank should be unified under the Palestinian Authority.

Palestinian Authority officials told EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Friday that it can help govern Gaza, using thousands of its own civil servants.

Complicating the situation is a view from some Arab states, such as Egypt, which believe Hamas should play a role in Palestinian politics—a prospect Israel and many Western countries oppose. The Arab leaders argue that while Israel might be able to destroy Hamas’s military capabilities in Gaza, it won’t eliminate the group as a political movement, and Hamas leaders must be engaged to promote stability.

Israel also still faces the challenge of defeating Hamas’s military, which isn’t a foregone conclusion. The Israeli military has largely taken control of northern Gaza above ground, but Hamas militants remain fortified in a tunnel network and hold hostages, complicating the offensive’s next stage.

For now, Abbas is focused more on pushing for a cease-fire than what comes next. In a meeting with McGurk and Leaf this week, the Palestinian leader asked the U.S. to pressure Israel to halt the continuing war in Gaza, accelerate deliveries of humanitarian aid and halt assaults by settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to Mahmoud Habbash, an adviser to Abbas.

Blinken on Friday asked Israel to take urgent steps to stop violence being carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.

As a compromise, U.S. officials have suggested publicly in recent weeks that an international force, with troops from neighboring Arab allies, could enter Gaza. Some Israelis also embrace the idea, arguing the Palestinian Authority hasn’t proven to be a good partner for promoting long-term peace with Israel.

Officials from Germany and some other European countries have also suggested a role for a United Nations peacekeeping force or a U.N.-mandated presence to help with governance and security.

Still, when Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi met with Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns on Nov. 7, he rejected a proposal for the North African country to manage security in the Gaza Strip until the Palestinian Authority can take over after Hamas’s defeat, according to senior Egyptian officials.

The Egyptian president said his government wouldn’t play a role in eliminating Hamas, as Egypt needs the militant group to help maintain security at the country’s border with the Gaza Strip. No other Arab country has suggested it would be willing to help manage security in Gaza.

“There will be no Arab troops going to Gaza. None. We’re not going to be seen as the enemy,” Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said at a security conference in Bahrain on Saturday.

The Palestinian Authority, too, has said it would oppose an international force, and some Israeli security officials have warned that such an arrangement wouldn’t work, pointing to a United Nations peacekeeping mission on its border with Lebanon that has watched as Hezbollah and Palestinian militias have regularly exchanged fire with Israel.

An Israeli military official said the Palestinian Authority was also nowhere near the level of competence in maintaining security that Israel would require to prevent another attack out of Gaza. Even those who have served in the Palestinian Authority say it is ill-equipped to run the Palestinian enclave, and is unpopular.

“Even if the PA sought that role, it would be unable to perform it, especially given that its already-diminished legitimacy is fast vanishing under the pressure of the continuing war,” said Salam Fayyad, who was the authority’s prime minister for six years until 2013.

The Palestinian Authority under Abbas is based in a relatively quiet compound in Ramallah, in the West Bank, and guarded by security forces with red berets and rifles. It was formed in 1994 after the Palestine Liberation Organization, under longstanding leader Yasser Arafat, sealed a peace accord with Israel that gave Palestinians self-rule in parts of the West Bank and Gaza.

The PLO at the time was dominated by a Palestinian political faction, Fatah, which helped set up the authority to govern on an interim basis. The PLO had to shift overnight from being a political movement based outside the Palestinian territories to a government providing education, healthcare and other services to millions.

The first years of its rule were marred by corruption and violence by Hamas, a rival faction that aimed to disrupt the peace process. At the same time, Israel expanded Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the army limited Palestinian freedom of movement.

Failed peace talks in 2000 helped spark a Palestinian uprising that made Israelis wary of a long-term peace agreement. Israel walled off the West Bank and, in 2005, dismantled Jewish settlements in Gaza.

Two years later, Hamas fought Fatah for the enclave, taking over control, but the authority continued to direct a large part of its budget for civil servants in Gaza.

Since then, Palestinian officials have accused Netanyahu—in power during most of the period since 2009—of boosting Hamas in Gaza at the expense of the authority to divide the Palestinian leadership, make a peace deal harder and appease Israel’s right wing, which doesn’t want to cede the West Bank in a future agreement.

Netanyahu has said the Palestinian Authority can’t be considered a partner for peace because, while it recognizes Israel, the Israeli government says it promotes incitement against its citizens and pays the families of prisoners detained for terrorism offenses.

This month, the authority was unable to pay its security forces after Israel blocked the transfer of close to $200 million in Palestinian tax payments, said General Talal Dweikat, a commander in the force.

“Netanyahu has made a deliberate effort to weaken the PA from a security perspective,” said Dweikat. “It is becoming very difficult to maintain law and order.”

The U.S. is now pressing Israel to unfreeze the money, according to Western officials. A State Department spokesperson said that “this is Palestinian money. The secretary made clear that those revenues, those funds, ought to be released to the Palestinian people.”

The authority’s standing also has been tainted among Palestinians by its cooperation with Israel on security in the West Bank. Ahead of the war, Abbas’s approval rating among Palestinians was at about 20% and has likely fallen further, said Khalil Shikaki, head of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.

He estimates the only way the Palestinian Authority can return to Gaza is to extract concessions from Israel, such as movement toward a Palestinian state, which Israelis are currently unwilling to accept.

“Israel will find essentially no one willing to step in to replace the Israeli army, including the Palestinian Authority,” Shikaki said. “In the short term…Israel will have no choice but to run the affairs of 2.2 million Palestinians living in Gaza. I can’t see any other alternative.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Israel-Hamas War Puts Palestinians Back on Arab World’s Agenda,2023-11-18T04:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Stephen Kalin', 'Omar Abdel-Baqui']","AMMAN, Jordan—Israel’s fierce response to last month’s cross-border assault by Hamas militants from Gaza has reinvigorated support for Palestinians in the Arab world and stirred popular anger—not just at Israel and its biggest ally, the U.S., but also at Arab governments.

Some in the Arab and wider Muslim world joined global condemnations of Hamas, which carried out attacks on a music festival and agricultural communities in southern Israel. Authorities there say 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were kidnapped and taken to Gaza.

But as the death toll from Israeli airstrikes and ground operations has climbed, surpassing 12,000, according to health authorities in the Hamas-controlled enclave, Arab television and social media have been blanketed with images of suffering and destruction in Gaza.

There is little in the way of public-opinion polling on the Arab reaction. But from Jordan to Oman and Egypt to Morocco, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in weekly protests to express support for the Palestinians and call for a cease-fire. They are also demanding their governments abrogate agreements with Israel and are in some cases cheering for Hamas.

Despite the public pressure, Arab states haven’t taken strong action against Israel and they are unlikely to do so, as those in power look to maintain stability and preserve relations with the U.S., analysts say.

“For me, what’s happening in Gaza calls for a response from the entire Arab world,” said Najah al-Atoom, a retired schoolteacher in Jordan who says she spends hours monitoring developments in Gaza on social media. “The position of our governments is shameful.”

Some pro-Palestinian protesters in Egypt last month shouted the slogan “Bread, freedom and social justice” that galvanized the 2011 Arab Spring and led to the removal of the country’s longtime dictator. Security forces arrested dozens of demonstrators and cracked down on subsequent rallies.

In Morocco, hundreds of thousands of people have hit the streets to support the Palestinian cause, organizers say, but also to criticize their own government’s relations with Israel.

“We’re at a very sensitive and extremely dangerous phase,” said Jordanian political analyst Osama Al Sharif. “We don’t know what kind of reaction we’re going to face, especially with these regimes feeling the pressure that they have abandoned the Palestinians.”

Roughly 720,000 Palestinians were displaced amid Israel’s 1948 founding, which was followed by rounds of armed conflict with Arab states. In recent decades, many of these states have made peace with Israel and deepened ties even as little progress has been made toward a political settlement between Israelis and Palestinians.

Morocco, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and later Sudan normalized relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords brokered under the Trump administration, opening the door for business and security cooperation. Egypt and Jordan, both of which have strong U.S. relations, have had diplomatic ties with Israel since 1979 and 1994, respectively.

In the months before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Israel and Saudi Arabia were engaged in U.S.-brokered negotiations aimed at Riyadh recognizing Israel in exchange for American security guarantees and assistance setting up a nuclear program.

“The scenes we’re seeing from Gaza destroy everything that Israel built over the last three decades in terms of peace and regional integration,” said a senior Arab official.

The Saudi talks are now on hold. The kingdom has condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza, Bahrain suspended economic ties with Israel, and Turkey has recalled its ambassador, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan branding Israel a “terror state.”

Jordanian lawmakers agreed this week to review agreements with Israel, including its 1994 peace treaty and a $10 billion gas deal. In Tunisia, Parliament is discussing criminalizing contacts with Israel including by normal citizens.

But such moves are unlikely to advance without support from the countries’ leaders. Even Iran, Hamas’s most prominent backer, has lent little more than moral support to Hamas since the attacks, though the U.S. and Israel say Iran helped facilitate the assault with training, funding and other aid.

Hamas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, represents an Islamist nationalist movement that Arab governments like Egypt, Jordan and those in the Gulf find dangerous.

Jordanian security forces have tolerated protesters waving Hamas flags and chanting slogans in favor of the militants, while preventing them from approaching the Israeli Embassy in Amman or marching toward the border with Israel.

Arab officials say they worry that the longer the conflict drags on, the harder it will be to contain domestic unrest. Protests have resulted in violent confrontations between protesters and police in Jordan, Egypt and Turkey.

Anwar Gargash, a diplomatic adviser to the U.A.E., said Saturday that what he called moderate Arab countries must “stand up to extremism and radicalism” to confront “an onslaught within Arab public opinion” resulting from the war.

“We have to take charge because for us there is a fundamental attack” on the stances of countries such as the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, he said at a security conference in Bahrain.

Leaders in the region see a risk of resurgent global terrorism and say it could also lead to broader protests about domestic issues like poverty, jobs and security-state abuses of the type that led to the Arab Spring. A decade after uprisings caused several governments to topple, the Middle East and North Africa remain largely run by authoritarian governments that haven’t addressed those core concerns.

“Don’t rule out a scenario of a new wave of Arab Spring, and that may include a lot of countries,” said Oraib Rantawi, director of the Amman-based Al Quds Center for Political Studies.

Moroccans were largely against normalization before a 2020 deal to establish relations with Israel, with over 88% saying they opposed the idea, according to the research institute Arab Center Washington DC. Morocco, a monarchy that restricts free speech, went ahead with normalization in exchange for recognition of its sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara, access to Israeli intelligence technology and getting into Washington’s good graces.

Before the U.A.E. normalized relations with Israel, most of its citizens opposed working with Israel, according to a poll commissioned by the think thank Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Months after a normalization deal was struck in 2020, the population became roughly evenly split on the issue but in the years since more people have cooled to the idea, subsequent polls showed.

Polling in Bahrain, which normalized relations with Israel the same year, showed a roughly even split.

Sion Assidon, an organizer in the Moroccan Front to Support Palestine and Against Normalization, said that before the war, police harassed protesters or prevented them from joining antinormalization marches.

“Now, it’s impossible to stop us. There are so many of us,” said Assidon, a former political prisoner of Jewish-Moroccan descent. “The police are opening big avenues and hear us chanting that ‘normalization is complicity.’ We protest in front of Parliament and government buildings.”

He said the government brands itself internally as pro-Palestinian even as it brokers military and intelligence agreements with Israel. “It’s a contradiction,” he said. “They need to manage it.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
California Wants to Ban Your Choo-Choo,2023-11-17T23:33:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['The Editorial Board'],"Gavin Newsom wants to be President, but in some respects the Governor already is, as the Biden Administration lets California impose its climate rules on the other 49 states. In the latest example, the Environmental Protection Agency has green-lighted Sacramento’s plan to outlaw diesel locomotives.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) in April approved a regulation that would require railroads to replace diesel with “zero emission” locomotives. Diesel locomotives typically have a useful life of 40 years or more, but the regulation would bar those that are 23-years or older from running in the state after 2029.

Passenger locomotives made in 2030 or later would be required to “operate in a ZE [zero-emission] configuration” in California. By 2035 new locomotive engines for long-haul freight trains would also have to be ZE. Railroads don’t switch locomotives when they cross state lines, so California’s mandate would cover trains nationwide.

CARB’s plan dovetails with its ban on internal combustion engines in cars and heavy-duty trucks. Aside from their high cost, EVs have a limited battery range and extended charging time. Zero-emission battery-powered locomotives will have the same problems—if and when they are brought to market.

Corp. recently unveiled the world’s first battery-powered, heavy-haul locomotive for mainline service, which would operate like a hybrid car. It would recharge its battery through regenerative braking and could also tap diesel engines for fuel. But a freight train entirely powered by batteries is still a dream.

Replacing diesel fuel with batteries in long-haul trains is impractical because of their enormous weight and size. Battery components can also overheat and cause explosions that release toxic gas.

’s East Palestine derailment last winter would have been worse had the trains been powered by batteries.

Even if the technology for zero-emission locomotives eventually arrives, railroads will have to test them over many years to guarantee their safety. CARB tacitly acknowledges this by requiring railroads to set aside billions of dollars each year to finance future purchases of zero-emission locomotives.

BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad estimate that each railroad will have to deposit $700 million to $800 million a year in a special spending account. These costs will be passed on to customers nationwide, meaning retailers, farmers and other businesses.

The railroad lobby has filed a lawsuit challenging CARB’s diesel locomotive ban, arguing that the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act pre-empts state and local regulations that have the effect of managing rail transportation. The Clean Air Act also expressly prohibits states from setting emissions standards for new locomotives.

CARB conceded in 2005 that state regulations “designed to reduce emissions from railroad locomotives” or “affect how the railroads are permitted to use and operate [their] locomotives” were likely pre-empted by federal law. But the EPA this month finalized a rule that would let California apply for a federal waiver to regulate non-new locomotives. EPA says the Clean Air Act’s bar on state regulation of new locomotives means California can still regulate older locomotives in operation. That’s highly questionable. But even if it’s true, CARB is regulating new locomotives by requiring all engines built in 2035 or later to be configured to produce zero emissions.

Even as California’s climate goals prove to be unattainable and costly, its progressive regulators charge ahead while the Biden Administration removes the brakes.

Hamas’s Barbarity Heightens the Crisis in Higher Education,2023-11-17T22:04:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Michael R. Bloomberg'],"The barbaric attack by Hamas against Israel—the intentional slaughter of defenseless civilians, including children and babies, and the taking of hostages—should have been a unifying moment for America. Shamefully, it has become something else: a wake-up call about a crisis in higher education.

It has been painful to watch students at elite colleges implicitly or explicitly endorse Hamas’s attack. They aren’t old enough to remember 9/11, and it’s clear they never learned its lesson: Intentionally targeting civilians for slaughter is inexcusable no matter the political circumstances.

For Americans, this isn’t a matter of defending Israel but of defending our nation’s most sacred values. One can support the Palestinian people and still denounce the intentional slaughter of civilians.

Why have so many students failed to do so? The answer begins where the buck stops—with college presidents. For years, they have allowed their campuses to become bastions of intolerance, by permitting students to shout down the voices of others. They have condoned “trigger warnings” that shield students from difficult ideas. They have refused to defend faculty who run afoul of student sentiment. And they have created “safe spaces” that discourage or exclude opposing views.

College presidents have also allowed campuses to become institutions of conformity. In a 2014 commencement speech at Harvard, I warned that many of America’s top colleges had become Soviet-like in their lack of viewpoint diversity. As I noted, 96% of donations from Ivy League faculty and staff in the 2012 presidential election went to Barack Obama, while only 4% went to another Harvard alumnus, Mitt Romney.

Over the past decade, this combination of campus conformity and intolerance has only gotten worse. It is no surprise that support for terrorism, dressed in the language of social justice, has emerged from this environment. The road to tyranny and genocide lies in refusing to countenance a challenge to one’s definition of justice and pursuit of it. That is precisely the culture universities have been coddling if not cultivating, and they are now reaping what they have sown.

When students haven’t been taught to engage in constructive argument and debate, they default to slogans and slurs. As this has happened, it’s fair for students to wonder why schools that issue trigger warnings for classic novels allow groups to scream for intifada.

Similarly, the public has wondered why some college presidents who were quick to condemn the murder of George Floyd were slow to condemn the murder of 1,200 Israeli citizens. Others might wonder why the presidents issued no statements on Sudan’s civil war or the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Instead of issuing statements on selective issues, college presidents should adopt the policy the University of Chicago has stuck to since 1967, when it declared: “The university is the home and sponsor of critics; it is not itself the critic.” Only a few other universities, including North Carolina and Vanderbilt, have adopted this policy.

I understand why some donors are angry with college presidents who failed to condemn Hamas, but the best response isn’t to demand that presidents issue more or stronger statements. We should demand that they stop making them altogether. Let students and faculty freely debate issues on their own, even when speech makes people uncomfortable.

To be clear, no student should ever feel physically intimidated or unsafe going to or speaking in class, as many Jewish students have lately. Students who wish to hurl epithets and reveal their bigotry should be able to do so, but they can’t throw rocks. They can chant slogans, exposing their inability to communicate in ways that college students should be capable of, but they can’t issue violent threats or disrupt others’ studies. Any student who runs afoul of those basic principles should be thrown out of school, and any outsider who does so should be removed from campus. That is the obligation college presidents owe matriculating students.

As part of addressing this crisis in higher education, presidents and deans should make a priority of hiring faculty with greater viewpoint diversity to teach students how to engage in civil discourse, while challenging and expanding their minds. Professors may resist, but administrators must make clear that such diversity is a requirement of academic freedom.

Trustees have a crucial role to play in holding presidents accountable for this work. Running a school and managing professors is difficult and complex, as administrators well know, but organizational complexity can’t be an excuse for faculty conformity.

The bigotry infecting campuses will spread until college presidents directly address its causes and their own role in fostering them. If not now—as students cheer the intentional slaughter of civilians—when?

"Several Schools Under Investigation for Allegedly Failing to Protect Jewish, Muslim Students",2023-11-17T20:38:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Joseph Pisani'],"The University of Pennsylvania is under investigation for alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

The Education Department is investigating several schools over reports of harassment against Jewish and Muslim students in response to ongoing campus tensions related to the Israel-Hamas war.

The department is investigating Columbia University, Cornell University, the University of Pennsylvania, Wellesley College, Lafayette College, the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, and the Maize Unified School District in Kansas. The schools are under investigation for alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which protects students from, among other things, discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics.

College campuses have become a hotbed for tension following Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, with protests often drawing national attention. Jewish and Muslim advocacy groups have reported more harassment, intimidation and assaults around the country since the attack. The surge of threats has fueled widespread calls for schools to keep students on both sides of the conflict safe.

The Education Department said five of the complaints allege antisemitic harassment and two allege harassment against Muslims. It declined to provide further details.

Schools that don’t protect students from discrimination and refuse recommendations from the Education Department’s civil rights office could lose federal funding, the department said.

“Hate has no place in our schools, period,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement Thursday.

The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, a Jewish advocacy group, filed complaints to the Education Department against Penn and Wellesley last week, alleging the schools didn’t do enough to protect Jewish students from antisemitism. The Brandeis Center said schools should provide mandatory training on antisemitism to staff and update their policies on antisemitism, among other remedies.

“The swift responses to our complaints reaffirm how severe the antisemitism crisis is on college campuses and sends an important signal to university leaders,” said Kenneth Marcus, the Brandeis Center’s founder and chairman.

Penn and Wellesley said they have taken steps to combat antisemitism on campus. Columbia declined to comment on the investigation. Cooper Union, based in New York City, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Lafayette College, in Easton, Pa., said it doesn’t know why it was included in the department’s investigation, but that it would cooperate. Maize Unified School District, which oversees K-12 schools in Maize, Kan., also said it would cooperate.

Schools have struggled to navigate the national scrutiny brought on by campus protests. Penn and other elite institutions, including Harvard University, have faced pressure from billionaire donors threatening to cut funding to schools that take actions they disagree with.

Schools are also facing challenges directly from students, some of whom are taking their universities to court.

The University of Florida’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, a pro-Palestinian group, sued the chancellor of Florida’s university system and other Florida officials this week for ordering a shutdown of the group at the state’s public universities. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the group, said in court documents that disbanding the group violated students’ rights to free speech. The chancellor, Raymond Rodrigues, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Three Jewish students sued New York University on Tuesday, saying the school didn’t do enough to stop antisemitism on campus, making them feel unsafe.

An NYU spokesman said the lawsuit’s allegations were false and that it “paints a bogus picture of conditions on NYU’s campus.” NYU said this week it plans to open a center for studying antisemitism next year.

"Osama bin Laden, Antisemitism and a Viral Tweet: Why TikTok Is Facing Its Biggest Threat",2023-11-17T20:14:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Stu Woo', 'John D. Mckinnon', 'Georgia Wells']","TikTok executives have rushed to respond to what they view as an inaccurate and unfair narrative about its content.

TikTok is facing what it views as perhaps its biggest crisis yet, with the world’s most popular app facing an intense backlash over the perception it favors pro-Palestinian and, at times, antisemitic content.

Citing anti-Israel posts that surfaced on TikTok since the Gaza conflict began and a decades-old Osama bin Laden letter that circulated this week, Washington lawmakers have renewed calls to ban the app in the U.S.

TikTok executives view this ban attempt more seriously than previous ones, according to people inside the company, and have rushed to respond to what they view as an inaccurate and unfair narrative.

Top executives set up meetings with Jewish leaders and celebrities to tell them they take their concerns seriously. They published a post that argues it has been fair in moderating pro-Israel and pro-Palestine videos. When a venture capitalist tweeted that his independent research had found TikTok favors pro-Palestinian content—and said he is convinced it explains why more young people are opposing Israel—TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew personally called him to argue the point.

These efforts haven’t yet stalled the narrative. Nikki Haley, rising in the polls in the Republican presidential primary race, said Friday that the appearance of the bin Laden letter on TikTok is justification for banning the app. And lawmakers say the anti-Israel and bin Laden videos should spur new legislative efforts.

All social-media platforms have been flooded with disinformation, gory content and propaganda since the conflict broke out in early October and have struggled to enforce their respective policies against such posts. But TikTok, where a sizable percentage of young people now get their news, has received the most scrutiny.

This crisis is testing TikTok’s Washington-based lobbying operation—which has spent $7.4 million so far this year, on pace to double the amount from last year—and its chief communications officer, Zenia Mucha, a high-profile recent hire who once held the same role at

. And it presents the biggest challenge to date for Chew, who endured a hostile Congressional hearing in March.

TikTok is unlike other social-media platforms because it is owned by a Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and thus vulnerable to shifting political winds.

Lawmakers from both parties, as well as some Biden administration officials, say the Chinese government could order TikTok to spy on its 150 million American users or to spread propaganda. TikTok says it would never comply with such an order—and that it is in the process of siloing off its U.S. operations from China with a $1.5 billion plan.

TikTok executives don’t know whether the company, which is unprofitable, can survive in the rest of the world if banned in the U.S. It depends on the big American market for ad sales and is banking on a budding U.S. e-commerce business as a new revenue stream. Chew said in an interview earlier this year that the U.S. also provides another unique asset: internet celebrities considered cool around the globe because they represent modern Americana.

Bipartisan momentum to ban TikTok was high immediately after Chew’s congressional hearing. But it petered out, congressional aides say, in part because lawmakers got distracted by more attention-grabbing issues.

Then Hamas, the militant group that controls the Palestinian territory of Gaza, attacked Israel on Oct. 7, sparking war.

TikTok responded by creating a virtual “command center,” with Arabic and Hebrew moderators in Singapore, Ireland and the U.S., monitoring war-related content 24 hours a day, according to people familiar with the matter.

It got feedback from its Middle East Safety Advisory Council, a group of seven academics and other experts. The members flagged questionable videos in an active group chat with their TikTok liaison, and the company was responsive in removing them, two council members said in interviews. But TikTok hasn’t been perfect.

“They may be overwhelmed,” said Naila Hamdy, a council member and journalism professor at the American University in Cairo, in an interview two weeks after the war started. “There is stuff on there that, if I were a moderator, I would remove altogether.”

Behind the scenes, TikTok moderators struggled to balance censoring antisemitic and anti-Muslim content, according to people familiar with the matter. In the early days of the war, they focused on removing antisemitic videos and comments, the people said.

Then, when TikTok started noticing more celebrities supporting Palestinians, the company became more concerned about anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim content, the people said. Moderators shifted their focus to remove those videos and comments.

The effect was to seesaw back and forth as TikTok’s leaders tried to impose human moderation, on top of its normal automated processes, in order to react to what videos are popular at any given moment.

“If you aren’t actively seeking balance, things can get out of whack pretty fast,” said one person who was involved in the efforts.

In a statement, a TikTok spokeswoman said: “There is no balancing to be done—we remove hate speech, period, and it’s not dependent on the day of the week.”

On Oct. 26, a California venture capitalist named Jeff Morris Jr. wrote posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, that said TikTok was being controlled by a combination of bots, or automated software, and people paid to promote anti-Israel views by Hamas-supporting organizations. He also said TikTok had far more pro-Palestine hashtags, or phrases, compared with pro-Israel ones.

His posts have garnered about 10 million views. Chew, TikTok’s chief, was so alarmed that he called Morris and said that his analysis was flawed, according to people familiar with the matter. Chew failed to get Morris to recant his posts.

Morris didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The problem escalated when politicians began saying that TikTok was promoting pro-Palestinian content to turn American young people against Israel. In early November, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R., Wis.), chairman of the House committee on China, wrote an essay for an online publication calling TikTok “digital fentanyl.” He said it is “brainwashing our youth” by promoting anti-Israel content. The op-ed was widely shared by other conservatives.

Days later, Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, renewing his calls for a Treasury Department-led panel on foreign investment to ban the app in the U.S. Hawley cited “the ubiquity of anti-Israel content on TikTok, where most young internet users get their information about the world.”

At a GOP presidential debate in Miami last week, a number of candidates echoed the calls to ban TikTok. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie charged that TikTok was “polluting the minds of American young people” with “antisemitic, horrible stuff.”

“This is China trying to further divide the United States of America,” he said.

TikTok eventually rebutted the concerns this past Monday. In a blog post on its website, TikTok said comparing hashtags is a flawed way of determining whether a platform is biased, and that rival platforms have similar ratios of pro-Palestine versus pro-Israel content. It also pointed out that support for Israel has declined over time for younger people, and younger people are more likely to use TikTok.

TikTok thought it was turning the page. Then a new problem arose this week: a proliferation of posts in which users cited bin Laden’s 2002 “Letter to America,” an antisemitic document in which he justified the Sept. 11 attacks. Politicians including Haley and Gallagher cited that as the latest reason to ban TikTok.

In a statement, TikTok said that content promoting the letter violates its policies and that it has taken steps to squelch its spread. It said it counted 274 videos with the hashtag #lettertoamerica, and that those videos had been viewed a total of 1.85 million times, which is low compared with popular hashtags with several hundred million views. Posts with the hashtag #gymtok, for example, had more than 200 million views over the same period.

TikTok has set up meetings with leaders of the Jewish community in the U.S., including one on Sunday between Chew and former Rep. Ted Deutch (D., Fla.), who is now CEO of the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group.

On Wednesday, two top executives held a video call with a group of Jewish celebrities including chef Eitan Bernath and comedians Amy Schumer and Sacha Baron Cohen. The group had written an open letter to the company, saying it didn’t have enough safeguards to protect the Jewish community from digital and physical danger.

“I appreciated TikTok’s leadership coming to the table for this crucial conversation,” Bernath said in a statement. “We all love TikTok and are eager to hear what leadership commits to doing to ensure TikTok is a safe place for Jewish creators and the Jewish community at large.”

In “Don’t Hire My Anti-Semitic Law Students” (op-ed, Oct. 16), our colleague Steven Davidoff Solomon at the University of California, Berkeley, urges law firms not to hire students who support Palestinian liberation, accusing them of anti-Semitism. While he has a legal right to express his sentiments, a tenured professor advocating punishment based on political beliefs abdicates the duty of education.

Prof. Solomon’s op-ed has a chilling effect on students’ political speech and fundamentally violates academic integrity. It fosters doxing and discrimination against students expressing solidarity with Palestinians facing genocide by Israel. Instead of engaging or protecting, it fans aggression against them. And Mr. Solomon is not alone."

TikTok’s hot new social-media influencer is . . . Osama bin Laden . Yes, the terrorist who plotted 9/11 went viral this week, and not in a good way. Users have been posting videos to the Chinese-owned app, urging their followers to read bin Laden’s 2002 “letter to America,” while suggesting he was on to something. “I will never look at this country the same,” one user said.

The videos racked up hundreds of thousands of views. TikTok said Thursday it is “aggressively removing” such content. “The number of videos on TikTok is small and reports of it trending on our platform are inaccurate,” the company said. Then it blamed critics and journalists for noticing, saying that all the attention was driving more traffic to the posts. The British newspaper the Guardian unpublished its copy of the bin Laden letter, posted in 2002, because it was being “widely shared on social media without the full context.”"
The Hamas Big Fish Who Got Away,2023-11-16T18:25:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Laura Blumenfeld'],"President Biden warned Israel not to be “consumed by rage,” even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised “mighty vengeance” against Hamas. But revenge isn’t the only anger at play, or even the most corrosive. The fury that’s eating Israel’s war cabinet is regret. No matter how the military responds, there’s a sense that it’s too late.

“We blew it,” Maj. Gen. Yoav Gallant , now Israel’s defense minister, told me following a Sept. 6, 2003, airstrike on Hamas leadership. (I was a Washington Post reporter.) Eight senior Hamas commanders, including bomb makers and developers of Qassam rockets, had met for lunch on the ground floor of a Gaza home. It was a rare daylight appearance of Mohammed Deif , Hamas’s shadowy military leader.

“The terrorist dream team” is how Avi Dichter, then head of Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, described the guest list at the time. Mr. Dichter, Gen. Gallant and other Israeli security officials in the 2003 war room plunged into hours of debate about what size bomb to drop in Gaza, weighing the risks of civilian casualties.

Palestinian children were playing outside the home. It was “a tragic dilemma,” one general said, a lose-lose decision of the sort they had argued and anguished over many times before. Mr. Dichter advocated for an all-out assault. The defense minister at the time called it “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” In the long run, several argued, it would save Israeli and Palestinian lives.

Inside the Gaza home, Hamas’s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, was spooning rice onto the plate of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, Hamas’s spiritual founder, when the Israeli air force F-16 released its ordnance onto the roof. The explosion shook the dining room, Mr. Haniyeh told me afterward. Dust rained down from the ceiling. He looked up.

“We are hit, Sheik,” Mr. Haniyeh said, laughing bitterly.

But at the last minute, the Israelis had replaced the 1-ton lethal payload with a quarter-ton bomb. They wanted to spare civilians. The smaller bomb, Israeli officials concluded, was a moral and public-opinion imperative. The government’s legitimacy depended on domestic and international support and sympathy. All eight Hamas leaders fled the house, alive.

When I asked Gen. Gallant about the decision to replace the 1-ton bomb, he seethed: “You either attack or you don’t.”

“Three moral successes don’t equal one operational success,” Mr. Dichter said, rapping the edge of his desk with his wedding band. He is now Israel’s agricultural minister. “We failed. Period.”

Today, Mr. Deif commands Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam brigades. An Israeli general who took part in the 2003 ordnance debate and is now serving in the government said in a recent interview that his daughter’s best friend was murdered by Hamas at the music festival. “We made a mistake,” he said, voice heavy with sorrow. “We should have killed them.”

A second spectral mistake chasing Israel’s war cabinet is Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s Gaza leader. The Israel Defense Forces now identify him as “the face of evil.” Together with Mr. Deif, Mr. Sinwar is believed to have masterminded the Oct. 7 massacre. In 2011 Mr. Netanyahu exchanged more than 1,000 Palestinian convicts for a single Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit. The swap included Mr. Sinwar. The uneven 2011 deal, the prime minister’s detractors say, inspired Hamas’s hostage-taking operation last month, an effort to empty Israel’s security prisons again.

Hostage negotiations are especially vexing for Mr. Netanyahu, given his family history. While freeing Jewish hostages at Entebbe in 1976, his brother Yoni was killed at age 30. His mother, Cela, once showed me Yoni’s letters, chess set and dented dog tags. She sat alone on a Friday evening in the Jerusalem home where she had raised her sons. Proud of Yoni’s life, she saw futility in his death.

“I was angry. What for?” Cela said looking back some 20 years after the Entebbe rescue mission. Why had the Israeli government refused to negotiate with the hijackers who were seeking the release of 53 prisoners? “Thousands of prisoners are released today. For that, Yoni had to be killed? It wasn’t worth it.”

Today Benjamin Netanyahu says there will be “no cease-fire without the release of our hostages.” Civilian casualties are painfully high, and rising. Mr. Netanyahu has set a stiff military objective: total elimination of Hamas, with Messrs. Deif and Sinwar as top targets. Israel had both years ago and let them go. They’re now in Gaza, underground, almost certainly laughing. There is no light at the end of Hamas tunnels. And no end to regret until they’re dead.

All Is Quiet in Oil Markets—for Now,2023-11-15T22:39:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Daniel Yergin'],"A war in the Middle East typically sends oil prices soaring, since the region is home to about half of the world’s proven reserves. Not this time. After ticking up a few dollars, the price of Brent crude has been even or lower than on Oct. 6, the day before Hamas’s attack on Israel. There are three reasons for this: the shale revolution, market psychology and a transformation in the politics of oil.

The shale revolution rebalanced the market. The U.S., once the world’s largest oil importer, is now its largest producer. On a net basis, the U.S. is “energy independent.” The very existence of a source on this scale is a bulwark against market panic. It’s also been central to keeping the market well-supplied. Oil demand, spurred by China’s rebound from Covid, has grown strongly this year. It’s up about 2 million barrels a day from last year. But new supplies from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus are more than meeting that growth in demand. The U.S. is at the forefront, adding a million barrels a day, along with Canada, Guyana and Brazil. Last year’s anxiety about supply keeping up with demand has faded in the face of rising production.

Financial investors in the oil market aren’t panicking about possible disruption. Oil prices these days vibrate primarily on economic news and prospects—high interest rates and the possibility of an economic slowdown or recession, all of which would constrain demand, sending prices lower.

And the politics around oil have changed. In contrast to the embargo years of the 1970s, the Gulf Arab countries are thoroughly integrated into the world economy. They are focused on job creation, economic development and investment. They have also been in various stages of dialogue or diplomatic relations with Israel, seeing that as helpful to their own economies, at least up to now.

Yet nothing guarantees that the current market calm will last. As a senior petroleum official from one of the main Gulf exporters observed the other day, “Everybody is on edge.” Guards are up. Significant price spikes would be costly if they led to inflation, lower economic growth, further disruption in global food markets, turmoil in emerging markets and higher gasoline prices heading into a presidential election. Western countries would likely dip into their strategic stocks of petroleum to offset any shortages. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at only half the level it was in 2021, but it still has substantial supplies.

Despite roiling the region politically, the war between Israel and Hamas doesn’t threaten supplies directly. That would change if the war were to spread or expand into areas housing the infrastructure—production facilities, tankers and pipelines—that enables the flow of oil and gas. About 21 million barrels of oil pass through the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz daily, along with substantial amounts of liquefied natural gas. Since the U.S. shale revolution, the bulk of those supplies now head to Asian markets.

Possible disruption could come from direct attacks on facilities, collateral damage, errant action or interdiction of tanker transit. The general expectation is that any such disruption would come from Iranian-linked militias or proxies, which are barraging U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, or from Iran itself. That was the case in the 2019 missile and drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq production facility, probably the most important single piece of infrastructure in the global oil industry. It was never clearly established whether the attack came from Iraq, Iran or the Houthis in Yemen. The assault slashed Saudi petroleum production in half. But it is noteworthy that the response to the attack demonstrated considerable resilience given that the Saudis had Abqaiq back in full operation in a matter of weeks.

Such an attack today would jeopardize Iran’s efforts to improve its relationships with the Arab Gulf states. Last year China helped negotiate the resumption of diplomatic relations between Riyadh and Tehran. Iran is already benefiting from the current situation: The movement toward Saudi-Israeli diplomatic recognition is stalled, and Israel is embattled. The war’s spread would also impose direct costs on Iran, which currently moves up to 1.5 million barrels a day through the Strait of Hormuz. These exports supply more than $40 billion annually to Tehran. There’s also deterrence. The growing presence of the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf should discourage Iran from doing anything that might boomerang.

China itself may also serve as an important check on any effort to disrupt oil flows out of the Middle East. It is by far the largest oil importer, buying about 75% of its annual consumption from the world market. Roughly half of what China imports passes through the Strait of Hormuz. China is also by far the largest buyer of Iranian oil. It would certainly be in Beijing’s interest to use its influence to keep the oil flowing unimpeded and, facing its own economic challenges, help keep oil prices from spiking. That is a topic for further dialogue between China and the U.S.

The Shock of Facing American Anti-Semitism,2023-11-15T18:58:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Joel Engel'],"Thousand Oaks, Calif.

It’s a long story how I came to be standing some years ago in Archbishop’s Palace in Naples alongside six Italian-Americans from New York—four academics, a monsignor, and a New York Supreme Court judge—to meet with the cardinal. Each of the others kissed his ring as he went down the line. I, at the end, turned his hand vertically and shook it. His eyes widened. Someone explained that I was Jewish, which delighted him, and for the next hour he directed all his answers to me, regardless of who had posed the questions.

Outside afterward one of the academics asked why I didn’t kiss the cardinal’s ring. Before I could explain that we kiss liturgical objects, not men, the judge shouted: “They only kiss a—.”

They.

Two of the others physically restrained me from drop-kicking his family jewels into the Bay of Naples. I was in my 40s, and this was my first authentic, unambiguous anti-Semitic comment from the mouth of another American.

I assumed that it was a one-off and rarely thought of the judge for years. But now I can’t stop thinking about him—that is, how much company he has and apparently always did. How could I have missed that? How had we all?

There isn’t an American Jew I know whose worldview wasn’t trampled by the anti-Semitism that has been displayed in this country with such fervor and pride since the barbaric attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Millions more Americans than we ever imagined consider us less than human and would like to see us dead. That’s a lot to deal with so suddenly and unexpectedly.

Every conversation I’ve had with American Jews since then has eventually reached the point of trying to describe accurately this sudden and now unrelenting anxiety and unease none of us had felt before, which all of us agree is located deep in our kishkes, suggesting it’s epigenetic in origin: an inherited memory of the Holocaust and all the lesser pogroms that preceded it that we didn’t know we were carrying.

Here in 2023 America, not 1938 Germany: Jewish students hiding in a college library from a mob; Jews being told not to “look Jewish” in public—or, better yet, to stay home; Hamas supporters trying to break down a door to Grand Central Terminal without a policeman in sight or an arrest made; swastikas proudly displayed; chants of “Globalize the intifada,” which is a war cry to kill Jews wherever they live.

One could find a silver lining in that the purveyors of this hate no longer deny the Holocaust. But they wish aloud that Hitler had finished the job. And now the denial has taken on an even stranger form. Video of the grotesque acts that Hamas terrorists themselves livestreamed is now often claimed to be Israeli propaganda, and the 240 hostages the work of the Jews.

That this is happening in the United States of America—the country where for 250 years Jews have been safer than we were anywhere else throughout history—and may continue to happen and get possibly much worse is a game-changer for us and for our relationship to most everything. Sure, there were restricted country clubs and college quotas and otherwise nonviolent forms of anti-Semitism for decades. But there weren’t Cossacks or Nazis. “Never again” meant that murderous Jew hate lay on the trash heap of history. Or so we thought, believing as an article of faith that we would never have to deal with the horrors our great-grandparents in the old country had.

True, it was hard not to notice rising anti-Semitism in the last few years—Kanye West, Charlottesville, Pittsburgh. But the offenders, we assumed, were marginal, shunned by polite society. There were no observable indications that Jew hate would reach critical mass more quickly than it did in Germany 90 years ago.

The unavoidable conclusion is that this hatred was there all along, waiting for the on button to be pushed. That realization can’t fail to refract our view of this world and, alas, our country.

Two miles from where I live, a 69-year-old man named Paul Kessler died after a confrontation with a Hamas supporter, who some eyewitnesses say whacked the victim in the face with a bull horn, causing him to fall and hit his head on the sidewalk. (The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, but police say they have been unable to establish probable cause for an arrest because of conflicting accounts.) For more than a decade, Kessler was known to be a prolific letter writer to our community’s free weekly newspaper, always taking the liberal-left position as most secular Jews seem to do. One imagines that he, like millions of us, had been shocked to find that many of the people he had always believed were his philosophical and political compatriots actually hated him for being a Jew.

Whether they had all along is irrelevant. That they do now is why Jews in this country wonder whether we’ll ever feel as comfortable as we always had; and it explains why we are so grateful to Gentiles of goodwill who have reached out, by word and deed, to stand with us. May they continue to outnumber the Jew haters so that we don’t redefine “Never again” to mean only that never again will we allow Germany to kill six million Jews between the years 1933 and 1945.

The U.N. Is Central to Life in Gaza. Now Its Mission There Is Collapsing.,2023-11-14T14:29:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Jared Malsin', 'Anas Baba']","RAFAH, Gaza Strip—Huddled in classrooms and crouching under tarps slung up in the courtyard, Palestinians seeking refuge from the fighting raging in Gaza have crowded into a United Nations-run school here near the Egyptian border.

The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees runs 183 schools in the Gaza Strip, most of which have been pressed into service as shelters. The agency, which also runs bakeries and clinics and provides financial aid, has been central to life in the Palestinian enclave for more than 70 years.

As Israel and Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza, battle, the agency says its ability to cope is fraying. More than 100 of its workers have been killed. An Israeli blockade, imposed after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, has cut off almost all shipments of food, fuel, water and medicine.

On Tuesday, a U.N. spokeswoman said lack of fuel meant the agency’s functions would “start gradually collapsing” as ambulances, sewage and sanitation systems shut down.

The following day, Israel said it would allow aid trucks to refuel for the first time in the conflict. But Unrwa’s director of affairs in Gaza said it represented only 9% of the agency’s daily needs in the strip and Israeli authorities had restricted its use to transporting aid. “No fuel for water or hospitals,” Thomas White said on X, formerly Twitter.

At least 66 people sheltering in U.N. compounds have been killed in the fighting, and more than 550 others injured, the U.N. says. Hamas, which is designated by the U.S., the European Union and others as a terrorist organization, has blamed Israel, saying it is attacking U.N. sites.

Israel’s military says Hamas has built tunnels near some U.N. schools and fired rockets from areas close to them. Hamas didn’t respond to a request for comment on allegations it builds tunnels under the schools or uses them to hide materiel.

Since the Hamas assault on Israel—which included terrorist attacks on a music festival and agricultural communities and killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities—the country has waged a campaign of airstrikes and ground operations it says are aimed at eliminating Hamas.

On Sunday, the U.N. said shelling from an Israeli warship hit a guesthouse where the agency’s international workers stay. The Israeli military said it “carried out a strike based on operational requirements, adjacent to a U.N. building.”

UNRWA said it inspects its schools to make sure that there is no military equipment or activity that could compromise their neutral status. Spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai said buildings were inspected before the war and that the agency had monitored those entering the schools since.

Last year, UNRWA identified what it called a man-made cavity underneath the grounds of one of its schools in Gaza, in what it said was a “serious violation of the agency’s neutrality and breach of international law.” The agency protested to the local authorities in Gaza, it said.

“We ourselves are very intent on making sure that our schools remain neutral U.N. places, but we cannot speak for what Hamas does or doesn’t do under our schools,” Alrifai said.

Israeli military officials say Hamas operates in and near civilian buildings. The Israeli government also accuses UNRWA of employing Hamas militants—an allegation it denies.

“Hamas has taken control of the whole of Gaza including U.N. installations. We have done everything we can in this intensive war to avoid damage to any international installation,” said a senior Israeli military official. He said some were “hit because Hamas put weapons inside schools.”

More than three-quarters of a million people have descended on UNRWA school shelters since the outbreak of war. The average number of people per shelter now is more than 6,250, which the U.N. said is nine times higher than the intended capacity.

In times of peace, U.N. schools form a core part of Gaza’s education system, teaching about 300,000 pupils, or about half the total number of students in the strip. “They come out of here as engineers and doctors and lawyers,” said Abu Hisham Subih, a 55-year-old who took shelter in the school here after the war broke out.

Israel says the schools’ curriculum, which is shared by those operated by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, contains antisemitic material and teaches hatred.

The agency’s commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, said the allegation was “false and insidious.” The agency says that it adapts textbooks to teach core U.N. principles such as tolerance and nondiscrimination.

In times of war, Palestinians flock to the schools for shelter. “It was incredible at first the rush to these UNRWA schools with the deep belief that the schools are protected,” said Alrifai. “But the reality is that in Gaza there’s nowhere safe.”

Across Gaza, more than 11,000 people, more than half of them women and children, have been killed since Oct. 7, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave. The figures don’t distinguish between civilians and militants.

On Monday, UNRWA said it received reports from witnesses that Israeli security forces entered one school and two health centers in Gaza City and used the installations for military operations.

The U.N. said witnesses reported that Israeli soldiers conducted interrogations and arrested some people sheltering in the installations. The Israeli military didn’t respond to a request for comment.

U.N. officials say they share the coordinates of all U.N. installations in Gaza with both sides each day.

Palestinians say they continue to seek shelter in the schools because they have nowhere else to turn. “The people in this school, their homes are destroyed. Where are they going to go? In the streets?” said Subih, the Palestinian camped out here.

Founded to address the needs of Palestinians who fled their homes during the 1948 war at the creation of Israel, the agency now serves both the refugees and their descendants, the majority of Gaza’s more than two million residents.

UNRWA’s blue and white logo is everywhere in the strip, a symbol of stability amid years of political and economic turbulence.

Hundreds of thousands of people remain in northern Gaza, many of them still in U.N. schools, with rapidly shrinking supplies, the agency says. The U.N. says it hasn’t been able to verify the number of people in the shelters in the north since Oct. 12 due to a lack of access and communications.

In the south, U.N. schools have become severely overcrowded. Palestinians wait in line for hours each day for bread, water and other essentials. Brawls and disputes have begun breaking out in the lines as frustration builds, according to the U.N.

Officials at the agency are increasingly worried about the spread of gastrointestinal and other diseases in the packed facilities, where 160 people share one toilet and 700 a shower.

Issa Fayoumi, a teenager from Rafah who took shelter in the schools, said drinking water is available only once a day. “And the bathrooms,” he said. “I swear to God.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
U.S. Needs to Be Ready for War,2023-11-14T22:35:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Holman W. Jenkins'],"Since Oct. 7 I keep thinking of Jack Nicholson , as a Marine colonel in “A Few Good Men,” bellowing “You can’t handle the truth.” I think of this line in respect to friends of Israel who are shocked by the bestiality of that day’s attack, as if history didn’t furnish examples and the assault wasn’t designed to achieve a desired effect.

I think of the Nicholson line in respect to students who cheer on Hamas from their campus safety, having no real conception of violence and expecting to be shielded from even having their feelings hurt. (If the draft makes a comeback, they will have some growing up to do.)

Another truth may soon have to be handled. The U.S. can be expected to serve its own interests, as filtered through the electoral interests of its president. The U.S. has moved a sizable force to the eastern Mediterranean. If sustained, it will allow Israel to complete the neutralization of Hamas and assure its timid Arab partners where the power still lies. That is, if U.S. politics can endure the gruesome necessities, blunders and inevitable allegations about war crimes that come in the wake of Israeli (or any) military action. The alternative, we will have to keep reminding ourselves, is unlikely to be prettier.

The Ukraine policy of Joe Biden has included whiffs of impatience with Ukraine for continuing to fight. An implicit shot clock was all but placed on its current offensive, as if to say, “Hurry up and reclaim whatever land you can so we can get to a cease-fire.” Weapons have been held back, it sometimes seemed, because of White House fear of what might happen from too much Ukrainian success.

Last week came a confession from Ukraine’s Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, using the word that Ukraine’s supporters in the West recently strived to make taboo: stalemate. Technology—surveillance drones—makes it difficult to concentrate forces for a decisive breakthrough, though this applies to both sides. Understandably, in Gen. Zaluzhnyi’s mind “defeat” is Ukraine not recovering all its territory. He doesn’t exactly blame the U.S. but . . . And yet the pessimism can be overdone.

If the U.S. isn’t committed to Ukraine regaining all its territory, it’s now fully committed to Ukraine’s independence and deterrence of Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky should ask not just for F-16s but, by a date certain, F-35s. Mr. Biden should supply them. The Russians, for practical purposes, are at maximum effort. Unlike Stalin (with vast material help from the Roosevelt administration) Vladimir Putin isn’t building a massive army for the offensive. Further mobilization of his male population is low on his list of desirables—as the Biden administration undoubtedly calculates. Instability is growing on his southern periphery, along with the promise of Chinese mischief. Ukraine is a major new military power on his western border. With their formidable military capabilities, Sweden and Finland are becoming part of NATO. It likely means something that Mr. Putin’s subaltern Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus is also burbling about a “stalemate.”

Sixty years later, recommended reading in the Pentagon is again T.R. Fehrenbach’s 1963 history of the Korean War. The author explains the Truman tiptoe, the president’s willingness to settle for a tie rather than victory.

Like Mr. Biden, President Truman waited months to give a speech on the conflict. Then the U.S. wasn’t fighting a war, it was preventing one—World War III. Fresh in the mind of Truman and his advisers was America’s experience of total war in World War II. Also fresh was the recognition that the U.S. was losing its immunity to having its own cities burned to the ground.

A group of nuclear-capable states today assesses the U.S. to be a declining power. Russia and Iran have placed their bets. These bets would be stronger if China did the same. That’s why all eyes are on Taiwan. There are two sides to our truth-handling shortfall. Recall Truman’s distaste for Oppenheimer’s mooning over Hiroshima when Truman had many more deaths on his conscience. Recall Lincoln’s delight in Grant’s uncompromising approach to war. Americans have been blessed to find humane men who nevertheless recognize what must be done and are willing to do it. Too often, though, we find them in time to fight wars that might have been deterred.

Had the domestically possible included a bit more stomach for risk taking by our leaders and electorate, World War II likely would have been avoided. If the Truman administration had been clearer in its own mind about its willingness to defend South Korea and communicated as much to Stalin, the Korean War likely wouldn’t have happened. Accepting the inhumane logic of conflict and of power realities is an uphill fight against the lure of risk avoidance and the illusion that our desire for peace is shared by others. The American record has often been one of recognizing this slower than it might have.

Rishi Sunak and the Strange Death of Conservative England,2023-11-14T22:28:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Dominic Green'],"London

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak fired Suella Braverman as home secretary on Monday for saying what nearly three quarters of Conservative Party voters think. In the short run, Ms. Braverman’s sacking deprives her of a platform to challenge Mr. Sunak’s leadership. But when he dares to face the voters—at some point before January 2025, according to electoral law—the Conservatives will be eviscerated. Mr. Sunak has put personal interest before party, and party before country.

Anti-Israel protests have overrun central London every Saturday since Hamas murdered some 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7. Marchers have celebrated the terror group, called for jihad and the destruction of Israel, obstructed train stations, launched fireworks at the police, and engaged in recreational Jew-baiting. The Labour Party and Sadiq Khan, the city’s Labour mayor, have backed them. The police have indulged multiple breaches of British law in the name of “community relations.”

The most sacred days in the country’s civic calendar fell last weekend. Saturday was Armistice Day, when the British honor their war dead with two minutes of silence, followed by Remembrance Sunday, with its ceremonies and second rite of silence at the Cenotaph memorial in Whitehall. The head of the London police didn’t object to Saturday’s march. Mr. Sunak merely disapproved. Ms. Braverman broke ranks.

The marches, she wrote in London’s Times on Nov. 8, are “highly offensive.” A “show of strength” on Armistice Day would amount to “an assertion of primacy by certain groups, particularly Islamists” akin to the Orange marches that disfigure the streets of Northern Ireland. The linkage between some of the organizers and “terrorist groups, including Hamas” also evoked the Troubles. Senior police officers were “playing favorites,” and the disorder and incitement were worsening. In the interest of “the broader public good,” the state should proscribe the “hate marchers.”

A London Telegraph poll found that 72% of Conservative voters agreed the event should be canceled. Another survey revealed that only a fifth of Britons, most of them young, supported the protesters. The march went ahead. On Saturday, a motley crowd of soccer fans and far-right nationalists pushed through the police lines near the Cenotaph and held a two-minute silence in impeccable order. Then they brawled with the police and the much larger anti-Israel contingent. Ms. Braverman’s warning was vindicated.

The Conservative Party is 20 points behind in the polls, and Mr. Sunak has favorability ratings worse than President Biden’s in the U.S. This was his last chance to pivot toward public opinion on immigration, Islamism, integration and the culture war. Instead he dumped Ms. Braverman, tribune of the party’s restive right wing, and hired David Cameron, a social liberal, as his new foreign secretary. If the latter sounds familiar, it should: Mr. Cameron was prime minister from 2010-16. He resigned after his campaign to stay in the European Union failed in that year’s Brexit referendum. Rather than honor his promise to respect the public’s vote, he retired to write his memoirs in a mobile shepherd’s hut on his Cotswolds estate. He then is reported to have earned millions advising the finance group Greensill Capital, which collapsed in 2021, and as vice chairman of an unsuccessful U.K.-China investment fund.

This shuffle isn’t a pivot to the center. It is a collapse into factional folly. The Conservatives have traditionally been successful because they change their leaders and policies to suit the public mood. Mr. Sunak, like Mr. Cameron before him, has shown how out of touch he is by setting the party against the people. The Conservatives, masters of in-house assassination, are committing electoral suicide.

The party is losing the public in more ways than one. Since the 1960s, the old Conservative base has atrophied. The aristocracy, church and officer class no longer set the tone from the Tory heights. Affluence and higher education have turned the once-respectable middle classes into lifestyle liberals. The party has, however, remained posh enough to shun the patriotic working and lower-middle classes, and provincial enough to patronize the children of immigrants such as Ms. Braverman.

The long rhythm of British politics is now against the Conservatives. British voters stick with a party until it achieves total incompetence. This usually takes about 13 years. The Conservatives ruled from 1951-64; Labour (with a Conservative interlude) from 1964-79; the Conservatives from 1979-97; and Labour from 1997-2010. The Conservatives are now in year 14 and imploding on schedule. Exile awaits.

Mr. Cameron will resort to the Cotswolds. Mr. Sunak will probably flee to a sinecure in Silicon Valley. The Conservatives will change or die, as the old Liberals did. In 1906, the Liberals, the default party of Victorian politics, won the kind of landslide that Boris Johnson did in 2019. A decade later, they split over economic and culture-war arguments similar to those now splitting the Conservatives. Then, it concerned female suffrage, imperialism, Ireland and an alliance with France; now, it’s Islamism, immigration, Ireland and Brexit. By 1957 there were only five Liberal members of Parliament. As the joke went, they held their party meetings in the back of a London cab.

This, as the title of George Dangerfield’s 1935 book had it, was “The Strange Death of Liberal England.” We are now witnessing the strange death of Conservative England. The default party of government lost its people and then its principles. Now it will lose power, and then its purpose. But as English liberalism survived the death of the old Liberal Party, so English conservatism will return.

When it does, it will sound more like Ms. Braverman and Nigel Farage than Mr. Sunak and Mr. Cameron. It will stand for strong borders, law and order, cultural cohesion, economic growth and free healthcare. It will probably still be called the Conservative Party, but it will resemble a European-style populist one with a surprisingly large number of nonwhite voters. They too will expect it to conserve England. Stranger things have happened.

Review & Outlook: On Nov. 18, 2022, Jeremy Hunt unveiled the U.K.'s budget. Rishi Sunak’s Conservative Party has ditched Liz Truss’s supply-side tax and regulatory reforms in favor of a plan to tax and spend Britain to prosperity."
Rishi Sunak Rearranges the Deck Chairs,2023-11-13T23:42:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['The Editorial Board'],"United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reshuffled his cabinet Monday, and Britons can be forgiven if they don’t learn his new ministers’ names. They might not be around long. Changing ministers at this late date is unlikely to change the bleak Tory prospects in an election expected next year.

The reshuffle brought two major personnel changes. One is the firing of Suella Braverman as home secretary with responsibility for policing and immigration. Her sins are said to include publishing a controversial column last week in the Times of London (which shares ownership with this newspaper) criticizing pro-Palestine marches in London, and failing to stop illegal immigration across the English Channel.

The other is the hiring of former Prime Minister David Cameron as foreign secretary. Mr. Cameron resigned as PM after his campaign to stay in the European Union failed in the 2016 Brexit referendum. He squandered a parliamentary majority he won a year earlier.

Both are puzzling decisions. Ms. Braverman’s description of the pro-Palestine protests in London and elsewhere as “hate marches” is blunt but seems to resonate with Mr. Sunak’s Conservative Party base. Tory turmoil helps the opposition Labour Party, which until Monday was the leader in internal turmoil over the Israel-Hamas war and protests.

Mr. Cameron is a tribune of the big-government conservatism that has left the Tories in a rut after 13 years in power. His history of boosterism over business links to China and his 2010 description of Gaza as “a prison camp” make him especially questionable as a foreign minister given the international challenges facing Britain now.

Mr. Sunak may hope a cabinet with more experienced hands will reassure voters that the Tories remain the most competent party. But Monday’s reshuffle didn’t change economic policy, which remains the Tories’ biggest vulnerability.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt remains in his post with his high-tax, high-spend formula for fighting inflation. The Tories hope the inflation rate will have fallen below 5% by the end of this year to meet one of Mr. Sunak’s promises to voters. But it will take years for inflation-adjusted earnings to catch up to the new, higher price level. Until then the political squeeze will continue.

This is the record that’s dragging the Tories to double-digit shortfalls against Labour in opinion polls, and Mr. Sunak shouldn’t give them less reason to vote Conservative on foreign policy or law and order. Accidents can happen in elections, so the Tories still have a chance. But conservative parties looking for an electoral sure thing rather than relying on luck can note the policy failures that have left Mr. Sunak rolling the dice on the symbolism of personnel changes.

Review & Outlook: On Nov. 18, 2022, Jeremy Hunt unveiled the U.K.'s budget. Rishi Sunak’s Conservative Party has ditched Liz Truss’s supply-side tax and regulatory reforms in favor of a plan to tax and spend Britain to prosperity."
Israeli Forces Reach Gate of Gaza’s Largest Hospital,2023-11-13T11:40:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Dov Lieber', 'Chao Deng']","TEL AVIV—Israeli troops reached at least one of the gates of Gaza’s largest hospital where Israel says Hamas conceals a major center of operations, while medical staff reported deteriorating conditions inside because of a lack of supplies and electricity.

The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Israeli military vehicles were at the southeast gate of Al-Shifa Hospital, and an Israeli military spokesman confirmed that troops had reached one of the gates. Israel alleges that Hamas runs four underground complexes and a command-and-control center at the hospital, a claim Hamas denies.

Thousands of people in the hospital, including patients and doctors, have largely been cut off from the outside world for three days, amid what medical workers describe as relentless gunfire around the hospital buildings.

“It’s still a total siege—no one can get out or come in,” said Marwan Abusada, the head of surgery at Al-Shifa. A few people were able to leave Monday morning, but another group returned after coming under fire near the gate, he said.

Israeli military officials said they have made a safe corridor for people to leave the hospital and explained the corridor to hospital staff. If anyone was firing at people leaving the hospital, it would be Hamas forces and not Israeli soldiers, said a senior Israeli military official with the Givati infantry brigade, one of the main Israeli fighting forces on the ground in Gaza.

Doctors said they were unable to move between buildings and couldn’t see who was firing. Evacuating injured patients isn’t feasible, and leaving from the hospital’s east side—as Israel has directed them—remained unsafe, they said.

“It is my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital,” President Biden said Monday. “The hospital must be protected.”

In response to international pressure over the mounting humanitarian disaster at Gaza hospitals, the Israeli military Monday released a video that it said showed evidence of militants operating inside the Al-Rantisi Hospital in northern Gaza, including a large pile of weapons. It also showed footage of a basement where it said Hamas might have held hostages after bringing them back from southern Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks.

Separately, the Israeli military showed footage of a tunnel entrance a few hundred meters from the hospital it said likely ran near or under the building.

It was the first time Israel had shown video footage from a hospital to support its claims that militants operate there.

Khalil al-Hayya, a member of Hamas’s top leadership body, dismissed Israel’s accusations, saying that the hospital basement was used solely for medical purposes. “Among their lies, they presented weapons whose origin we don’t know,” he said in a statement. “If there were fighters in the hospital, why would they leave their weapons inside?”

The Israeli military said that the evacuation of Al-Rantisi Hospital finished Sunday after Hamas lost control of the area and stopped preventing civilians from leaving, which enabled the sick and wounded to leave.

An Israeli military spokesperson said Al-Shifa Hospital isn’t being evacuated because Hamas is still trying to maintain control of it.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday said Hamas had “lost control of Gaza.” Israeli officials circulated a photo showing troops had taken over the Gaza parliament building near the Al-Shifa Hospital.

Militants continued to launch rockets from Gaza toward Israel, with a barrage fired across central Israel Monday night.

Giora Eiland, a former Israeli general and national security adviser, said Israel had achieved notable military victories but that Hamas could still achieve its goals if Israel is forced to stop the war with Hamas’s top leadership still alive in southern Gaza, and the more than 200 hostages taken by Hamas and other militants on Oct. 7 still under their control. He said Israeli troops had come close to defeating two Hamas brigades in northern Gaza but that Hamas has three other brigades in central and southern Gaza as well.

Inside Al-Shifa, doctors are struggling to provide basic care to hundreds of patients amid a power outage and lack of medical supplies. More than 30 people including children died recently, Mohamed Zaqout, director of hospitals in Gaza, said at a press briefing Monday.

Three babies died over the weekend, while 36 have been left without working incubators, said Abusada, the surgeon. “We are depending totally on solar energy,” he said. “We don’t have electricity from other sources.”

A senior Israeli military official with the Givati infantry brigade said sporadic fighting had taken place in the vicinity of the hospital in recent days. The official said Hamas militants emerged from buildings or tunnels, fired their weapons then tried to scramble back to safety underground. “They are fighting urban guerrilla warfare,” he said.

The official said at no point did his forces in the area carry out any direct strikes on the hospital complex.

At Al-Quds, another hospital in northern Gaza where thousands of people are sheltering, the Israeli military said militants fired at Israeli soldiers from the complex while among civilians. It said it responded and killed 21 militants. It didn’t say whether civilians were killed.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society, which operates Al-Quds, said in a statement that armed individuals approached from the street when Israeli forces were in front of the hospital.

It said no armed people were inside and that its “staff are trapped with patients and the wounded, without electricity, water, or food.”

About half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals have closed, the World Health Organization said over the weekend, some running out of fuel and others damaged by shelling. A convoy of vehicles from the Palestine Red Crescent Society, accompanied by the International Committee of the Red Cross, was unable to conduct evacuations from hospitals because of nearby heavy shelling and shooting Monday, the Red Crescent said.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Israel Pushing for Hamas to Surrender Stricken Al-Shifa Hospital,2023-11-12T14:19:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Chao Deng', 'Dov Lieber', 'Saeed Shah']","Israel said it is pressuring Hamas to surrender its position inside Gaza’s largest hospital on Sunday, as it engaged in intense fighting with militants in the area.

Israel alleges that Hamas hides underground complexes and a key command center at Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, a claim Hamas denies. “The ultimate goal is for them to come out and surrender while we’re in the vicinity of the hospital,” said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesman, referring to Hamas militants. “We haven’t gone in yet.”

A second day of intense fighting on Sunday left thousands of displaced people stuck inside the sprawling complex with dwindling medical supplies, water and food, as well as a power outage caused by a lack of fuel. Israel said Hamas prevented hospital staff from retrieving containers of fuel delivered about 1,000 feet from the hospital entrance by Israeli soldiers on Sunday morning. Staff at the hospital said it was too unsafe to retrieve them.

Doctors at Al-Shifa have described an increasingly desperate situation, with the remaining medical staff there struggling to provide basic care to injured patients. Mohammad Hawajri, a nurse stationed at a Doctors Without Borders office 1,000 feet from Al-Shifa, said the gunfire was too intense for him to walk there on Sunday.

Hawajri said he couldn’t see who was shooting, but heard people screaming and gunfire just outside his building. “We can’t look from our main door because it’s dangerous,” he said.

The head of Al-Shifa, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, told Qatari-funded Al-Araby TV that the fuel from Israel would have only been enough to run the hospital’s generators for 15 to 30 minutes and couldn’t be retrieved for security reasons. He said the fuel would need to be delivered through the Red Cross or other international aid agencies.

Israel has banned fuel from entering the strip since the war began without the release of 239 hostages taken by Palestinians on Oct. 7. Israel says Hamas has fuel that it can provide to hospitals and other civilian organizations, but chooses to use its reserves for militant purposes. Israeli officials say Hamas would also steal new fuel imported into the enclave, as it needs fuel to keep ventilating hundreds of miles of underground tunnels used by its fighters.

Hamas has denied both taking over fuel in the strip and preventing reserves from reaching hospitals.

The depletion of fuel at Al-Shifa has meant a near-complete shutdown of its operations, from its intensive-care unit to incubators for prematurely born babies. Medical staff moved more than 30 babies to beds near an air conditioner that was put on heater mode so they could be kept warm. Two babies died on Saturday, doctors said.

“We know this is very risky. We are expecting to lose more of them day by day,” said Dr. Ahmed Mokhallalati, a surgeon at the hospital.

Al-Shifa has become a focal point of Israel’s efforts in Gaza, with the Israeli military saying it is engaged in intense fighting against Hamas in the hospital’s vicinity, as part of its campaign to eradicate Hamas from the enclave. It hasn’t said how close it is to the hospital.

In addition to the allegation that Hamas runs a command-and-control center from the hospital, a senior Israeli official said there might also be hostages held under the hospital, complicating the military’s ability to operate there.

Hamas on Sunday suspended talks to secure the release of hostages held by the group and militants in Gaza over the fighting at the hospitals, and particularly Al-Shifa Hospital. Hamas senior leaders told Qatar and Egypt, the two main countries mediating the talks, that Israel has again shown it is “not interested in any deal,” two senior Egyptian officials said.

Hostage talks were halted twice previously. Before the talks were suspended, officials were discussing a deal to release up to 100 women and children held captive in Gaza in exchange for up to 100 Palestinian women and children being held in Israeli prisons, a limited amount of fuel to hospitals and regular humanitarian pauses.

The U.S., European Union and Arab neighbors have called on Israel to agree to a humanitarian pause in the fighting to allow aid into Gaza and ease worsening conditions at medical facilities.

A spokesman for Hamas said on Sunday that Israel was bombing Al-Shifa and accused it of killing civilians inside. “The goal is to displace citizens to the south for political goals by trying to confuse citizens by killing the wounded, sick and medical staff,” he said.

The Israeli military has said it is “taking all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians” and declined to comment on military activities that were currently under way.

The Israeli military said it has communicated with staff at Al-Shifa that people inside can safely evacuate via the hospital’s east side. Doctors at the hospital say they believe that leaving from there is still unsafe and that any movement of wounded patients is unfeasible. Of the hundreds of patients remaining, about 60 are in critical condition, said Mokhallalati.

Medical staff inside the hospital say they can’t see who is shooting. Intense barrages of gunfire and explosions around Al-Shifa on Sunday left people there sometimes unable to see outside, Mokhallalati said. “The area was full of smoke, literally you can’t see more than 10 meters in front of your eyes.”

Hawajri, the nurse, said he and others helped drag 10 people who sustained gunshot wounds on Saturday near the main gate of the hospital back inside. At least two people were wounded from gunfire while inside the hospital, doctors said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel was treading carefully with hospitals. “There’s no reason why we just can’t take the patients out of there,” Netanyahu said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He said Israeli forces were helping people move south “by creating safe corridors” and that 50,000 people had made the journey Saturday.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society, which operates Al-Quds Hospital in northern Gaza, said Sunday that the facility was no longer operating because of lack of fuel and a power outage. The hospital was sheltering roughly 14,000 people and on Saturday, the PRCS said Israeli tanks were within 20 meters.

Nearly 11,200 people have died in Gaza, the majority women and children, according to figures released Sunday by health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave. The figures don’t distinguish between civilians and militants.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Placating Xi Won’t Change China’s Behavior,2023-11-12T21:29:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Thomas J. Duesterberg'],"In an article previewing President Biden’s meeting with China’s Xi Jinping this week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. has “a pragmatic economic strategy: one that protects our vital national security interests while seeking a stable and healthy economic relationship” with Beijing. But in the perilous and fast-changing world of late 2023, Beijing doesn’t seem interested in that sort of balance. From supporting other authoritarians’ military efforts to trying to displace the U.S.-led global financial system, Mr. Xi is undermining the security of America and its allies. But China’s weakening economy offers an opportunity to win meaningful changes in Beijing’s policies. It will take a hard-line approach to get China’s attention.

Mr. Xi certainly won’t be soft in negotiations. He knows two major wars have sapped America’s diplomatic and military resources—in part because of China’s efforts.

Mr. Xi has tried to create an alternative to the Western financial and economic system created by the Bretton Woods Agreement. A major component of Beijing’s program is undermining the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency and principal medium of global payments. That system—in combination with Western dominance of high-tech industries—allows the U.S. and allies to enforce sanctions.

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

To become more economically self-sufficient and immune from Western financial pressure, Beijing has worked on its own financial and economic system. The Brics grouping—which also includes Brazil, Russia, India and, as of recently, Iran—intends to displace the dollar by settling inter-Brics trade in local currencies. China also has agreements with various Middle Eastern nations to settle trade in local currencies. Beijing tries to do so through its Cross-Border Interbank Payment System.

China has also become the world’s largest provider of development finance, thanks to its Belt and Road Initiative and, to a lesser degree, to the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. In conjunction with this, China has focused its trade expansion on Brics nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Council, a group of eight full members and 10 observers and partners. Total Chinese exports to countries involved in Belt and Road now exceed those to the U.S., European Union, and Japan.

These efforts have yielded international political clout, which China has used to undermine U.S. interests. The Financial Times reported that between 2013 and 2020 Belt and Road nations voted with the Chinese position at the United Nations 75% of the time.

More ominous, China’s economic and financial reach have already allowed it to bypass Western sanctions and materially support authoritarian regimes. The U.S. organization United Against Nuclear Iran in 2022 accused six Chinese banks—including the world’s largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China—of complicity in illicit trade with Iran. Though that matter was seemingly never investigated by U.S. authorities, ICBC has been fined for money-laundering-related offenses by the U.S., U.K., Spain and Canada.

The headline program for China’s anti-Western financial system is the purchase and processing of oil and gas from Russia and Iran. China is estimated to be buying more than a million barrels of oil a day each from Iran and Russia, much of it in violation of various Western sanctions. China purchases this fuel at below market price, which aids its growing manufacturing dominance and economic power.

China is also aiding weapons production in Russia and Iran. In March, the U.S. imposed sanctions on five Chinese suppliers for selling drone components, while Politico in April reported that China was in talks with Russia and Iran to replenish Tehran’s supply of chemicals for rocket fuel. China and Hong Kong are major sources for Western semiconductors flowing to Russia in violation of sanctions.

In light of all this, it’s vital that Mr. Biden discuss new U.S. programs to counter China’s mercantilism, its drive to displace American leadership in the world, and, most important, to impose sanctions on China for its support of Russian and Iranian aggression. Straight talk from Washington will get Mr. Xi’s attention.

Mr. Xi desperately needs relief from Western sanctions, tariffs and investment restrictions to prop up China’s faltering economy. China is suffering from demographic decline, rural poverty, ecological stress, underdeveloped social services and youth unemployment. Yet Beijing can’t rely on government stimulus or consumer-led recovery as it has in past economic crises. Local governments provide 86% of public expenditures in China but their financing vehicles are horribly overleveraged. Banks are too, and that combined with falling returns on capital investment and the collapse of the real-estate sector leave few options for an investment- or demand-led rebound.

When Messrs. Biden and Xi meet, the latter will undoubtedly offer rhetorical support for cooperation on climate change and better access to Chinese markets in return for substantial reductions in U.S. tariffs, export controls and investment restrictions. Those will be empty promises, as in the past. In September 2020, China promised to begin reducing carbon emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. In January 2020, Beijing said it would increase U.S. imports under the Phase I trade agreement with the Trump administration. Neither happened. In fact, for all the Biden White House’s attempts to slow carbon output internationally, China’s chief climate negotiator in September said that phasing out fossil fuels is “unrealistic.”

Carrots have never worked with Beijing. Fortunately, at least four sticks are available to Mr. Biden.

First, Washington should find and impose sanctions on the banks laundering China’s illicit purchases of Iranian and Russian oil. The administration has been hesitant to do so, likely because of its nuclear-deal negotiations with Iran and China’s reputation for retaliation. It’s clear pandering hasn’t worked.

Second, Mr. Biden ought to revive a U.S. TikTok ban on the grounds of simple reciprocity—U.S. social media platforms don’t operate freely in China—and security concerns. The Justice Department is investigating TikTok for allegedly spying on U.S. citizens, including journalists, even as the platform gains popularity in America.

Third, the president should indicate to Mr. Xi that his administration would oppose any Treasury or Federal Reserve dollar relief to China if its faltering financial system suffers a shortage. China’s banks and many foreign investors lavished dollar-denominated loans on Chinese real estate and Belt and Road recipients. Seventy-five percent of China’s Belt and Road loans are in dollars, and these loans are at distress levels not seen since the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s.

Finally, Mr. Biden ought to inform Mr. Xi that he will expand investment restrictions more broadly to American portfolio investments in any Chinese firm subject to sanctions by the U.S. or its allies.

Perhaps such straight talk at a time of growing domestic problems will induce Mr. Xi to rethink at least his support for Russia and Iran. It’s clear that concessions won’t do the job.

America’s Universities Need Serious Regulation,2023-11-12T21:28:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Arthur Levitt'],"Americans who are rightfully appalled by the pusillanimous response to anti-Semitism on college campuses have been pulling their donations and calling for restrictions on anti-Israel student groups. Maybe those tactics will work. But in my experience, if you want real change in large and unwieldy organizations, you need to focus on fixing governance and assigning personal accountability. You need to regulate.

After the accounting scandals of the dot-com and Enron era, Congress passed laws requiring auditors to tighten their operations, establish clear boundaries between their consulting and audit businesses, and assume far more accountability than they had before.

Directors, too, were informed that they bore a personal interest in preventing fraud. One rule made it clear that if a company passed fraudulent numbers off to investors, the person who signed the filing—usually the chairman—would be personally liable.

Lawmakers have also tightened anti-money-laundering statutes, requiring banks to review their customers closely and to ensure they aren’t unwittingly providing services to organized crime, terror entities, tax evaders or other bad actors. The rules are difficult to enforce and require a lot of work. But they come with real penalties for failure: Bank officers can go to prison if they fail to prevent money laundering, and several have.

Think of the difference this makes. When Russia invaded Ukraine, America’s banks and other multinational corporations quickly had to implement sanctions—including anti-money-laundering rules—on Russia’s government, politicians, financial institutions, oligarchs and others who make up the country’s elite. This happened effectively because people had real skin in the game: their own.

Which brings us back to campus. Clearly, America’s universities are in need of similar encouragement.

Universities have lately seen a raft of scandals related to their fundamental mission of scholarship and teaching. Students are graduating unprepared for basic work and deeply in debt. Prominent scholars are found to be fudging their own research. Admissions officers and other officials are found to be engaging in pay-for-admission schemes. Athletic programs are regularly found breaking rules and laws. Universities have taken charitable gifts from questionable sources such as Jeffrey Epstein and Chinese military and Communist Party fronts.

Add the explosion of anti-Semitism. America’s campuses are the source of some of the vilest Jew-hatred America has seen since 1939, when the German American Bund held a pro-Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden. Not only do some faculty and students call for Israel’s destruction; they celebrated Hamas’s brutal massacre as an act of “resistance.”

If public companies featured such systematic failures, they would be visited by regulators and called before Congress. Universities, by comparison, are lightly regulated. There are accrediting agencies, and the Education Department focuses on enforcement of civil-rights laws. In the case of professional education, some membership organizations set curricular standards.

But these don’t constitute regulation in a comprehensive sense. Universities can pretty much set their own rules, and they answer to no one. They face no meaningful external pressure to tell the truth or honor their promises to students and others. They don’t need to report or punish fraud or corruption. They don’t set consistent standards for contributions or spending.

None of this is acceptable. Not to students and parents. Not to alumni and donors. And not to taxpayers, who subsidize universities to the tune of $1 trillion a year. The public has a clear interest in how these institutions operate and deserve to know how they became hotbeds of anti-Semitism.

Imagine what a difference it would make if universities were subject to the same kind of regulatory oversight the Securities and Exchange Commission provides to public companies. Administrators would have to meet basic standards of truthfulness and governance or face stiff financial penalties and sanctions, including permanent bans from working in higher education. If criminal acts were discovered, the Justice Department would step in.

When I led the SEC, I often spoke about my duty to the investing public. I said every public corporation needs to be trusted, and all should treat their investors with respect. Someone who breaks that trust should pay the price—including with time in prison.

Given what we are seeing on college campuses, it is time to impose the same standard on universities, their managers and their directors and trustees. It may be the only way to save them.

Israel Rebuffs Calls for Palestinian Authority to Rule Gaza,2023-11-12T17:21:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Anat Peled In Tel Aviv', 'Benoit Faucon In Ramallah', 'West Bank', 'Rory Jones In Dubai', 'Anat Peled', 'In Tel Aviv', 'In Ramallah', 'In Dubai']","Israel is diverging from the U.S. and Arab world on a postwar solution for Gaza, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out a role for the Palestinian Authority, which Washington and some Arab leaders prefer to take over from Hamas.

Netanyahu, under pressure from his right-wing political base, said Saturday Israel wants a solution other than the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas . The Israeli leader didn’t put forward an alternative, saying only that Israel wants to avoid governing Gaza and needs to maintain security control over the strip after it defeats Hamas, which Netanyahu has sworn to do.

The U.S. has said that it prefers an “effective and revitalized” Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank, as the solution for governance and security control in Gaza.

Arab and Muslim leaders, gathered in Saudi Arabia Saturday, endorsed in a draft declaration the Palestine Liberation Organization, the body overseeing the Palestinian Authority, as “the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.”

Netanyahu said Sunday on CNN that “a civilian authority has to cooperate in two goals. One is to demilitarize Gaza, and the second is to de-radicalize Gaza. And I have to say that the Palestinian Authority has unfortunately failed on both counts.”

Israel’s stance, increasingly at odds with the international community, reflects tensions within Israel over the Palestinian Authority and Netanyahu’s limited room to maneuver in his coalition government.

Going into the war, he held a four-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, and his position is dependent on far-right coalition partners who signal that they want to establish Jewish communities in Gaza and control it, rather than hand it to the Palestinian Authority.

“It’s all about political survival,” Mitchell Barak, a political analyst at Jerusalem-based Keevoon Global Research, said of Netanyahu’s approach to the Palestinian Authority and Gaza. “He hasn’t articulated his plan or his vision,” because he’s trying to appease the far-right, added Barak, who was an aide to Netanyahu in the 1990s.

The prime minister’s foreign-policy adviser, Ophir Falk, said that Israel’s strategy is to free Gaza from Hamas and ensure the Palestinian enclave is demilitarized and deradicalized. “In such a way that children are not taught to hate and worshipers are not taught in mosques to murder Jews,” he said, adding that only then could Gaza be rebuilt.

To be sure, Israel hasn’t defeated Hamas yet, which could take months, if Israel succeeds. Its military has largely sealed off northern Gaza and its soldiers are currently engaged in intense fighting around Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital. The military has said it has killed dozens of midlevel Hamas military commanders, but it has so far failed to take out any senior leaders—its stated goal.

Israel is also facing growing calls for a cease-fire. According to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave, Israel’s offensive has killed over 11,000 people in Gaza, the majority of them women and children. The figures don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. At least 44 Israeli soldiers have been killed in combat in Gaza since the ground incursion began late last month, according to the Israeli military.

Netanyahu’s rejection of the Palestinian Authority could eventually have less impact, given that many political analysts say he may not remain in power when Gaza’s postwar order comes into clearer focus.

Israelis are angry at his perceived failure to prevent the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that sparked the current conflict in Gaza, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed. He is facing criticism for his handling of the war and failure, so far, to return around 239 hostages that Israel says are being held in the strip.

Members of Netanyahu’s Likud party have privately said he is unlikely to remain as leader after the war.

“There are too many unknowns to make predictions or to take anything Bibi says too seriously,” said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a professor of political science at Israel’s Reichman University, using Netanyahu’s nickname.

Still, the growing rift between the U.S. and Netanyahu over the Palestinian Authority illustrates wariness among many Israelis over its viability as a partner for security. The authority was formed during a peace process in the 1990s to govern Gaza and parts of the West Bank on an interim basis, ahead of a long-term peace agreement that never materialized.

Some on Israel’s far right have advocated re-establishing Jewish settlements in Gaza, known in Hebrew as Gush Katif, rather than allowing the Palestinian Authority to return. The Palestinian Authority governed Gaza until 2007, when Hamas wrested control in a fight with the Palestinian faction Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority. Israel withdrew from settlements in Gaza in 2005.

Israeli singer Hanan Ben Ari was filmed singing “let’s return to Gush Katif” on a military base, and photos and videos of soldiers in uniform calling to restore settlements have surfaced on social media. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads a far-right party, thanked the prime minister Sunday for his statement opposing the Palestinian Authority.

Other Israelis are skeptical of the idea. “There are voices saying let’s go back and rule Gaza. I don’t think this has broad public legitimacy,” said lawmaker Ze’ev Elkin of the National Unity Party, currently in the government’s wartime coalition. “These are voices from particular factions on the extreme Israeli right.”

The head of the opposition, Yair Lapid, in an interview on Israel’s public broadcaster last week, said the Palestinian Authority is the only body capable of ruling Gaza after the war. “The prime minister is not stating what is reasonable—that the Palestinian Authority will have to be brought back,” he said. Netanyahu, he added, “is trapped by the extremists.”

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has also stressed the importance of cooperating with the Palestinian Authority’s security forces in the restive West Bank. Since Oct. 7, Israeli raids have increased in the West Bank in an attempt to root out Hamas there, resulting in more violent clashes and a rising number of Palestinian deaths, which Israel says are mostly militants.

Yet some in the coalition who are considered more moderate also dismiss the Palestinian Authority, saying it is unable to control the West Bank and so would be unable to control Gaza. They also say that the Palestinian Authority pays Palestinians who attack Israelis and has yet to condemn the Oct. 7 attacks. The authority says it provides financial aid to families of imprisoned Palestinians.

“I think it will be suicidal,” Likud lawmaker Yuli Edelstein said of a Palestinian Authority role in Gaza. He acknowledged the disagreement with the U.S. about the future of Gaza but said it was important to have “a serious discussion” and not automatically accept the “obvious” solution of the Palestinian Authority.

He said instead an international solution including Arab countries should be found.

So far, no authority other than Israel has volunteered to play a security role in Gaza during a transition to local rule by the Palestinian Authority or another Palestinian leadership. The draft communiqué of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation called for a revival of a Saudi-led proposal, first put forward in 2002, for a two-state solution.

Abbas, the Palestinian leader, has indicated he is willing to take control of Gaza with the Palestinian Authority if Israel engages in talks about a long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Presidential adviser Mahmoud Habbash said Netanyahu’s statements dismissing the Palestinian Authority role in Gaza were radical. “He is taking a drastic decision to continue the conflict,” Habbash told The Wall Street Journal.

Ahead of the war, Abbas’s approval rating among Palestinians was at about 20% and has likely fallen further, said Khalil Shikaki, head of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.

The 87-year-old Palestinian leader’s standing has diminished because of his perceived security and economic coordination with Israel, which has prolonged Israel’s occupation of territories that Palestinians want for a future state, particularly in the West Bank.

Ghassan Khatib, a lecturer at Birzeit University in the West Bank, said the Palestinian leader has few options other than to call for long-term peace negotiations. An arrangement in Gaza like Abbas currently oversees in the West Bank, where Israel manages security, and controls roads, borders and parts of the economy, would make him even more unpopular, he said.

“If he would say yes, then he would be dragged into a situation in Gaza that is even worse than the situation he is in in the West Bank,” said Khatib. “This is suicide.”

Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital Goes Dark at Center of Israel-Hamas Battle Zone,2023-11-11T11:55:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Omar Abdel-Baqui', 'David S. Cloud', 'Chao Deng', 'Margherita Stancati']","Israeli forces said they were engaged in fierce fighting Saturday around Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital, where Israel says Hamas has positioned fighters near thousands of displaced people and hundreds of patients amid worsening conditions at the facility.

Hospital officials said that doctors at Al-Shifa were using scant remaining medical supplies to treat wounded people, that the hospital was largely operating without electricity and water was running desperately low.

Doctors, including staff at Doctors Without Borders still inside Al-Shifa, said they saw people being shot at as they attempted to flee the hospital on Saturday. People have been unable to move between buildings and doctors say they can’t see who is firing.

“The situation is very, very dangerous,” said Marwan Abusada, a surgeon in the intensive-care unit.

Abusada said a hospital maintenance engineer was walking inside the hospital overnight when he was shot in the neck and paralyzed, while another man was shot when standing near a window, he said. Abusada also said a blast left a hole in the ICU building.

The hospital complex in recent days has become a focal point of the Israeli military’s movements in Gaza. Israel contends that under the complex is a Hamas command center with underground bunkers, a claim Hamas has denied. A senior Israeli official said there might be hostages held under the hospital, complicating the military’s ability to operate there.

Israeli military officials said on Saturday that the east side of the hospital complex remained open and that the Israel Defense Forces could coordinate with any who wanted to leave safely. The officials denied reports that Israel was surrounding and attacking the hospital. “There is no shooting at the hospital and there is no siege,” said Israeli Col. Moshe Tetro.

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari blamed Hamas militants for engaging in firefights near the hospital, where he said Israel is targeting them in a “precise manner.”

Israel is under international pressure to prevent mounting civilian deaths and ease the deteriorating conditions in hospitals and other facilities. Analysts say the broader Israeli strategy is to kill enough Hamas fighters and leaders to destroy the organization, while Hamas’s goal is a stalemate that will enable it to survive, damaged but still a force in Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that “Hamas has, in effect, lost control of the northern Gaza Strip.”

The U.S. is backing Israel’s goal of eliminating Hamas, and Israeli officials say they won’t accept a cease-fire or even a formal pause in fighting without a release of hostages abducted in Hamas’s attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. There are an estimated 239 hostages held in Gaza, according to Israeli officials.

Thousands of people remained at the Al-Shifa complex on Saturday, including roughly 600 patients and 300 medical staff, Abusada said. Most of the more than 50,000 people who had been sheltering at the hospital complex fled on Friday after blasts killed several people, doctors and families said.

Ahmed Mokhallalati, another surgeon at Al-Shifa, said no one was able to safely enter or leave the hospital Saturday amid gunfire and explosions. “It’s unsafe to move between the buildings,” he said.

He said the staff was still trying to proceed with lifesaving surgeries, with an anesthesia machine plugged into one corner of the hospital that had electricity.

The hospital is completely out of fuel and running only on a bit of solar power, said Abusada. Health officials said four patients in the ICU and a newborn in a unit for premature babies had died because of the lack of power. Medical staff were performing manual artificial respiration for hours on some of the 37 babies in the unit, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

Hagari said Israeli personnel were in touch with hospital staff to arrange the transfer of babies from the hospital, at the request of the staff. Doctors have warned that any evacuation would endanger patients as fighting gripped the area.

Tetro, the Israeli colonel, said he was in touch with the director of Al-Shifa Hospital, Mohamed Abu Salmiya, about evacuating remaining medical personnel, but Salmiya said any evacuation would need the aid of the Red Cross, United Nations or other international groups.

Around 100 bodies are decomposing out in the open, after people at the hospital tried unsuccessfully to dig a mass grave to bury them, according to a health official and Abusada. The bodies can’t be refrigerated because of the lack of fuel, and digging equipment was struck as it was en route to the hospital, said the doctor.

Israel, which repeatedly told Palestinians to evacuate the hospitals in Gaza, made another call for civilians to move south of the main fighting zone Saturday, issuing a map urging residents to move along a north-south road near the coast that passes close to Al-Shifa Hospital. Israel said 200,000 people have fled northern Gaza since Thursday.

“We have been calling for civilians to evacuate for four weeks now, while Hamas did everything in its capability to prevent civilians from leaving in order to keep them as human shields,” an Israeli spokesman said. “We will keep trying to mitigate between civilians and the terrorists, but it is Hamas’s strategy to prevent us from doing so.”

Israeli forces were closing in on another hospital complex in northern Gaza, Al-Quds, which is sheltering 14,000 people, according to Palestine Red Crescent Society, the hospital’s operator. It said Israeli tanks were 20 meters away.

At Al-Rantisi Hospital, a children’s facility in Gaza, Israeli forces in recent days allowed a mass evacuation of people, including at least half a dozen Hamas fighters, according to Israeli military officials.

Before the evacuation, gunmen were inside the hospital and in some cases prevented civilians and patients from exiting, said an operations officer for the Israeli military’s Givati Brigade. Israeli troops considered using snipers to target the militants but decided it would have caused panic, he said.

“We saw them. We identified them and we let them leave because we did not want the risk to the civilians,” the officer said.

The Israel Defense Forces released a recording of a call with an Al-Rantisi Hospital administrator in which an Israeli officer said that evacuees should wave a white cloth and raise their arms so soldiers would know they were unarmed.

Even when the evacuation was under way, gunmen were shooting at civilians “in order to scare them back in,” the officer said. People left in ambulances, on foot and in wheelchairs, he said.

Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said the Hamas operative who had led the group’s forces at the Al-Rantisi Hospital was later killed at a school building. The military identified him as Ahmed Siam, a company commander in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighborhood.

The Israeli officers declined to say whether Al-Rantisi had been fully evacuated and was under Israeli control.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Israeli Control Is the Least Bad Option in Gaza,2023-11-10T23:40:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Dovid Efune'],"I visited Israel in late August 2005. It was a hot summer, and the political turmoil of the day made it hotter still. The Jewish state was in the throes of one of its more tortured sagas: the self-imposed and forced removal of its citizens from the Gaza Strip.

The country was bitterly divided, not for the first or last time. The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had lost its majority and the confidence of his Likud Party’s rank-and-file. Forming a new party, Kadima, he joined with dovish opposition leader Shimon Peres and secured the required support for his “disengagement plan.” Among the plan’s opponents was then-Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who resigned from the government after his demand for a national referendum went unmet.

Mr. Netanyahu is now the prime minister tasked with responding to the most devastating terrorist attack in Israel’s history, which Hamas launched from the territory Israel vacated in 2005. On Monday Mr. Netanyahu returned to the question of Gaza’s governance. His remarks came as the Israel Defense Forces moved to reclaim control of the strip from Hamas, pushing deep into the 140-square-mile territory. Israeli forces have cut the north from the south and encircled Gaza City, and are closing in on the command base at Shifa hospital, where they believe Hamas leadership is bunkered.

“I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, have the overall security responsibility, because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t,” Mr. Netanyahu told ABC News.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken shot back on Wednesday. There should be “no reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends,” he said, speaking from the Group of Seven summit in Japan. Other conditions, he said, include no “attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza” and no “reduction of the territory of Gaza.” Last week Mr. Blinken told the Senate Appropriations Committee of his hopes for a “revitalized” Palestinian Authority governing Gaza after Israel concludes its military campaign.

For the Israelis, this is déjà vu. The Palestinian Authority assumed control after the 2005 pullout, only to be ousted in a violent coup by Hamas two years later. The Israelis can’t be asked to roll the dice again. The Gaza exit failed to deliver either the public-relations or national-security benefits that its proponents promised in 2005. Instead the strip became a launchpad for death and destruction. There’s no reason to believe a do-over would produce different or better results.

Mr. Netanyahu has long been skeptical of vacating land that could be seized by terrorists. In his 1995 book, “Fighting Terrorism,” he notes that terror organizations such as Hamas are at their deadliest when they are “exceptionally well trained,” are “well funded and equipped,” and occupy a “safe haven.” Three of Israel’s borders—with Lebanon, Syria and Gaza—are now controlled by terror ministates wherein each of these conditions are amply met. In the case of Gaza and southern Lebanon, terrorists have flourished in territories the IDF once controlled.

After the Oct. 7 attack, which many Israelis now refer to as the “Black Sabbath,” a video from 2005 began circulating on social-media channels. In it, Sodi Namir—a physician from Neve Dekalim, a former Israeli settlement in Gaza—is seen raging as he’s dragged by IDF soldiers executing the disengagement. “A million murders will come,” he bellows. “Rockets on Ashkelon. Mortars on Sderot. Murders in Netivot. You are all partners in this crime. Nothing will stop it. This is exactly what will happen. All headlines will be disasters.” To Israelis, the words now ring prophetic.

Gazans have also been devastated by the 2005 pullout. Hamas has led them to five wars against their far stronger neighbor. It has plundered nearly every resource of the coastal enclave. Gaza’s hospitals house Hamas military bases. Its schools are indoctrination and recruitment centers. Its playgrounds are missile launchpads. Its children are human shields. When Israel administered Gaza in the 1970s, by contrast, its economy grew at a compound annual rate of 8.5%, according to a 2013 analysis by Netanya Academic College economist Andrew Schein.

At the G-7 parlay on Wednesday, British Foreign Minister James Cleverly added that he’d like to see control of Gaza handed to “a peace-loving Palestinian leadership.” The idea, for now, is a fantasy. After a generation of indoctrination, it will take decades to reverse the culture of hate that Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have meticulously cultivated.

It’s time the international community recognizes what many Israelis and some Gazans have already learned. For the foreseeable future, Israeli control of Gaza will bring the best possible outcome for the beleaguered civilian populations of the region—both Arab and Israeli.

The Scenes of Genocide I Saw in Israeli Morgues,2023-11-10T22:25:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Qanta A. Ahmed'],"A fetal heartbeat flutters and then stills, a bullet lodged in the embryonic heart. The mother survives the shooting and her child’s stillbirth. A body that has been decomposing for almost three weeks lies on the autopsy table, riddled with knife and bullet wounds. Another is nearby, the man’s bluetooth receiver still clipped onto his shirt. Death came as a surprise.

This is Israel. I arrived on Oct. 19 to spend 10 days as a human-rights observer with the permission of the nation’s Foreign Affairs Ministry and help from Israel Defense Forces officer Kobi Valer. As an observant Muslim, I felt a duty to come and bear witness. What I saw will remain with me forever.

Hamas waged its attacks in the nation’s south, but hundreds of its victims have since been moved north. I encountered many of them at the morgues at the Shura military base near Ramle, some 15 miles southeast of Tel Aviv. I toured the Sammy Ofer Fortified Underground Emergency Hospital in Haifa, visiting the neonatal units whose tiny patients had recently been relocated in anticipation of further conflict. I examined bodies and ashes, incinerated teeth and bones. I saw toddlers, teens and adults, young and old, many of them bound, tortured and burned alive.

One word continually came to mind: genocide. No matter how it emerges, the monster is easy to recognize. As a doctor, I had a rare and panoramic view of the aftermath: the targeted people’s long, agonizing journey to death.

This isn’t the first time I have seen Islamist jihadism or even Islamist genocide. I’ve been to northwestern Pakistan and met child Taliban operatives groomed for suicide missions. I still attend to 9/11 first-responders in New York. I’ve been to post-ISIS Iraq to meet with Kurdish and Yazidi survivors of genocide. I’ve spoken with former ISIS child soldiers and the Peshmerga veterans of that brutal and bloody three-year war.

The Oct. 7 genocide was different, more barbaric than anything before it. The attacks were cloaked in the language and metaphors of Islam, yet corrupted with cosmic enmity for the Jewish people, Judaism, global Jewry and the Jewish state. They revealed again that Islamism is a virulent impostor of Islam with intentions anathema to the faith. And there was no doubt of Islamism’s guilt: I saw real-time footage generated by the Hamas commandos’ own

cameras. I heard phone calls exclaiming the Shahadah—the Islamic declaration of faith—as they murdered, executed, burned, pillaged and then broadcast their crimes.

There is a commonality I have found in the face of such destruction. People struggle to find the words to describe what happened. Israelis I met were still searching for how to recount their experiences. Some talked about a second Shoah, a second Holocaust. One Israeli detective disagreed: “We can’t call this a holocaust—not because of the numbers—but because the Nazis were systematic and institutionalized the killing, and we can’t call it carnage, because ‘carnage’ is too nice a word.” He looked at me with a painful gaze. I found my own words strangled in silence, except one: genocide.

Article 6 of the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines genocide as a crime against humanity in terms identical to the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Its essential element is intent “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”

The Oct. 7 attack was premeditated, organized and targeted, seeking to destroy as many Israelis as possible. Hamas tortured and immolated its victims, including children, pregnant women and the unborn. Its men intentionally captured hostages, around 240 in total, reportedly from more than 40 countries.

They had intent. Eyewitnesses told me the terrorists came with tablets loaded with maps of the kibbutzim, blueprints and floor plans of homes, names of families and specific knowledge of service records and where Israeli veterans were living. Others told me that some of the terrorists spoke Hebrew and lured the unwitting out of their safe rooms into certain death.

This wasn’t like the pogroms of the 1880s, a frenzy of killing with rabid emotion. This was a methodically planned genocide. No such circumstances apply to Israel’s operation in Gaza, and so the description must not be the same. The sovereign state of Israel is destroying Hamas because Hamas is threatening Israel, which is working to mitigate civilian losses. The country has a duty to prevent further genocide against its people. Saying so doesn’t detract from the suffering of Palestinians who are captives of Hamas.

Two weeks after the attack, Queen Rania of Jordan suggested that the butchering of children had yet to be “independently verified” as I examined images of their remains in Ramle. The deceit felt as barbaric as the atrocities. There is no context, no nuance, that justifies genocide. Its intention is the same throughout the ages: the destruction of a people.

Israel, the West and the Muslim world must respond with necessary moral clarity: Define the Oct. 7 attacks as genocide. Legally designating the horrors as such ought to become a priority, independent of the war against Hamas, because the attacks need to be documented and prosecuted as crimes against humanity. Doing so is a matter of Jewish survival. The world has been silent in the face of Jewish genocide before. When we now say never again, we must mean it.

The Theology of Hamas,2023-11-09T23:03:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Ed Husain'],"Hamas isn’t only a terrorist group, and it isn’t a Palestinian nationalist movement. It is a religious organization, incubated by the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood, founded in 1928, departed from Islamic tradition and created Islamism, a totalitarian ideology to resist the pluralist West.

Its worldview, as French political scientist Gilles Kepel has documented, arose in the same intellectual firmament as German Nazism and Italian fascism. The Brotherhood developed a new declaration of faith for its members: “God is our objective. The Prophet is our political leader. The Quran is our constitution. Jihad is our method. Martyrdom is our aspiration.” No Muslim before the 20th century would have belittled his faith’s sacred text by regarding it as a political manifesto.

When Ahmed Yassin left Al-Azhar University in Cairo and founded Hamas in Gaza in 1987, the group’s members placed their hands on the Quran and declared: “I promise to be a good Muslim in defending Islam and the lost land of Palestine.” Theology is central to Hamas’s charter, which declares that “Islam will destroy Israel” and that because “Palestine is an Islamic land,” it is the “individual duty of every Muslim” to liberate it. Hamas calls “the land of Palestine” a waqf, an Islamic endowment. These teachings would have been alien to Muslims who coexisted with Jews for 12 centuries.

Hamas envisages a future Palestine that is judenrein, or cleansed of Jews. Article 7 of its charter declares: “The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say, ‘O Muslims, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.’ ” That animus stems in part from its considering the Jews to be European colonialists, ignoring that they’re native to the land and that Islamic armies successfully colonized the Levant. Christians, whom Hamas views as part of the local Arab population, are treated less violently, but they don’t enjoy unfettered religious liberty.

Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahhar has said that Palestine is only a “toothbrush in our pocket.” Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood aspire to create a regionwide Shariah state, a more anti-Western confrontational caliphate in line with Iran’s political model than that of moderate Arab nations in the neighborhood. That intention has led several Arab nations—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt—to ban both groups from organizing within their borders. In 1979 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat signed a peace agreement with Israel. Two years later Islamists assassinated him.

Hamas’s theology justifies its terrorism. “The so-called peace process is futile,” Hamas leader Khaled Mashal said in 2015. “There is no peace. Only the path of jihad, sacrifice and blood.” Hamas calls its terror faction the al-Qassam Brigades, after the Syrian cleric Izzaddin al-Qassam, who attacked Jews living in kibbutzim in the 1930s. On Oct. 7, the brigade killed more than 1,400 in southern Israel in an orgy of bestial violence. Britain eliminated Izzaddin al-Qassam in 1935, and Israel will kill Hamas fighters today. Yet both are known as criminals and murderers only to the sane and sensible. To Hamas and its flock, the terrorists are known as martyrs and believed to live in heaven.

After Sept. 11, 2001, moderate Muslim leaders declared that terrorists were in hell, not heaven; that they were murderers, not martyrs. Destroying Hamas will require advancing an alternate, more attractive worldview than that. Sheikh Abdullah bin Bayyah, among the highest authorities in global Sunni Islam, has used scriptural arguments against suicide bombings and made religious arguments for including Jews and Christians in Muslim societies. Fluent in French and Arabic, he draws on the writings of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau to explain how both were inspired by early Islamic scholars’ advocacy for human reason. So long as Muslims enjoy religious-liberty protections, the sheikh intones, they have no need for a caliphate or Islamic state. In this view, civil nation-states are legitimate Islamic governments.

That isn’t so far-fetched. As Secretary of State Antony Blinken shuttled across the Mideast last month, he visited the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, a multifaith structure that features a synagogue, mosque, church, all in one complex. The project seeks to embrace Jews as equals—as our forebears in faith. If after centuries such a model can exist in the U.A.E., it can exist in Jerusalem too.

Hamas Supporters Probably Aren’t Fit to Practice Law,2023-11-09T22:58:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Hadley Arkes'],"Dozens of law firms have signed an open letter to law-school deans warning that “anti-Semitic activities would not be tolerated at any of our firms.” Earlier, Davis Polk & Wardwell had said it was reconsidering job offers to three Ivy League students who held leadership positions with organizations that signed letters supporting Hamas’s assault on Israel, and Winston & Strawn withdrew an offer to a New York University student who called the atrocities “necessary.”

The letter calls on the schools to affirm “the values we all hold dear” and reject “unreservedly that which is antithetical to those values.” It asserts that “there is no room for anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism or any other form of violence, hatred or bigotry on your campuses, in our workplaces or our communities.” Weeks earlier the president of the University of Pennsylvania, jostled by donors into saying something emphatic, picked up the same script and said that “hateful speech that denigrates others” is “contrary to our values.”

But are the “values” of Sullivan & Cromwell the same as the “values” of Kirkland & Ellis, or of the University of Pennsylvania? Is there nothing in the distinct character of these institutions that can produce a moral response with edge and substance? The term “value judgment” came to us through Nietzsche and Max Weber, when people lost their confidence in speaking of moral truths and began to speak rather of the things they happened to “value,” which may not be what others “value.”

It was hardly controversial for the law firms to denounce “hatred or bigotry.” But what is it exactly that the law firms are enjoining the universities to do? The firms would doubtless assure the schools that they are against interfering with the freedom of the demonstrators to assemble and to speak.

For their own part, the students would assert that there is nothing anti-Semitic in their critique. What they are condemning, they say, is the “suffocating occupation of the Palestinian people.” At that point the law firms would have to step away from the woolly affirmation of “values” to challenge the demonstrators on the substance of their claims. They would have to ask questions like these:

If Hamas is engaged in “resistance,” what is the wrong that the students think finds an apt and proportionate response in the kidnapping of grandmothers and the beheading of children?

The protesters inveigh against an Israeli “occupation” and the imposition of colonial “imperialism.” That has the moral resonance of charging that people are being ruled without their consent, without free elections. But Palestinians are governed by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority without free elections. Why aren’t they seeking to overthrow those regimes?

What do the protesters mean by “occupation”? There’s a confusion between the term’s military sense and the simple sense in which Jews “occupy,” or live in, Israel. Hamas’s objective evidently is to remove them from that land—or from the land of the living.

Is there a legal dispute over who has a right to govern this territory? That would bring accounts surprising to many people of who settled and developed the different parts of Palestine first. That is a dispute that lends itself to evidence presented in a forum that would be trusted to sift through the facts and form a judgment.

But that isn’t the point being made in a brutal armed assault. An assault brings no “brief” or argument; it carries its own meaning as an appeal to brute force. If that sets the terms of the engagement, the matter has been placed beyond moral reasoning altogether; it is marked by the principle that might makes right. That the Israelis have borne the sacrifices and fought successfully to preserve their independence in three major wars now may be quite enough to show, on these terms, that they have paid the price to live in this territory they have developed and won.

However the argument is played out, these are the lines on which it is most likely to run in any serious challenge. That it isn’t taking place now in the most prestigious colleges reflects what has changed so markedly in colleges that used to take themselves seriously.

But one would think that these reasoned challenges would spring forth from people who have made their vocation in law. A graduate of a law school who hasn’t thought along these lines in explaining his judgments—or a student who begins by not respecting the difference between innocence and guilt—has evidently wandered into the wrong profession. It isn’t that he is unsuited to work at Kirkland & Ellis, but that he is unfit to practice law.

Israel-Gaza Debate Causes Chaos at Oakland School-Board Meeting,2023-11-09T15:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Christine Mai-Duc'],"Some advocated pro-Palestinian themes as a school board meeting got under way Wednesday in Oakland, Calif.

OAKLAND, Calif.—The worldwide debate over the war between Israel and Hamas caused a local school-board meeting to shut down here Wednesday night.

More than 150 people packed an auditorium at Oakland’s La Escuelita Elementary School in anticipation of a resolution that one board member planned to introduce calling for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Many people wore the green, red, black and white colors of the Palestinian flag and carried signs demanding “Ceasefire Now!” and criticizing Israel’s bombing campaign.

The board had scarcely embarked on its agenda, which included school-site improvements and enrollment issues, when a pro-Palestinian speaker’s microphone was cut off after his two minutes expired. When the man continued to talk, Mike Hutchinson, Oakland school-board president, announced a five-minute recess.

While Hutchinson and his colleagues remained seated, demonstrators chanted “Free Palestine!” and “Shame!” The school-board president then adjourned the meeting before the measure was formally introduced, as dozens of people were still waiting to speak.

In the largely progressive San Francisco Bay Area, other local governments and political organizations have already taken steps to condemn Israel’s actions, drawing praise from Palestinian supporters and accusations of antisemitism from Jewish groups—along with questions about why they are taking positions on a war on the other side of the world.

Two weeks ago, the East Bay city of Richmond passed a resolution that accused Israel of engaging in ethnic cleansing and collective punishment of civilians in Gaza. The local Democratic committee of Alameda County, home to Oakland, recently passed a resolution accusing the Israeli government of war crimes. San Francisco’s Democratic committee was set to consider a similar measure but delayed its vote after an outcry.

Zahra Billoo, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Bay Area office, said Richmond’s action “has inspired so much activism in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond, where people are approaching city councils, approaching school boards and unions as partners in this effort to lift up the call for a cease-fire.”

The Oakland Education Association, the city’s teachers union, released a statement in late October condemning the “75 year long illegal military occupation of Palestine” and accusing the Israeli government of creating an “apartheid state” and using “genocidal rhetoric and policies” against Palestinians.

The backlash was immediate, with educators threatening to leave the union and parents saying they were considering pulling their children from public schools.

District officials called the statement polarizing and hurtful and asked staff to encourage students to see the conflict as “profoundly complicated,” rather than taking a side.

Marc Levine, regional director for the Anti-Defamation League, said that the OEA had embraced Hamas’s talking points and that its statement was “offensive and isolating to Oakland’s Jewish community.”

OEA officials declined to comment.

The Oakland Education Association is one of the most politically active teachers unions in the country, and its statement on Gaza wasn’t the first time it had taken a stand on issues unrelated to working conditions for its members. During a strike last spring, the union demanded and won what it called “common good” provisions, including steps to build housing for homeless students and special support for schools with large Black populations as a form of reparations.

Last weekend, Oakland school-board member Valarie Bachelor submitted a resolution demanding the safe return of Israeli hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The resolution mourns the loss of civilian lives on both sides of the conflict, while citing “decades of displacement, occupation, oppression and blockade endured in Gaza and the West Bank.”

Bachelor said she drafted the resolution after she heard community members urge the district to take a stance on a war that affected families with relatives in the region and resonated with those who had escaped conflicts elsewhere.

“Sometimes we stay away from hot-topic issues because we’re scared,” she said. “But we need to be having these conversations.”

Hutchinson said before the meeting that he doesn’t think the board should get involved.

“I don’t think that the local school board needs to weigh in on world affairs,” he said. “I am a big believer in people fighting for what they believe in, but I don’t want the school board meetings to be that place.”

Some Oakland Unified School District parents and employees said they were upset that the school board and teachers-union leaders were spending time on global politics in a city struggling with falling enrollment and low test scores.

“This is a harmful distraction from really important work that this district should be doing,” said Megan Bacigalupi, an Oakland public-school parent who heads the advocacy group CA Parent Power.

Elementary schoolteacher Katherine Smetak said she plans to withdraw from the OEA because of its statement. “What a lot of members are proud of is that we stand with the oppressed…I just don’t know when it went international,” she said.

But Paloma Salazar, an Oakland Unified community school manager who doesn’t belong to the union, said she supports Bachelor’s resolution.

“What I am seeing is an uptick in Islamophobia and the rhetoric that Palestinian lives don’t matter,” she said. “Not addressing this would cause more harm than division.”

Hutchinson didn’t say at Wednesday’s meeting whether and when the board would vote on the cease-fire resolution.

But as a teary-eyed Bachelor spoke to supporters who milled about afterward, she promised to keep pushing for it.

“I’m sorry,” she told the crowd of people, who offered her hugs and chanted her name. “The fight continues.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Hamas Attack Reminds Europeans of the Virtue of Sovereignty,2023-11-09T18:13:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Joseph C. Sternberg'],"Europe has discovered that it has an anti-Semitism crisis on its hands. And now some politicians claim to have found the answer: Deport the anti-Semites. It’s a response as illuminating as it is futile.

The shock to Europe has been the “pro-Palestinian” protests on the streets in the weeks since Hamas’s barbaric invasion of Israel. Too often these degenerate into, if they don’t start out as, festivals of anti-Semitism and sympathy for Hamas. Germany and France have led the charge in attempting to ban such gatherings, with mixed success. In the U.K., the refusal of the authorities to do so has become deeply controversial.

This protest movement has been accompanied by an outbreak of anti-Semitic violence. Note that what’s new here is the purported shock of the political class and many voters that such things are happening. Anti-Semitic attitudes and acts have been increasing for some time, though too few acknowledged it.

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

Which raises the question: Why notice it now? Part of the answer is that after Oct. 7 the dire consequences of tolerating anti-Semitic activity have become impossible to ignore. Hamas’s brutality has taught cynical, world-weary Europe that the Continent still can be outraged by something.

The other part is that this crisis is feeding deeper anxieties Europeans have developed about their own states—and whether their governments are fit for purpose. Which is why the sudden talk of deportation is so noteworthy.

The backdrop is Europe’s migration crisis, to which the protests and the anti-Semitism have come to be linked in the public mind. In Britain this takes the form of a debate about how and why an alleged Hamas leader was granted British citizenship. The French public constantly is reminded that France is home to Europe’s largest populations of both Jews and Muslims, which can’t help but inspire the question of how so many poorly assimilated Muslim migrants and their descendants came to be living there.

In Germany, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the left-leaning Green Party last week released a video that decries rising anti-Semitism. Perhaps the strangest line to foreign ears came when he remarked without elaboration that some Jews told him they’re afraid to get into taxis. Anyone who has hailed a taxi in Germany knew what he meant: The drivers tend to be Muslim immigrants or their descendants.

All of which explains how the first policy response in parts of Europe has come to be: Kick them out. French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin was first out of the gate, demanding days after the Hamas invasion that France “immediately” expel foreigners who commit anti-Semitic acts.

More surprising, Mr. Habeck seems to agree. In his video, he suggested Germany’s government should deny residency privileges to migrants who espouse pro-Hamas or anti-Semitic views. Justice Minister Marco Buschmann of the free-market Free Democratic Party earlier last week pointedly suggested such people shouldn’t gain the right to vote in German elections.

In this way, the debate has become about the future of the European state as much as it is about the safety of Europe’s Jews or the defense of European values such as pluralism or tolerance—all of which turn out to be connected.

Many political thinkers in Europe in recent decades have held up a utopian vision of international governance that transcends countries’ sovereignty. That philosophy helped clear the way for the migrant crisis by training “right-thinking” European politicians to shun any concept of national borders as somehow racist—an expression of Europe’s worst historical instincts.

Many European voters were never fully on board with this, and now they really aren’t. They’ve discovered anew in recent weeks that national sovereignty, borders and all, can be a virtuous thing—the mechanism by which a society defends the best things about itself, including its values.

Hence the sudden clamor by worried politicians to deport migrants who hold undesirable views. These leaders are promising to use the state’s monopoly on violence to enforce social norms.

That’s the sine qua non of a state: the right, the means and the will to decide who may live freely within its borders and who may not. Too often Western states fail to do this—when they let criminals roam free rather than jailing them, or prove incapable of blocking illegal migration or vetting legal immigrants. Voters are fed up.

Will this exercise of state power work? Perhaps not. Much of the clash of values that worries Europeans arises not among the relatively new arrivals who can be returned to somewhere, but among their second- or third-generation Europe-born children who can’t be sent packing as easily.

Still, the debate is a start toward discussing how European states can defend their values. Voters have demanded this for some time as they’ve drifted further toward political fringes on the left or right that promise to defend national sovereignty. After Oct. 7, even Europe’s perennially aloof political class is starting to notice.

Boycotts and the Dangerous Logic of Complicity,2023-11-09T15:28:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"Sierra Dawn McClain is correct to rebuke the feckless Philadelphia politicians who refuse to condemn a call to boycott “Zionist” restaurants—really those owned or operated by Jews (“BDS Reaches The West Bank of the Delaware,” op-ed, Nov. 6). The Philly Palestine Coalition justifies its call to boycott by asserting the identical rationale used by those who justify Hamas’s violence on Oct. 7. It says the listed restaurants are “complicit” in an alleged “system of occupation and apartheid” and are therefore targets, just as Israeli civilians were said to be “complicit.” There is a threat of violence implicit in this call to economic warfare against small businesses.

While the Philly Palestine Coalition urges its followers to boycott restaurants, maybe it should also caution followers against using the following Israeli innovations: the flexible stent; the pressure bandage to stop hemorrhagic wound; Azilect, a medicine for Parkinson’s disease; Copaxone, an immunomodulator drug for treating multiple sclerosis; Taliglucerase alfa, a drug for treating Gaucher’s disease; engineered recombinant chimeric antigen receptors, used in immunotherapy for many cancers; Sambucol, an anti-influenza syrup; ENvue, a feeding tube placement system; and many more.

Please also be in contact with the 3,000 Palestinian children who have had lifesaving heart surgeries in Israeli hospitals, at no cost to the families, under the auspices of the Israeli organization Save a Child’s Heart.

One could reasonably expect the Philadelphia boycott to fare as well as the boycott of Goya Foods. In 2020, after Goya CEO Robert Unanue said some kind words about President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for a boycott. How did that turn out? Mr. Unanue reported that Goya had a record increase in sales. Talk about backlash.

I suspect many Philadelphia Jews and Gentiles who now know about this boycott will increase the demand for food at local Jewish-owned restaurants and other businesses as well.

"Notable & Quotable: Glenn Kessler, Joe Biden and Misinformation",2023-11-08T23:29:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"Washington Post “fact checker” Glenn Kessler writing on Nov. 1:

At an Oct. 25 White House news conference, a reporter began a question to Biden by noting that “the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed over 6,000 Palestinians, including 2,700 children.”

Biden’s dismissal of the ministry’s statistics—that he had “no confidence” in them—was striking. The State Department has regularly cited ministry statistics without caveats in its annual human rights reports. . . .

The president appeared to show excessive skepticism when he commented that he had “no confidence” in the Health Ministry’s figures and that he “had no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth” about the death toll. The Gaza Health Ministry has had a pretty good track record with its death estimates over the years, notwithstanding that it is part of the Hamas-run government, and Biden is in a position to know that.

The initial reports on the hospital strike attributed to the ministry do give pause, however."
Palestinians Flee Northern Gaza as Israel Tightens Siege,2023-11-08T11:52:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Jared Malsin', 'Dov Lieber', 'Anas Baba']","GAZA—Thousands of Palestinians are fleeing the besieged northern Gaza area, some carrying white flags or pushing wheelchairs, seeking safety from the advancing Israeli military.

The current exodus takes Israel one step closer to its aim of removing civilians from northern Gaza. Israel is urging all residents in the area, including Gaza City, to leave as it moves in to battle Hamas. Though hundreds of thousands have already fled, many have been unable or unwilling to leave, and are living with limited access to food and water.

Israeli officials say they are evacuating Gazans for their own safety and because their presence in Gaza City is one of the most complicated tactical challenges to toppling Hamas.

Israeli Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said around 50,000 Gazans fled northern Gaza to the south on Wednesday.

Hagari said that Israeli ground forces were active Wednesday in the heart of Gaza city, accompanied by air and naval forces.

“We will continue to pursue the Hamas leadership wherever it is and kill it,” he said.

Hagari lowered the number of known hostages in Gaza to 239 from 240, and said the number is being updated based on the latest intelligence.

Those leaving with their few belongings braved ongoing Israeli bombing and passed through Israeli military checkpoints. Fleeing civilians said that increasingly intense shelling and worsening conditions in the north drove them to leave.

“After last night, we thought, enough, that’s it,” said a woman at the southern entrance of Gaza with her husband and four children. She declined to give her name for her own safety. “There were bodies,” she said, describing their walk along the road south.

Behind her, a stream of people walked in the midday sun along the road from Gaza, some carrying a single bag.

“We lived through the hardest days imaginable,” said another woman who also declined to be named. “We left our house for an Unrwa school, thinking it would be a safe place, but it wasn’t safe. The school was hit, so we left for another school, and they hit the other school. So we went to a special center, and that got hit too.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday outlined U.S. expectations for postwar governance in Gaza, including Palestinian sovereignty over the territory, days after Israel said it intended to play a security role there after its overthrow of Hamas.

“The United States believes key elements should include no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Not now; not after the war. No use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks. No re-occupation of Gaza after the conflict ends,” Blinken told reporters following a Group of Seven ministerial meeting in Tokyo.

Israel is asking Palestinians to gather in what it calls a “humanitarian zone” in al-Mawasi, a stretch of beach with little infrastructure in the southern Gaza Strip, where Israeli officials said civilians can receive humanitarian aid brought over the border from Egypt.

“If you care about yourself and your loved ones, head south according to our instructions,” Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee tweeted on Wednesday in Arabic, posting a map pointing to al-Mawasi.

U.N. aid officials say the area is too small and too barren to accommodate Israel’s demand to set up camps for tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people. Senior U.N. officials called the exodus from northern Gaza an act of forced displacement, and have said that civilians should be allowed to remain where they live.

“This is a tiny area in an area that’s already amongst the most crowded on earth,” said Samuel Rose, director of planning at Unrwa, the agency serving Palestinian refugees, referring to al-Mawasi. “The idea that people could be funneled into a smaller area without facilities, without infrastructure, with literally nowhere else to go but into the sea is completely impractical.”

Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after the militant group’s attack that killed more than 1,400 Israelis on Oct. 7.

Health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say that more than 10,000 people have been killed there, most of them women and children. The figures don’t distinguish between militants and civilians.

The accelerated evacuation of civilians from Gaza City shows that Hamas can no longer control people who face starvation and lack of drinking water, in addition to airstrikes, said Ghaith Al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former Palestinian Authority official.

The evacuations aren’t a sign that Hamas is losing support and will reinforce the view in the Arab world that Israel is fighting Palestinians in general and not just Hamas, Omari said. The displacement of civilians will carry echoes of the flight of Palestinians from their homeland in 1948, in the war that followed the creation of Israel, he said. Palestinians refer to the displacement of people from that time as al-Nakba, the catastrophe.

“It may even feed the narrative that this is a second Nakba,” said Omari. “Even those who say Hamas made a mistake by starting it blame Israel for the way it’s conducting the war.”

Israel is intensifying pressure on those remaining in the north to leave, including thousands taking shelter in hospitals and schools. The remaining civilians have endured weeks without electricity and clean water and have been cut off from humanitarian aid deliveries for about a week. Bakeries aren’t producing bread in the area because they lack supplies, according to the U.N.

Dr. Bashar Murad, emergency medical services director at the Palestine Red Crescent Society, who is working at al-Quds hospital in Gaza City, said 14,000 people sheltering at the facility were in deep crisis after an Israeli airstrike hit the entrance of the building on Sunday, killing four people and destroying the hospital’s central storage for medicine and other supplies.

“We are facing the worst situation, the most catastrophic one in the PRCS’ history,” he said in a message shared with the Journal by the aid group Medical Aid for Palestinians.

“My family is now displaced in Khan Younis, and I stayed in Gaza as I cannot leave work in these circumstances.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
U.S. Sees Limits for Israel’s Place in Gaza Future,2023-11-08T19:21:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['William Mauldin', 'Vivian Salama']","The U.S. on Wednesday called for limits on Israel’s control over Gaza after its war with Hamas, sending a public message to Israeli officials about expectations for an expansive Palestinian role there.

Senior U.S. officials called for the Palestinian people to be at the center of governance in Gaza—unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described a vision for rebuilding Gaza and a path toward Israelis and Palestinians living side by side “in space of their own with equal measures of security, freedom, opportunity and dignity.”

Blinken said on the sidelines of a meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies that the U.S. objects to “forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.”

“No re-occupation of Gaza after the conflict ends, no attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza,” he said in Tokyo. “No reduction in the territory of Gaza.”

John Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, later said, “We believe that the Palestinians should be in charge of their future and they should be the determining voice and factor in their future.”

The U.S. officials’ new rhetoric shows how the Biden administration is grappling with some Israeli officials over the future of Gaza, even as the U.S. continues to support Israel’s current military operation there.

Blinken’s blueprint comes after a month of quiet discussions he and other officials have had with Israel and regional partners as well as leading global diplomats. The comments are a signal to the Arab world that the U.S. isn’t only worried about Israel’s security.

While both the U.S. and leading Israeli officials are in agreement that Israel should not reoccupy Gaza—from which it withdrew in 2005—the latest U.S. comments show the two allies are out of sync on who will exercise political, economic and security authority.

Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said Tuesday that Israel would look at turning over responsibility for governing the territory to an international coalition, including the U.S., the European Union and Muslim majority countries, or to local political leaders in Gaza.

But the U.S. officials’ remarks aimed to set distinct guidelines on what a postwar Gaza should look like, including a unified government for the Palestinian territories, even as Israel widens its military operations.

“This is the clearest statement we’ve heard about how the U.S. envisions postwar Gaza, but it’s not clear that Israeli leadership is on the same page, which will define the next stage of U.S.-Israeli-Arab negotiations,” said Tuqa Nusairat, an analyst of U.S.-Middle East policy at the Atlantic Council think tank.

The U.S. retains strong influence in Israel, but even if the Biden administration’s guidelines are heeded, it won’t be easy to translate those words into a so-called two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or another amicable resolution. Crucially, no authority other than Israel has volunteered to play a security role in Gaza during a transition to local rule by the Palestinian Authority or another Palestinian leadership.

CIA Director William Burns discussed with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and the head of Egyptian intelligence, Abbas Kamel, a proposal for the North African country to manage security in the Gaza Strip until the Palestinian Authority can take over after Hamas’s defeat, according to senior Egyptian officials. Sisi rejected the proposal, saying Egypt won’t play a role in eliminating Hamas because it needs the militant group to help maintain security at the border.

The CIA declined to comment on Burns’s travel.

While President Biden has said the reoccupation of Gaza by Israel would be a “big mistake,” officials have previously hesitated to say publicly what should or shouldn’t happen next in Gaza. Some have hinted at an international force to help keep the peace and administer the territory while officials work on revitalizing the Palestinian Authority, widely seen as weak and undemocratic under the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas.

The increased focus on the future of the war-torn strip of territory comes as the Biden administration has come under fire from some Democrats and American protesters who have demanded more humanitarian considerations for civilians in Gaza. Health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 10,500 people have been killed there, most of them women and children. The figures don’t distinguish between militants and civilians.

Blinken’s remarks also come two days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested in an interview on ABC News that Israel would maintain responsibility for security in Gaza for “an indefinite period,” raising concerns in the region that Israel’s right-wing government could use the aftermath of Hamas’s terrorist attack on Israeli citizens to gain new political or security powers in Gaza or the West Bank.

“Blinken is increasingly struggling to bridge the growing gap between Israel, its neighborhood and the international community,” said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The U.S. can play a role, but there needs to be something directly between the Israelis and the Arabs.”

While some in Israel’s government have discussed expelling Palestinians, occupying Gaza, or even a nuclear attack on the enclave, the country’s top leaders have said they only intend to preserve a security presence to address continued threats from Hamas. A senior Israeli official said late Tuesday that Israel has no intention of reoccupying Gaza nor controlling it for a long time. Kirby said Wednesday that “it’s certainly plausible that for at least some period of time Israel Defense Forces are still going to be in Gaza to manage the immediate aftermath and the security situation.”

Benny Gantz, one of five members of Israel’s war cabinet, told reporters on Wednesday that once Israel’s borders are considered safe, “we will [sit] down and review an alternative mechanism for Gaza.”

Beyond security considerations, U.S. officials and analysts see a big challenge in the current state of the Palestinian Authority and the affiliated Palestine Liberation Organization, the umbrella organization that represents Palestinians at the United Nations and other international meetings and speaks for people displaced from the West Bank and Gaza.

U.S. relations with Abbas, the 87-year-old Palestinian Authority leader, have deteriorated since his government split with Hamas in Gaza, postponed elections, and stood by as the Palestinians’ parliament ceased to function for more than a decade and a half.

With many Palestinians rejecting Abbas’s leadership, one option would be for the PLO to hold a congress to bring in new leadership, said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute in Washington. Major changes in Palestinian governance would need the support of key Arab nations.

For now, the PA has refused to engage in any official discussion about how Gaza would be run once the fighting is over, insisting instead on the urgent need of a cease-fire.

In a meeting Monday in Ramallah, Blinken was rebuffed by Abbas when he asked to discuss the running of postwar Gaza, according to Mahmoud Habbash, a close Abbas adviser who was present in the room. The State Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Habbash’s remarks.

“Today is more important than the day after,” Abbas told Blinken as he reiterated his call for a cease-fire. The Palestinian Authority president blamed the U.S. for the continuation of the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip. “You, the U.S., are the only side that can instruct the Israelis to stop the aggression,” he said.

Yet Habbash indicated the Palestinian government he works for expects to be involved in Gaza going forward.

“The PA is the only side that has responsibility for Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank,” he said in an interview. “We didn’t leave Gaza,” he said, saying the Ramallah-based Authority had continued to run some of its ministries in Gaza. He also envisioned a greater role for the PLO.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
The ‘Global South’ Isn’t All Pro-Hamas,2023-11-08T18:18:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Sadanand Dhume'],"As Israel’s war against Hamas grinds on, some pundits have taken to tut-tutting about the dangers for the U.S. of alienating public opinion in the so-called global south, a catch-all term for countries with low per capita incomes, less politely known as the Third World.

In theory, alienating a bloc of nations that account for most of the world’s population would set back American interests. But while there is a tendency to grandstand against Israel among many developing nations, they are hardly a monolith. A crushing Israeli victory over Hamas won’t benefit only the West but the entire world, including many of the countries that routinely castigate the Jewish state.

Some pundits seem not to grasp this. The journalist Howard French claims that “Biden’s emotional and barely nuanced support for Israel” could be a “costly error.” According to the Intercept’s Murtaza Hussain, “in [the] Global South” the Israel-Palestinian conflict “is seen straightforwardly as [a] ruthless anticolonial war similar to those that many of them fought.” In a lecture last month, American political scientist John Mearsheimer said the U.S. was in “deep trouble” owing to its support for Israel in Gaza.

On the surface, this reasoning seems to make sense. Over the past month, anti-Israel protesters have flooded the streets in Pakistan and Indonesia, among other developing nations. Last month the leaders of Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority canceled a meeting with President Biden over false claims that Israel had bombed a hospital in Gaza. Bolivia has cut diplomatic relations with Israel, and Colombia and Honduras have recalled their ambassadors. In a barely comprehensible diatribe, South Africa’s foreign ministry declared that “Israel does not have the ‘right to defend itself.’ ”

But these nations are hardly representative of the developing world. Contrary to what Mr. Hussain argues, there is no unanimity on the Israel-Palestine conflict there. Take India, the world’s most populous nation and an important strategic and economic partner for America. Far from seeing this conflict as an anticolonialist struggle, much of the Indian media has rightly framed Israel as a beleaguered democracy defending itself against a barbarous terrorist group.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly condemned Hamas’s “terrorist attacks” on Israel and declared that Indians “stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour.” Mr. Modi has spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone, and India abstained from a United Nations General Assembly resolution that called for a “humanitarian truce” in Gaza, reportedly because the resolution failed to mention Hamas.

Nor was India the only developing nation that abstained from that one-sided U.N. resolution. So did Cameroon, Ethiopia, Iraq, the Philippines, Tunisia, Zambia and a clutch of Pacific island states. Many of these countries voted for the infamous Soviet-backed 1975 U.N. resolution that equated Zionism with racism. Clearly these nations no longer view the Israel-Palestinian conflict in black-and-white terms.

In reality, most developing countries—including those that take public positions hostile to Israel—would benefit from the annihilation of Hamas. Many nations in Asia and Africa face a genuine threat from the bloodthirsty jihadism the group exemplifies. An Israeli defeat would inspire jihadists across the world. This has direct security implications for developing countries that aren’t predominantly Muslim and have long battled the scourge of terrorism, including India, Thailand, the Philippines and a broad swathe of African nations. But it’s also a serious risk for Muslim-majority nations struggling with homegrown extremist challenges, such as Algeria, Pakistan, Nigeria and Indonesia.

And while the loss of civilian lives anywhere is regrettable, many critics of U.S. policy on Israel sound more bitter than morally serious. Vicious anti-Israel commentary often emerges from places that have failed where the Jewish state has succeeded—creating a durable democracy and making the transition from poverty to prosperity. Pakistan is effectively bankrupt, under de facto military rule, and wracked by terrorist attacks. South Africa can’t prevent thieves from ripping out railway tracks and stripping copper wiring from hospitals. There’s no good reason for the U.S., or the West more broadly, to take moral lessons from countries that have trouble holding a fair election or keeping the lights on.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, widely popular in Latin America for crushing organized crime in his country, may have put it best: “As a Salvadoran with Palestinian ancestry, I’m sure the best thing that could happen to the Palestinian people is for Hamas to completely disappear.”

New College Is a Haven for Harvard Refugees,2023-11-08T18:16:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Richard Corcoran'],"Sarasota, Fla.

Anti-Semitism has reared its ugly head at Harvard. Since Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre of some 1,400 Israelis, Jewish students there have reportedly been bullied, intimidated, spat on and, in at least one case, physically assaulted. Student-led protests call for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people with chants of “Intifada! Intifada! Intifada!” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free!”

These are some of the observations Bill Ackman, a Harvard alumnus and hedge-fund manager, made in a Nov. 4 letter to Claudine Gay, the university’s president. After meeting for several hours with students and faculty, he suggested how the administration might address this “dire” issue. “History has taught us that when the sparks and initial flames of antisemitism emerge,” Mr. Ackman wrote, “we must promptly put out the flames before a conflagration begins.”

He urged the university to act swiftly, but I wouldn’t hold my breath and neither should its students. Instead, those facing intolerance or physical danger at Harvard should come to New College of Florida, where they can study with free tuition thanks to a newly established scholarship program.

They will find that we prize free speech and condemn violence. Since Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed six new members to our school’s board of trustees in January, we’ve vigorously protected free expression on campus. We have enacted measures to stop ideological gate-keeping and enforce disciplinary actions against violence and threats. The administration believes that the right to speak freely doesn’t encompass the right to incite violence or to threaten others physically.

Our school likewise refuses to ostracize certain groups at the expense of others in the name of “diversity, equity and inclusion”—a misnomer for offices whose purpose typically is the opposite of what their name suggests. Mr. Ackman notes that Harvard’s Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging says in its “DEI Commitment Statement” that it welcomes “people of color, women, persons with disabilities, people who identify as LGBTQIA, and those who are at the intersections of these identities.” In other words, Mr. Ackman writes, Jews and others not on the list need not apply—unless they fit one of the delineated identity buckets. An organization truly dedicated to “diversity” and “belonging” shouldn’t establish such narrow parameters for inclusion.

This regrettably is typical of DEI office charters, which often signal which groups are “worthy” of membership. We don’t tolerate that at New College. In February we dismantled our DEI office to ensure that no group is singled out for punishment or preferential treatment.

Authentic free speech is essential on any campus. That includes understanding that the First Amendment wasn’t intended to include, as Mr. Ackman described it, “knowingly advocating . . . violent insurrection and threatening a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.” New College is committed to the civil exploration of ideas. Violence isn’t part of that and never will be.

Reading Mr. Ackman’s letter, I realized that Harvard’s disrepair isn’t unique. A misunderstanding of free speech has led to the silencing of dissent and the promotion of certain narratives by academic elites across the country.

Things are different at New College, where genuine academic freedom and civil discourse flourish. Students from all backgrounds are welcome to join our community and experience an environment dedicated to upholding these values. Anyone suffering injustices at Harvard should visit our campus to learn about academic life in Florida—now on offer with free tuition.

Mr. Corcoran is president of New College of Florida.

The Black Left’s Allies From Stalin to Hamas,2023-11-07T22:34:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Jason L. Riley'],"A delegation of black American journalists, artists and political organizers visited the Palestinian territories in 2015, several months after Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. Among them were Patrisse Cullors , a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, and Marc Lamont Hill , a left-wing academic and commentator.

According to an account published in Ebony magazine, the trip was arranged by Ahmad Abuznaid , a Palestinian lawyer and political activist based in Florida. Its purpose, he explained, was “to allow for the group members to experience and see first hand the occupation, ethnic cleansing and brutality Israel has levied against Palestinians” and “to build real relationships” with fellow critics of the Jewish state. “In the spirit of Malcolm X, Angela Davis , Stokely Carmichael and many others,” Mr. Abuznaid added, “we thought the connections between the African American leadership of the movement in the US and those on the ground in Palestine needed to be reestablished and fortified.”

Mr. Abuznaid’s trio of pinup activists is revealing. Malcolm X was not only a member of the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist group that thrived on hatred of whites in the same way that Islamist organizations today thrive on Jew-hatred. He also was a vocal supporter of Mao Zedong, chairman of the Chinese Communist Party during the Cold War. Ms. Davis was a Black Panther in the 1960s and a longtime member of the Communist Party USA. Carmichael, another 1960s black militant and unabashed racial separatist, called Zionism a “diabolical movement.”

Authoritarians have long sought to undermine capitalism and democracy by exploiting racial strife in the U.S. In the 1930s, black luminaries such as the poet Langston Hughes and the scholar W.E.B. Du Bois, were lured to the Soviet Union, luxuriously feted by Joseph Stalin and sent back home to sing the glories of life under communism.

Paul Robeson, the accomplished black actor and singer, first traveled to Russia in 1934, shortly after Stalin had engineered a famine that killed millions of Ukrainians. During his visit, Robeson gave an interview to the American Communist Party newspaper, the Daily Worker. “I was not prepared for the happiness I see on every face in Moscow,” Robeson said. “I was aware there was no starvation here, but I was not prepared for the bounding life; the feeling of abundance and freedom that I find here, wherever I turn.” In 1952, the Soviet Union awarded Robeson the Stalin Peace Prize.

Most mainstream civil-rights leaders in the U.S. spurned these overtures. Martin Luther King Jr. was a staunch anticommunist, as were such organizations as the NAACP and the National Urban League. As head of the NAACP’s legal team, Thurgood Marshall rejected the notion that the Soviet system offered a better life for blacks, and he even worked with the FBI to expose communist infiltrators. Communists “are all sweetness and light these days, trying to persuade us to join their front organizations,” Marshall once told an audience. “We must continue to make it clear that there is no place in this organization for communists or those who follow the communist line.”

Stalin is dead and the Cold War is over, but totalitarian regimes still see propaganda opportunities in America’s racial unrest. After Michael Brown’s death in 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin told “60 Minutes” that the U.S. had no right to criticize how he handled dissidents, given “the problem in Ferguson.” State-run media outlets in China ran countless stories on the George Floyd protests, and Chinese newspapers criticized the U.S. government for failing to address racial inequality.

Nor is there any shortage today of black leftists willing to play the role of stooge.

reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones has called Cuba the “most equal” country in the Western Hemisphere. BLM activists have defended Hamas’s attack on Israel, and Marc Lamont Hill has taken issue with the media’s “framing” Hamas “as a terrorist organization rather than a government, rather than a democratically elected government and/or political party.”

Last week, the mullahs even got an assist from the celebrated author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who gave an interview to the left-wing news program “Democracy Now!” Mr. Coates said that he visited the Palestinian territories with some other writers earlier this year and was “given a tour by our Palestinian guide.” He went on to compare the Israelis to white supremacists and the Palestinians to black Americans living under segregation. “I understood the anger. I understood the sense of humiliation that comes when people subject you to just manifold oppression, to genocide.” he added. “I come from the descendants of 250 years of enslavement.” And like a good propagandist he left out any mention of Hamas or the attacks of Oct. 7.

Where’s the Accountability?

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

Campus administrators need to be held accountable for facilitating and permitting on-campus agitators. My college, the University of Pennsylvania, has been at the center of this debate. As a Jewish student, I have seen acts of anti-Semitism from vandalism to online threats, become commonplace from both student and outsider protesters. I applaud Penn’s donors, led by Marc Rowan and Jon Huntsman, who are putting pressure on our administration by revoking funding.

Americans must unite to hold campus administrations accountable. More than 20 members of Congress published a letter condemning the response of administrators on my campus in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks. Actions such as these may be the steps needed to convince my generation to stop endorsing Hamas.

Claiming to disavow anti-Semitism isn’t enough. Our campuses must take action against hate speech, or Jewish students will simply not be safe on campus.

—Stephen Tahbaz, University of Pennsylvania, politics, philosophy and economics

The Downside of Radical Thinking

Because professors have dabbled in radical politics for decades, it is no mystery that anti-Semitism has become widespread in universities. Academics have normalized violent rhetoric, and student groups justify any act of violence as long as the recipient of the violence is labeled an oppressor.

America has long been indifferent to what goes on in the academy. The anti-Semitic incidents we’ve seen since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, however, have shed light on how toxic campus culture has become. Alumni of prestigious universities should halt donations to schools that refuse to condemn terrorism and curb anti-Semitism. Parents should reconsider the schools to which they send their kids, and prospective students should evaluate whether the schools to which they are applying will give them little more than a crash course on political activism. Boards of regents and university administrators should confront the ideological rot within their schools, particularly in the humanities.

The only good to come out of the current agitation is the opportunity to realign our collective moral compass on American campuses.

Uphold Free Speech

As much as I disagree with supporters of Palestine, I want universities to protect students’ right to express themselves. The threshold for what counts as restricting others’ right to speech should be extremely high. Sporadic invocations of abstract violence should not shut down legitimate discourse.

Left-leaning students supporting Hamas are perverting otherwise sound concepts of intersectionality and oppression. The claim that the Israeli government, by discriminating against Palestinians and occupying their land, is the aggressor is a reasonable argument, and I am glad that this is the position the American government is taking; President Biden has been clear that Israel needs to protect Palestinian civilians during its campaign in Gaza.

What isn’t reasonable is pretending that the existence of Hamas—an organization that advocates genocide and terrorism and refuses to grant Palestinians democratic rights—is justified. It’s infuriating to see feminists implying that Israeli women were effectively asking to be raped by militants by being near Gaza and queer advocates supporting a group that regularly executes homosexuals. There will be no peace as long as Hamas exists. May Israel destroy Hamas—and then grant Palestinians the democracy they deserve.

Fixing Cornell

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

Cornell University has made national headlines in recent weeks: “Israel = Fascism” painted on sidewalks, Prof. Russell Rickford referring to Oct. 7 as “exhilarating,” and posts from a student, Patrick Dai, calling for the murder and rape of Jewish students. Cornell’s administration has hidden behind a cloak of freedom of expression, cautiously sending emails that denounce both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. The university must amend its course.

I fear that many young people support not Palestinians but Hamas, a brazen terrorist organization, because students conflate sharing a colorful information graphic on Instagram with genuine knowledge. Emboldened by a false sense of intellectual authority, college students have rationalized terrorism and murder. These students laud Hamas as an anticolonial force that commendably stands against oppression. What our generation cannot fathom is that these terrorists aren’t the freedom fighters they think them to be.

The First Amendment doesn’t protect words intended to cause and likely to cause an imminent breach of the peace. Neither should our nation’s college administrators.

—Ally Fertig, Cornell Law School

The Pollution of Morality

The crisis of rationality fuels a crisis of morality. Condemning Hamas isn’t necessarily anti-Palestinian just as criticizing Israel isn’t necessarily anti-Semitic. But in an era in which social media has a chokehold on our youth’s collective attention span, nuance takes a back seat.

To think one can adequately grasp a geopolitical issue spanning thousands of years in bite-size infographics is laughable, but that doesn’t stop students (and too many of their educators) from springing out of their seats to get a word in. Not only are these clips and slideshows easy to consume and share, but the hypermoralizing undercurrents that engender them provide viewers with a false sense of intellectual accomplishment and moral authority. Never taken a course on the history of Israel-Palestine? Don’t know how to feel about the newest Middle Eastern conflict? Watch our short video and you, too, can become an expert and take a stance against the bad guys. (Also don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe.)

With the departure of nuance comes the pollution of morality, where empathy becomes a mask for self-aggrandizement. When handling charged conflicts, this form of discourse has deadly consequences. As the historian Anton Jäger has succinctly put it, the politics of crisis gives rise to a crisis of politics.

Jewish Students Meet Hostility at Yale,2023-11-07T22:03:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Sahar Tartak', 'Netanel Crispe']","New Haven, Conn.

When we found out about Monday’s anti-Israel event at Yale, “Gaza Under Siege,” we scrambled to produce fliers offering some context. They detailed Hamas’s atrocities, its anti-Jewish charter, its use of Palestinian civilians as human shields. Our classmates awaiting the event weren’t interested. They yelled, “don’t take the paper!” and tore it up or threw it back at us.

Organizers refused us entry because we weren’t registered but waved others through who also weren’t on the list. The lecture hall was filled, and we resorted to sitting outside and pressing our ears against the door to listen.

What we heard was two hours of denial, lies and incitement. Speakers referred to the atrocities of Oct. 7 in the sanitized language of “civilians killed,” not beheaded, raped or kidnapped. They called the terrorist group “militant,” and one observed that “violent resistance movements often emerge in colonized spaces.”

Nobody mentioned the Hamas charter’s call to “fight Jews and kill them,” but somebody asserted that Israel aims to “inflict as much harm, damage, and death as possible.” One panelist remarked, “The one most important part of our conversation here today is that Israel is still occupying Gaza.” Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.

One of the speakers flatly declared: “No matter what the solution is—a two-state solution or a one-state solution—the Israeli state cannot remain the state of the Jewish people.”

This event had broad institutional support from Yale. “Gaza Under Siege” was co-sponsored by the American Studies, Anthropology and Religious Studies departments; the programs in Ethnicity, Race and Migration and Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies; the Center for Middle East Studies; the Black Feminist Collective (co-directed by the head of Pierson College); the Ethnography Hub; the Edward J. and Dorothy Clarke Kempf Memorial Fund; and Yalies4Palestine. The head of Jonathan Edwards College promoted it in a weekly email. The heads of Yale’s colleges had previously been instructed not to advertise a post-Oct. 7 Shabbat dinner invitation. That event was controversial, an administrator told Ms. Tartak.

In the past month, Yale has become a hostile environment for Jewish students. We’ve seen multiple protests with hundreds of students yelling “resistance is justified”; a petition with 1,200 student and staff signatures accusing Israel of genocide and Yale of “criminalizing” Palestinians’ “right to resist”; the words “I [heart] Gaza” and “love 4 Gaza” written in chalk throughout campus, and Instagram posts by the student group Yalies4Palestine declaring “the Israeli Zionist regime responsible for the unfolding violence” and calling on “the Yale community to celebrate the resistance’s success.”

After the speeches ended on Monday, we entered the hall. Our stomachs dropped at the sight of nearly 200 fellow students, some of whom we had regarded as friends, along with professors we had looked up to in esteem. We asked the moderator and two of the speakers if they were willing to denounce Hamas unequivocally. All three turned their backs on us. So has our university.

Why Let Hamas Win the Messaging War?,2023-11-07T17:49:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy speaks in Kissimmee, Fla., Nov. 4. Photo: octavio jones/Reuters

Vivek Ramaswamy argues that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was wrong to order the disbanding of state campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine, known as SJP (“Cancel Culture Won’t Defeat Hamas,” op-ed, Nov. 3). But his argument is built on sand. Mr. Ramaswamy falsely conflates the First Amendment right to free speech with the right of a university to decide which student groups to recognize and grant privileges.

Can anyone seriously argue that the Ku Klux Klan should be allowed status as a recognized student group? SJP has openly praised Hamas’s unspeakable atrocities of Oct. 7. The group also urges all members to join the “resistance” and calls for the destruction of Israel by any means necessary."
Terrorism and Tax Advantages,2023-11-05T21:09:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Leslie Lenkowsky'],"Missouri Rep. Jason Smith denounced universities and student organizations for statements “celebrating, excusing, or downplaying” the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas in Israel. “Releasing such statements, or failing to condemn them,” he said last month, “is unforgivable and runs counter to our values as a nation.”

Mr. Smith’s comments have more weight than most because he is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy. That includes policies governing nonprofit organizations, including colleges and universities as well as groups issuing statements and staging rallies throughout the U.S. Statements celebrating Hamas’s violence, Mr. Smith adds, “call into question the academic or charitable missions they claim to pursue”—in other words, their tax breaks.

The U.S. has traditionally given charities and their supporters great leeway in handling controversial issues. Constitutional guarantees of free speech and assembly protect their activities and require government to demonstrate a strong reason for restricting them. But Congress and the Supreme Court—as well as nearly three dozen states—have agreed that providing aid to terrorist groups like Hamas is a justifiable reason to forbid donors from supporting them.

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

Mr. Smith’s statement suggests the tax exemptions of organizations backing Hamas—or tolerating such activity—may be in for congressional scrutiny. Virginia’s Attorney General Jason Miyares has launched an investigation of AJP Educational Foundation, aka American Muslims for Palestine. Mr. Miyares’s office said in a press release that it is looking into whether the group “used funds raised for impermissible purposes under state law, including benefitting or providing support to terrorist organizations,” as well as whether it was properly registered to solicit contributions in the state.

But apart from the constitutional issues involved, taking action against these groups won’t be easy. One reason is that some of the most prominent groups aren’t tax-exempt and don’t take tax-deductible contributions directly. Students for Justice in Palestine, whose national chapter was established by activists involved with a now-defunct charity investigated for financing terrorism, isn’t on the Internal Revenue Service’s list of tax-exempt groups. As a result, it isn’t required to disclose—to the public or the IRS—who supports it, making it the same kind of “dark money” group that progressives have criticized conservatives for using.

Those who wish to support SJP are directed on its website to make their donations to the Wespac Foundation, a tax-exempt group in White Plains, N.Y., that calls itself a “leading force for progressive social change.” Wespac is a “fiscal sponsor,” meaning it can receive tax-deductible contributions for organizations not on the IRS list. It doesn’t have to report publicly either the sources of its money or how much of it goes to SJP or other groups. In its IRS filing for 2021, Wespac listed revenue and expenses of about $1 million each but provided few details. SJP also can receive contributions from donors who aren’t interested in a tax deduction, including supporters from other countries.

In Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (2010), the Supreme Court upheld a law making it a crime to provide “material support or resources” to organizations on the State Department’s “foreign terrorist organization” list (which includes Hamas and Hezbollah), even if the donations were earmarked for social services or other peaceful uses. “Money is fungible,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court, expressing doubt that the groups on the State Department’s list could be relied on to keep a wall between their lawful and unlawful activities.

The Holder decision applies only to foreign organizations linked to terrorist groups. A law restricting gifts to American groups that engage in advocacy on behalf of terror groups would face tougher First Amendment scrutiny. But there is a difference between exercising free speech and receiving a tax break for doing so.

Courts and legislators have long tried to distinguish between “education,” which has traditionally been considered a charitable activity, and “propaganda”—intentionally transmitting biases and misinformation on behalf of a particular position—which hasn’t. In formulating tax policies, lawmakers have sought to encourage organizations providing education (and their supporters), while avoiding tax advantages for those involved in propaganda.

This is treacherous terrain. Not long ago, the IRS used a procedure for reviewing tax-exemption applications that singled out groups with words or phrases such as “tea party” in their names. It led to a scandal, congressional hearings, and ultimately a court ruling that outlawed the practice. Now, in determining if an organization’s activities are educational, the IRS is supposed to look not at the group’s views, but at its conduct, which should involve a fair and noninflammatory presentation of facts.

Rep. Smith and many others clearly think that groups calling Hamas members “martyrs” and seeking to “free Palestine from the river to the sea” (meaning, as some have now acknowledged, eliminating Jews from Israel) don’t meet this standard. Many of these groups and their supporters are on the IRS’s list of tax-exempt charitable organizations and responsible for living up to the requirements of tax policy. So too are the colleges and universities that have been tolerating their conduct.

“Charities that encourage violence and cheer on extremism are not contributing to society with any of the purposes the IRS allows,” Elizabeth Schmidt, a nonprofit-law expert at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote last spring. She was looking at right-wing extremism, particularly whether the Oath Keepers Foundation—the fundraising arm of the main group involved in the attack on Congress in 2021—deserved the tax exemption it had at the time. Her conclusion seems to apply with even greater force to the organizations now defending Hamas, minimizing terrorism and calling for the destruction of Israel.

Boycotting the Jews Reaches the West Bank of the Delaware,2023-11-05T16:49:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Sierra Dawn Mcclain'],"The “boycott, divestment and sanctions” movement, or BDS, seeks to strangle Israel economically. It has gone after international tech giant

On Oct. 30, the Philly Palestine Coalition posted on Instagram urging its 15,000 followers to boycott Philadelphia restaurants that are “owned by Zionists,” serve Israeli food, raise money for Israel, or are owned by Philadelphia-based Starr Restaurants.

Among the restaurants on the list is South Philadelphia’s Essen Bakery. Owner Tova du Plessis is Jewish but not Israeli. The coalition says it is targeting her because of an Instagram post she wrote on Oct. 9: “I stand by Israel’s right to exist, to be a home for all Jewish people, to defend herself.”

The boycotters also assert that “restaurants and businesses claiming to sell ‘Israeli’ food, fruits, vegetables, and products are part of an ongoing colonial campaign of stealing, appropriating, and profiting off of Palestinian food and culture as a means of erasing Palestinian existence.” One target is Suraya, a Lebanese restaurant in Fishtown, because a local newspaper quoted one of Suraya’s owners saying “we gain inspiration” from other regional cuisines, including Israel’s.

What does the Philly Palestine Coalition have against Starr Restaurants? Jared Epstein said Hamas’s attack was “not just against Israel but against all Jewish people.” The coalition falsely calls Mr. Epstein a Starr “spokesperson,” but he doesn’t even work for the company. He is a partner of the landlord of Pastis, a Starr restaurant in New York.

The Philly Palestine Coalition has spent the past few weeks organizing protests against Israel. Immediately after Hamas’s terrorist attack on Oct. 7, Nada Abuasi, a Drexel graduate student whom several newspapers have identified as one of the coalition’s organizers, tweeted: “Our fighters know what they are doing. They know decolonization is a practice and that our liberation necessitates armed struggle.” In January 2022, she tweeted that “the Zionist entity has absolutely no right to safety or security” and that Israel “must cease to exist.” (Ms. Abuasi didn’t respond to requests for comment.)

What do Philadelphia officials have to say about this anti-Semitic campaign? Very little. Mayor Jim Kenney refused to condemn the boycott, saying in an email that the city’s priority is to “consider and care for every community in our region that may be experiencing pain and uncertainty due to this conflict.” City Councilman Anthony Phillips offered a similar dodge. “In Philly, food is not political or geopolitical,” he said in a text message. “Some like cheesesteaks from Dalessandro’s and others like them from Max’s!”

Council President Darrell Clarke refused to comment, as did members Kenyatta Johnson, Sharon Vaughn and Cindy Bass. Nine others didn’t respond to requests for comment. Only Councilman Mark Squilla went as far as to say he “does not support this boycott of Jewish-owned businesses in Philadelphia.”

Would city officials respond so equivocally to a boycott of black- or Muslim-owned businesses? The question answers itself.

Israel Steps Up Arrests in the West Bank in Wake of Hamas Attacks,2023-11-05T03:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Omar Abdel-Baqui'],"Israel has more than doubled the rate at which it makes arrests across the occupied West Bank since it was attacked by Hamas militants from Gaza a month ago, an escalation that analysts say risks triggering wider unrest.

The Israeli military says the arrests are part of counterterrorism measures meant to stamp out Hamas’s West Bank network, in an effort to eradicate the U.S.-designated terrorist group following the unprecedented Oct. 7 assault from the Palestinian enclave. More than half of those held since the attacks are associated with Hamas, said spokesmen from the Israeli military and Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic security service. Palestinians and rights groups say innocent people, including political figures, are being swept up by a broad detention campaign that is politically motivated and aimed at stifling dissent.

The Israeli military has also begun to use drones routinely during West Bank raids and has called in airstrikes in the operations in the occupied Palestinian territory, where for nearly two decades the Israelis have typically relied on ground forces.

While Hamas’s militant presence is mainly concentrated in the Gaza Strip, it also maintains a more restrained presence in the West Bank, where it occasionally plans and carries out attacks on Israel.

The number of arrests, though rising, is contested.

Israeli forces say they have detained about 1,200 people in the West Bank since the start of the recent hostilities. According to Israeli officials, more than 740 of those arrested are associated with Hamas, which controls Gaza. The Palestinian Prisoners Society, a nongovernmental agency focused on prisoner rights, puts the number of arrests at about 2,000 people. Last year, Israeli forces detained an average of 500 Palestinians a month in the West Bank, according to a United Nations report.

On many occasions in the past month, West Bank raids have turned deadly.

Of the more than 140 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7, about half were killed during armed confrontations with the Israeli military during arrest operations, while roughly one-third were killed during Gaza-solidarity demonstrations, according to the U.N., without elaborating on the circumstances. Most of the remainder were killed while attacking or allegedly attacking Israeli forces or settlers, and in settler attacks against Palestinians, the U.N. said.

In raids on Thursday and Friday, the Israeli military killed 11 Palestinians in several cities, according to the U.N. Israel said it was targeting the activities of Hamas and that it arrested 37 people, including 17 Hamas affiliates.

The arrests—along with increased violence against Palestinians by Israeli forces and settlers—come amid the widespread bombardment of Gaza and are creating a climate in the West Bank that is primed for a violent insurgency that has taken place during past Palestinian uprisings, known as intifadas, Israeli, Palestinian and Western analysts say.

“Israel is trying to use further force to deter anything from happening in the West Bank, but it may escalate things,” said Mairav Zonszein, senior analyst for Israel-Palestine at the International Crisis Group, which has called for a pause in the Israeli bombing to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Hamas militants in Israel last month killed over 1,400 people and took over 240 hostage, according to Israeli officials. Israeli airstrikes in retaliation have killed more than 9,400 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza health authorities, whose figures don’t distinguish between militants and civilians.

Since the war began, videos circulating on social media allegedly showed Palestinian detainees being beaten, stripped naked and blindfolded by Israeli forces, stirring public anger in the West Bank. It wasn’t possible to independently verify the videos. The U.N. Human Rights Office said it had received consistent and credible reports of “widespread cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of detainees, and of physical and psychological violence against family members.”

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said he had seen the footage and that the military was investigating. “It’s against our moral values. It’s against the IDF code,” Hagari said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.

Israel watchers, including academics and analysts at think tanks covering the Middle East, say the arrests in the West Bank are aimed at securing the occupied Palestinian territory for Israeli settlers living there and preventing a militant group from filling any power vacuum. “It could backfire, though,” said Ashok Swain, professor and head of the Department of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University in Sweden. “You can’t continuously sow force and suppress any kind of uprising without expecting a reaction.”

Polls suggest that many Palestinians have a deep distrust for the Palestinian Authority, the semiautonomous government of the West Bank, viewing it as collaborating with Israel, ineffective and repressive. Legislative elections haven’t been held in Gaza and the West Bank since 2006, when Hamas’s victory triggered a power battle with the PA that ended with the militants taking power in the Gaza Strip and the PA governing parts of the West Bank.

The crackdown against West Bank militants is also catching political activists and leaders in its dragnet, lawyers and analysts say, including those who have run for local office as members of the Hamas political party in the West Bank or who have engaged in its charity arm. Israeli officials didn’t respond to requests for comment about whether the arrests are targeted specifically at Hamas’s militant wing.

Mounir Al-Jaghoub, spokesman for Fatah, the ruling political party of the PA, said the Israeli military raids would create a wave of violence and instability that would eliminate an already weak PA and any hope for a two-state solution.

Diana Buttu, a lawyer and former Palestinian peace negotiator, said the detentions have a double purpose for Israel: first, to pressure Hamas to give into Israeli demands; and second, to deter people from joining militant or political groups. Middle East analysts warn, though, that if the current Israeli operations in the West Bank go too far, they could have the opposite effect.

Israeli security officials and the prime minister’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Israel routinely uses its system of administrative detention in the West Bank to hold people without charge or trial, according to Israeli human-rights organization B’Tselem. This allows authorities to detain people on suspicion of planning to break the law. Some Palestinians, including minors, are held for years on end, the group said.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Hamas Has Deadlier Weapons Than the Last Time Israel Invaded Gaza,2023-11-04T03:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Benoit Faucon', 'Sune Engel Rasmussen']","The last time Israel invaded the Gaza Strip nearly a decade ago, its troops pummeled an overmatched Hamas fighting force. They destroyed tunnel systems and sealed off smuggling routes, costing the Islamist group two-thirds of its missiles by the time they withdrew.

Now, as Israel steps up a new invasion, it faces a more-potent enemy that has rebuilt its arsenal with help from Iran. Since the operation started on Oct. 27, Hamas has attacked the Israeli army with explosive-laden drones, anti-tank missiles and high-impact rockets—the sorts of weapons that have transformed the battlefield in Ukraine.

With 26 fatalities in a week of operation, Israelis are dying at more than twice the rate as in 2014, when 67 lost their lives during a seven-week campaign.

At the heart of Hamas’ ability to respond to the invasion is the group’s longstanding relationship with Iran, which has continued to support the Palestinian militants with money and technical expertise. In the months leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, hundreds of Hamas fighters went to Iran for military training, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official, said that while he expects Israel to ultimately triumph, the sophisticated arsenal meant Israel would have to brace for a long-haul struggle. “Hamas is a military power that is significant thanks to Iran,” said Melamed. “They are armed to the teeth.”

The Islamist group has used the expertise to develop local skills in arms manufacturing, cobbling together weapons from materials available in the Gaza Strip, despite an Israeli and Egyptian blockade of the territory, weapons it is now using to fight the Israeli army.

Some analysts say that even if Israel manages to deplete Hamas’ military capabilities, the destruction wrought to achieve that goal may prompt a lengthy insurgency once the campaign is over.

The U.S. fought several wars against militant groups, including al-Qaeda and the Taliban, only to face lengthy and stubborn insurgencies. Eradicating Hamas will perhaps be even harder, analysts say.

“Hamas has very, very deep roots, and that’s different from al Qaeda, which was smaller,” said Dan Byman, senior fellow and expert in counterterrorism with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.

Even if a defeat for Hamas deters Palestinians from joining the group, the Israeli offensive will fuel anger among Palestinians, who might join other armed groups. Israel hasn’t offered any indication of what comes after the military operation. It likely won’t maintain a permanent ground troop presence in the strip, and there are no settler communities that appear willing to live there. Crucially, Byman said, even the U.S. had tangible support in the populations where it fought insurgencies.

“The U.S. had advantages, a lot of Iraqis and Afghans who wanted to work with them,” he said. “There are no Palestinians eager to work with Israelis in Gaza.”

Marwan Abdel-Al, a senior official in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Syria-based secular armed group with operations in Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank, said in an interview in Lebanon that Hamas and its allies are better equipped to respond to an Israeli ground invasion than in the past.

“Today, it’s totally different from 2014,” he said, pointing to drones, as well as the type of advanced guerrilla methods developed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Russian Wagner mercenary group.

The Front said it participated in the Oct. 7 attacks and that it continues to lob missiles into Israel from Gaza.

Abdel-Al warned Israel will get bogged down, like Germany did in Russia during World War II or the U.S. in Vietnam. “The guys there, on the ground,” he said, “they are ready.”

Hamas has been manufacturing rockets for more than two decades. The first generation of Qassam rockets, cheap sugar-fueled rockets that Hamas began producing during the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada, around 2001, had a range of 2 to 3 miles. The third generation, Qassam 3, had a range of about 10. Now, Hamas has shown missiles with a range of up to 150 miles, covering basically all of Israel.

In the past, Iran produced rockets in Sudan and smuggled them into Gaza via tunnels from Sinai with the help of Egyptian Bedouins. That has largely been stopped now, since Egypt flooded the tunnels and Sudan initiated a rapprochement with Israel and distanced itself from Iran. Instead, Hamas and Islamic Jihad have moved to indigenous production and are manufacturing both explosives and the weapon from raw materials, according to analysts.

To manufacture rockets, Hamas has used steel piping for metal in motors and warhead casings. It has used unexploded Israeli artillery heads for explosives. Other elements, like the fusion system and fins are easy to build and weld together, and fuel for the rocket’s propellant can be smuggled in.

Hamas’ most-potent defense may be its extensive tunnel network that runs beneath Gaza like an underground city, storing fighters, fuel, weapons and, since Oct. 7., hostages.

“The tunnels really change everything,” said Daphné Richemond-Barak, professor at Reichman University in Herzliya, Israel, and author of a book on underground warfare. “The tunnels neutralize any military advantage.”

Hamas’ tunnels have been extended and reinforced since the 2014 war, likely with counsel from Iran, which keeps some of its own military facilities underground, Richemond-Barak said, adding that Hamas has also been inspired by Islamic State’s use of similar tunnels.

“This is probably the most sophisticated network of tunnels seen in any type of war,” she said.

The tunnels also run to the sea, which can be used for smuggling, to launch unmanned underwater vehicles and as conduits for Hamas frogmen, according to Lenny Ben-David, an expert in Hamas weaponry with the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a think tank.

The central role of the tunnels partly explains the scale of the Israeli bombardments. Israel says Hamas stores weapons and command centers under civilian buildings, including hospitals. Israel has also deployed a special-forces unit specialized in searching and destroying tunnels, called Yahalom.

To get to Hamas’ weapons, the Israeli military must “peel off the top layer of Gaza,” Ben-David said.

Israel says it has hit more than 11,000 targets in Gaza, population two million, using missiles, bombs and artillery.

The campaign has taken a tremendous toll on Palestinians in the Strip, killing more than 9,200, the majority women and children, according to health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza. The toll doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. An estimated 1.5 million people have been displaced, many of them fleeing south or taking shelter in schools, hospitals and international aid facilities.

Earlier this week, repeated Israeli airstrikes targeted Jabalia, a refugee camp that has become a warren of permanent homes. Gaza hospital officials said hundreds of people were killed and injured in the strike. The Israeli military said it had struck an underground bunker killing dozens of militants, including a senior Hamas commander who played a key role in the Oct. 7 massacre.

Privately, Hamas has expressed confidence it can sustain a long-term campaign before it runs out of arms, according to officials in the region. A few days after the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas told Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian the militants “can continue for months on their own,” Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said in an interview.

Back in 2014, Hamas mostly relied on Soviet-era projectiles with no guidance system that dated as far back as 1969, according to a United Nations report published the following year. Drones were a rarity in Hamas’ hands and were generally crude models with limited strike capabilities.

In this war, Hamas has published videos of targeting Israeli troops with munitions dropped from drones, a Ukraine-style battlefield innovation, and damaged two tanks and several military vehicles.

Israeli forces have also faced attackers equipped with North Korea-made F-7 High-Explosive Fragmentation rockets; Kornet man-portable anti-tank guided missile, a model developed in Russia but often copied by Iran; and locally-produced “Al-Yassin” Tandem anti-tank rockets.

A new addition to the battlefield has been paragliders, which Hamas used to penetrate Israel on Oct. 7 as a form of airborne infantry. To avoid detection in Gaza, Hamas fighters received training in paragliding in Iran, according to people familiar with the matter.

This week, Hamas published a video displaying a guided underwater vehicle called Al-Asef described by Hamas as a “torpedo,” which appears similar to an underwater drone that Israel in 2021 said the militant group had tried to fire at one of its vessels.

Hamas has acquired these weapons despite attempts by Israel and Egypt in the aftermath of the 2014 war to reduce the flow of weapons going through tunnels connected to Gaza with the Sinai. Over time, some of those routes were rebuilt and smuggling resumed, according to Middle-East security officials.

More importantly, Israel failed to seal off access by sea to Gaza’s 25 miles of coastline. Smuggling by sea, especially via fishing boats used by local Gazans, has been much more difficult to monitor for the Israeli military.

The sea route may explain the presence of specialty assault rifles that turned up on the bodies of dead militants on Oct. 7. The AK-103-2 were initially manufactured by a Russian government factory and exclusively bought by Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi following the lifting of an arms embargo in 2003, said Adam Rousselle, a researcher at the Militant Wire, a network of experts that examines weapons used by non-state actors.

A team of Hamas operatives exported large amounts of weapons sent from Libya to Gaza possibly as recently as 2017, according to a Libyan prosecutor’s file reviewed by the Journal. The group received the assistance of the two former leaders of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, an al-Qaeda affiliate, said a Libyan security official.

During its rampage at Kibbutz Holit, a rural settlement 1.2 miles from the Gaza Strip, Hamas used Iranian made man-portable surface-to-air missiles, according to Calibre Obscura, an open source analyst that specializes in identifying weapons used by non-state actors. The armed branch of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad posted a video of an attack on the settlement with anti-tank guided missiles. Both weapons were produced by subsidiaries of the Iranian ministry of defense in the 1990s.

Hamas has also developed a robust domestic weapons-manufacturing capability that partly relies on Iranian technology transfers.

It has built a drone called Ababil, developed after Iranian design. Hamas also has a domestically produced drone called the Zouari, named after a Tunisian engineer, Mohammed al-Zawari, who helped develop the weapons and was assassinated in Tunisia in 2016, a killing Hamas blamed on Israeli intelligence.

“We have to destroy these places and not allow them to be built again,” said Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and now senior fellow at the conservative Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies think tank, referring to Hamas’ military infrastructure. “That’s why the IDF after the war will maintain freedom of action in Gaza, whether with airstrikes or troops on the ground.”

Universities Face Increase in Demands to Protect Jewish Students,2023-11-04T01:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Matt Barnum', 'Sara Randazzo', 'Melissa Korn']","Student-led demonstrations have taken place on college campuses across the U.S. since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last month.

Rising tensions on campuses related to the Israel-Hamas war have led to widespread calls for colleges to do more to protect Jewish students from bigotry and threats of physical harm.

A group of more than 30 Modern Orthodox high schools has joined donors, alumni and law firms in calling on colleges to rein in antisemitism after a rash of protests and antisemitic incidents on campuses that have left many Jewish students deeply unnerved.

The private schools, which are generally small but serve as feeders to elite colleges, say they expect any school recruiting their students to make clear how they will keep Jewish students safe.

“A university campus should be a safe space for free speech, but it must first and foremost be a safe space,” leaders of the schools wrote in a joint letter sent to families Friday.

Rabbi Eliezer Rubin, who heads the Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School in New Jersey, wants to see colleges discipline students for antisemitic rhetoric and remove student groups from campus that have a record of inciting hate. “Administrators should be equally as concerned about Jewish kids as they are about all biases and racism on campuses,” he said.

Soon after the Oct. 7 killing of more than 1,400 people in Israel by Hamas militants, the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that seeks to root out antisemitism, reported a dramatic spike in antisemitic incidents across the country.

Many of those have occurred on college campuses, including online threats to kill Jewish students made by a Cornell student, who was arrested Tuesday and faces federal charges. The Ithaca, N.Y., campus canceled classes Friday.

First Amendment advocates say that while colleges need to protect students from violent threats, they also need to protect free speech on campus.

Greg Lukianoff, the chief executive of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which advocates for free speech on college campuses, said protesters shoving others or tearing down photos of hostages taken by Hamas aren’t protected speech.

But speech that doesn’t incite violence should be protected by universities, even if some find it bigoted. “With few exceptions, elite colleges have done a pretty terrible job of discerning protected from unprotected speech,” he said.

So far, some universities have responded to safety concerns with task forces, action plans and statements: Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, and the University of Pennsylvania all have announced in recent days efforts to combat antisemitism.

But doing so won’t be easy. Some Jewish students say they have lost confidence in their school leaders, many of whom were accused of issuing slow or equivocal statements following Hamas’s attack on Israel.

“I have never been more uncomfortable to be a Jewish student having to walk through Harvard Yard when there are people chanting things like, ‘From the river to the sea,’ ” said Alex Bernat, a junior at Harvard. The Anti-Defamation League describes this pro-Palestinian slogan—which concludes “Palestine will be free”—as antisemitic, saying it calls for eliminating the Jewish state.

A Harvard spokesperson pointed to recent comments made by Harvard President Claudine Gay. “Antisemitism has no place at Harvard,” she said, announcing an advisory group to combat antisemitism.

Pro-Palestinian groups have previously countered that “attempts to conflate criticism of the Israeli government or Zionism with anti-Jewish racism” were baseless. Since Oct. 7, an Israeli military campaign has killed more than 9,000 people, mostly women, children and older people, according to the United Nations.

Palestinian supporters, meanwhile, say schools should be doing more to protect them from doxing and harassment.

At the University of Pennsylvania on Friday, pro-Palestinian demonstrators led chants of “Free, free Palestine!” and “Penn trustees you cannot hide, stop funding this genocide,” outside a board meeting. Gigi Varlotta, an organizer and recent Penn graduate, said the school hasn’t done enough to support Palestinian students and their allies.

“There has been no support from the university at all toward Palestinian students. Right now, everything has been focused on antisemitism,” she said in an interview after the protest. “An acknowledgment of Palestinian students and the pain and suffering they’re going through” would be a start, she said.

In a statement this week announcing a plan to combat antisemitism, Penn President Liz Magill said she knows the Palestinian, Muslim and Arab communities feel unseen and have been targeted as well. “This is unacceptable and must be addressed with equal vigor,” she said.

Two Jewish civil-rights groups have called on universities to investigate local Students for Justice in Palestine chapters. That sentiment prompted an open letter to university administrations from the American Civil Liberties Union in support of pro-Palestinian protesters’ free speech rights.

Nearly 200 Columbia and Barnard faculty signed a letter this week supporting students trying to situate the Oct. 7 attacks into the broader history of the Middle East conflict, arguing they shouldn’t be shamed or targeted for supporting Palestinians.

“One could regard the events of October 7th as just one salvo in an ongoing war between an occupying state and the people it occupies,” the professors wrote. Statements probing the history, they say, “constitute a terrain of completely legitimate political and legal debate.”

Many Israelis Are Refugees From Arab Lands,2023-11-03T22:48:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Edward Meir'],"As people around the world demonstrate for Palestinian rights, we shouldn’t overlook another group of Middle Eastern refugees who also have suffered for decades but whose plight is seldom discussed: the displaced Jewish refugees from Arab lands. I should know; I am one of them. Our story needs to be told.

I was born in Baghdad, Iraq, as were my parents and grandparents. When Cyrus the Great liberated Babylon in 538 B.C. and gave Jews the choice to leave, my ancestors stayed. By 1948 an estimated 135,000 Jews lived in Baghdad, comprising one-third of the city’s population—more Jews by proportion than Warsaw or New York at the time. Iraqi Jews were active in government, launched businesses and held prominent positions. Iraq’s first finance minister, Sassoon Eskell , was Jewish. He insisted that the British pay for Iraq’s oil in gold rather than pounds sterling, a prescient move that salvaged the country’s finances after sterling crumbled.

By the time modern Israel was founded in 1948, some 900,000 Jews lived in the Arab world. Over the next few decades, their ranks shriveled. Jews were stripped of their passports, assets and businesses. Many were expelled in mass airlifts and were prohibited from returning. Some Arab countries banned emigration to Israel, prompting Jews to arrange to be smuggled out. Many died in the countries they called home. Others were imprisoned or executed, including relatives of mine who were hanged in Baghdad’s public squares in the late 1960s on trumped-up charges of being Zionist spies. Saddam Hussein was among the henchmen presiding over these sham trials.

By 2012 only about 4,300 Jews lived in the Arab Middle East, concentrated mainly in Morocco and Tunisia. The Jews in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Libya virtually all vanished. Algeria had 140,000 Jews in 1948 and none by 2012. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi told Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month that Egyptian Jews were never subject to repression, but he failed to explain why the country is now largely devoid of them.

And so I ask, what about the rights of Jews in Arab lands? Who will return our property and funds and stolen lives? Where was our “right of return”? Why weren’t there protests on our behalf?

Middle Eastern Jews were able to move to Israel after they were displaced. But because living conditions were difficult early on and few jobs awaited those streaming in, many moved elsewhere, including to the U.S., Canada and the U.K. My father moved to Iran in the early 1950s, where the Jewish community enjoyed a relatively peaceful period under the shah. I attended an American-run K-12 school in Tehran—complete with SATs and cheerleaders—before coming to the U.S. for college. But going back to Iran wasn’t an option once the mullahs took over in 1979. In effect, I was displaced twice. Now living in the U.S., I enjoy rights I never dreamed of growing up in the Middle East.

Contrast this to the 22 Arab countries that have never been welcoming toward Palestinian refugees or integrated them. Apart from Jordan, which until recently took in more than its fair share, most other Arab countries have had an uneasy relationship with their Palestinian neighbors. The approximately 200,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon aren’t eligible for citizenship and have limited access to healthcare and education. Syria has refused to grant its Palestinian refugees citizenship. Egypt didn’t want Palestinian Gaza back, leaving it for Israel to govern until Israel evacuated the territory in 2005.

About half the displaced Palestinians live in Israel, and although subject to hardships that shouldn’t be ignored, they enjoy a higher standard of living than Palestinian refugees living elsewhere. Meanwhile, the number of Palestinian refugees living across the Middle East has ballooned to six million, the largest stateless community in the world. Palestinians, unlike other refugees, are protected by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency instead of by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Unrwa doesn’t have a mandate to resettle refugees, so it is in effect a refugee enabler, preventing Palestinians from rebuilding their lives by going to other countries as Middle Eastern Jews did.

Equally tragic for the Palestinians are the poor choices their leaders have made on their behalf. Periodic offers of a two-state solution have been dismissed since 1948. In July 2000, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered Palestinian President Yasser Arafat far-reaching concessions for a self-governing entity and eventually a state. Mr. Arafat rejected the deal. In 2008, after another round of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered a sweeping proposal, which Mr. Arafat’s successor, Mahmoud Abbas, turned down. The mood in Israel has also hardened. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has essentially given up on negotiations, opting instead to make peace with other Arab countries.

Amid more conflict and violence, I hope that Israelis and Palestinians find the peace they seek and deserve. From one ex-Jewish refugee to a current Palestinian one, I welcome you to a home and a state, but only if you come in peace and with leaders who are like-minded in this noble pursuit. I hope the wait won’t be long—but sadly, I think it will be.

Israel Needs a New Leader,2023-11-02T22:04:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Peggy Noonan'],"I continue to think about the fault lines exposed by what has happened in Gaza, including the generational division on support for Israel.

Political splits between old and young aren’t new. May 1968 in France was a split between college students and their elders and it was fierce and culture-changing. When I was in college Vietnam split America between the rising young and the generation that fought World War II.

Splits aren’t new, but the one happening now is troubling in unique ways. For one, the anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian university students this time are reflecting a generation of indoctrination in higher ed: They’ve been taught to hold progressive views and do, taught to approach history as a matter of oppressor/oppressed, with the West the oppressor, and do.

American students in the 1970s hadn’t been instructed all their lives in the proper view on Vietnam. For all the intellectual fads and fashions that swept through their era, their commitments rose up pretty much from the students themselves: The anticommunist obsession of the U.S. government was wrong-headed, the domino theory mindless, the bombing of innocent agrarian villagers wicked. Young men didn’t want to be drafted, so they took to the streets.

If you’re in your 20s now, you’ve been taught throughout high school and college to view the world within a certain framework: white privilege, Western imperialism, the whole woke agenda. Every time you try to describe that regime you feel like you’re reciting clichés, which is part of its brilliance as an ideology: It makes you feel as if you’re chasing ghosts when you know you’re not.

While students were being indoctrinated, they weren’t being educated. Critical thinking can only get you in trouble, so stick with the narrative, don’t read too deep. A professor at an esteemed college mentioned this week that when he likened the airport mob in Dagestan to a “pogrom,” not one of his students knew what the word meant.

But what’s newest in these protests is the bloody-mindedness. The letters produced by students and the prevaricating responses of university leaders came immediately following 10/7, when it was already clear that unarmed Israeli civilians had been targeted, children and old people executed or taken hostage in the kibbutzim. One might call them innocent agrarian villagers. The college groups were aligning themselves with the strategically deliberate use of violence on civilians. And the final shock—that “We support the Palestinian people” devolved so quickly into hatred for Jews. This anti-Semitism was new. That’s not America, that’s not how we roll. It is beyond disquieting and feels like an active threat to the American future.

What are the universities going to do about this? It is good that alumni and donors are pushing back, good that some professors are speaking out. But I must say the general mood of many people my age is an astounded sense that we began in our youth, in the 1960s and ’70s, saying “Don’t trust anyone over 30.” And now, as we survey the wreckage the woke regime has done to the academy, the arts, the corporate office, we are thinking something that had never crossed our minds. “Don’t trust anyone under 30.”

We continue to think in this space that the invasion and bombardment of Gaza was a mistake, and not only because of the intractable question of who will govern it when the Israelis are done.

After the morning of 10/7 Israel was a wounded and grieving nation. It had endured a profound and gruesome shock; everyone in the country knew someone among the dead or abducted. In the world, those with a fully developed moral interior suddenly saw Israel differently. In their shock, opponents felt an easing of their coldness, supporters a quickening of their warmth.

In our view what was needed for Israel was an absorbing, a regirding. Sometimes you must wait, build up your strength, broaden your resources, reach out to friends, let opportunities present themselves—everything shifts in life; some shifts are promising. But don’t get sucked into Gaza and spend months providing the world with painful and horrifying pictures of innocent Palestinian babies being carried from the rubble. (“We told them to leave,” isn’t enough. Some people can’t leave, they’re not capable, they’re old people in an apartment somewhere.)

A few weeks of that and the world goes back to its corners.

Every day as things turn more kinetic, more fiery, with more casualties, there is the increased possibility it all spills over into the region, and new fronts are opened, and, as Israel goes deeper, the hostages are killed.

All this is a gift to cable news. Here is a truth: Anything good for cable news is bad for humanity.

Our final point. If the Gaza operation continues, it is even more important for Israel to face the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu is the wrong leader for this crucial moment. His own country doesn’t trust his leadership. He sapped the Israeli people’s strength over the past year by forcing on them a deeply damaging dispute over his judicial power grab, sundering what unity they had. His actions smeared Israel in the eyes of the world as increasingly undemocratic. He has been aggressively deaf on the rights of the Palestinian people.

Whatever war decisions he makes will be interpreted as not moving out of protectiveness and high strategy but from a desire to salvage his own reputation. He has allowed the messianic settlers of the West Bank to expand and dominate, and they may deliver to Israel a new war front. From the Financial Times on Thursday: “Armed settlers have stepped up their assaults on Palestinians, especially those in remote villages.” The European Union this week called it “settler terrorism” and asked Israel to stop it. Some think only Mr. Netanyahu has the clout to make them stop. But they haven’t stopped. Maybe they too see his weakened position.

The corruption charges that have dogged him leave him, always, with a reputation for untrustworthiness. As for his judgment, after Oct. 7 he essentially hid out from his own people and, having decided to come out and speak more, he decided to send out a Trumpesque tweet accusing Israeli’s security and military institutions, not him, of being responsible for Oct. 7. In the outcry that followed he did something uncharacteristic, which is admit the mistake and delete the tweet. You have to wonder what those he insulted have on him.

Sometimes a leader has too much history.

Everything is being remade now; all the pieces are moving on the board. Israel’s meaning must be made new, as if the young are looking at it and trying to understand it for the first time. It would be good for them to have a new person the world could look at, freshly weigh his or her words, sift them. Even if this person isn’t “much better,” an unknown variable might shake this up in a way that benefits civilization.

The U.S. in its support of Israel is tied to this discredited man in a way that doesn’t help.

It is a mistake for Israel, for its Knesset, to allow him to continue.

Biden Needs a New Foreign-Policy Team,2023-11-02T20:42:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Garry Kasparov'],"Oct. 7 wasn’t only the greatest intelligence failure in modern Israeli history; it was also a massive failure of American intelligence. As in Afghanistan and Ukraine, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns and national security adviser Jake Sullivan were shown to be clueless.

Yet not everyone was caught flat-footed by the Hamas assault. The anti-Zionist movement mobilized right away, and not only in the Arab world. As the first images of terrorism emerged, America’s activists began organizing on behalf of the attackers. Soon they were in the streets and on campuses across the country. They chanted the genocidal mantra “from the river to the sea.” Many leftist organizations, college student groups and professors, and even some elected officials, hailed the terror attack as resistance, exposing their moral bankruptcy and horrifying the liberal American Jews who had considered them allies.

It was a painful realization, but one that was past due. The left’s anti-Semitism doesn’t get the headlines of neo-Nazis with torches, but is more dangerous because it take subtler forms.

Those who won’t go as far as endorsing Hamas’s terror attacks will tell you Hamas doesn’t represent Gaza. Then why are they protesting Israel, and not Hamas, which started this war? Why hasn’t the Palestinian Authority condemned the genocidal crimes of Hamas, its sworn enemy?

At a rally in Istanbul on Oct. 28, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Hamas “freedom fighters” and Israel a “war criminal.” Like many other autocrats, Mr. Erdogan sees conflict as a way to distract his people from economic hardship and his domestic failures. That’s especially easy when Israel is involved, which is why the last thing the region’s Muslim leaders want is a peaceful resolution to the Palestinian problem.

Moscow hosts Hamas delegations and boasts that Russians taken hostage in Gaza are getting favorable treatment. China’s Baidu web service erased Israel’s name from its online maps, an ominous echo of Islamist threats to wipe Israel from the map.

This synchronized surge of anti-Israel sentiment and Hamas’s ability to wage such a war are symptoms of a failure in American global leadership.

Over the past three years, the Biden administration has blundered from one geopolitical disaster to another. Messrs. Burns and Sullivan lost Afghanistan, bungled the withdrawal, and then abandoned Ukraine to Russia—saved only by Volodymyr Zelensky’s heroic stand in Kyiv.

Now, they have been outplayed by Iran as well. In September, the U.S. agreed to pay Iran more than $6 billion to release five American hostages. Smirking all the way to the bank, the ayatollah’s ministers finalized their plans for the biggest victory of all, one they never cease discussing: the destruction of the state of Israel.

Amid this new humiliation, Mr. Sullivan declared peace for our time in Foreign Affairs magazine. After Iran and its Hamas proxies refuted Mr. Sullivan’s ignorance with the blood of 1,400 Israelis, he edited his essay for the online edition, which had a later deadline.

The reason Messrs. Burns and Sullivan have been wrong so often is because they still fail to realize that we are at war—a single war against dictatorships and terrorists. Just as Russia’s armies began to lose ground in Ukraine, Hamas attacked Israel, and Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro prepared a referendum asserting territorial claims over a large part of neighboring Guyana.

I believe in coincidences, but I also believe in the KGB. Until we defeat Vladimir Putin, he will continue to open up more fronts in his war against America and the global world order it leads, siphoning attention and resources from Ukraine.

Already, Mr. Putin’s allies in the Republican Party, such as Reps. Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, have declared their intent to undermine support for Ukraine, which would have disastrous consequences for Israel and other U.S. allies.

The Biden administration’s waiting game has had grave consequences. Had the U.S. provided Ukraine with ATACMS, F-16s, and tanks from day one, it could have destroyed Russia’s armies in the field and won the war before Russian forces became entrenched.

But Messrs. Burns and Sullivan feared the potential chaos of Russian defeat more than they feared Ukraine’s destruction. Now, two years and half a million casualties later, Russia has dug in deep, and every Ukrainian advance will come at a high price.

Decisive early intervention would also have warned every other dictator that the U.S. wasn’t a paper tiger. America’s hapless deal makers are getting what they most feared anyway: emboldened dictatorships and spreading chaos.

Mr. Putin still wages war and his cronies attack the global order from Niger to the Nile and from Belarus to Venezuela. Iran’s foreign minister comes to New York City and threatens the lives of American citizens. China prepares to invade Taiwan, waiting for the right moment to strike.

Enough is enough. President Biden must fire Messrs. Burns and Sullivan and select a new foreign-policy team that understands the concept of deterrence. Then leaders like Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin—who acknowledges that we are at war—can finally give our allies the support they need.

It’s war, stupid. And like Israel, Ukraine deserves to win, not merely survive.

For Mr. Putin, Xi Jinping, Mr. Maduro and the ayatollah, this war isn’t optional. The only way these men can cling to power is by blaming their failures on the free world. There can be no de-escalation that doesn’t include defeating them, because for them, the conflict itself is the point.

Whether fighting anti-Semitism at home or standing up to terror and invasion abroad, America’s leaders and the American people must realize their way of life is under attack. You can lose a war you refuse to acknowledge exists. In fact, you are sure to.

"On Anti-Semitism, Labour Is a Cautionary Tale for Democrats",2023-11-02T20:41:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Joseph C. Sternberg'],"Keir Starmer is trying to do the right thing on Israel, he really is. Whether the leader of Britain’s center-left Labour Party will succeed is another matter, and a question of significance for U.S. Democrats.

In the weeks since Hamas’s Oct. 7 invasion of Israel, Mr. Starmer has emerged as a supporter of the Jewish state’s right to self-defense, by European standards anyway. This includes an Oct. 11 radio interview during which he said Israel “does have that right” to blockade Gaza. In a speech Tuesday, despite hemming and hawing about the dangers to Gazan civilians, he added that he wouldn’t support a cease-fire, as it would leave Hamas free to carry out future attacks.

The Labour leader appears to be motivated by both political necessity and sincerity. This is the moment when Mr. Starmer can and must demonstrate to U.K. voters that he has shed the legacy of his predecessor as party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and is ready to govern.

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

Mr. Corbyn’s stint at Labour’s helm from 2015-20 was marred by anti-Semitism. On foreign policy, this included sympathy for Hamas and Hezbollah, which Mr. Corbyn famously described as “our friends.” Before becoming party leader, he had praised a mural featuring anti-Semitic tropes about Jews controlling the global economy and had written a positive foreword for the 2011 edition of “Imperialism: A Study,” a 1902 book that made similar arguments about banking and finance.

Voters rebuffed the party in the 2019 election, and the sharp electoral discipline finally forced Mr. Corbyn out of its leadership.

Mr. Starmer has since made great strides fixing Labour. He apologized to Britain’s Jewish community for the sins of his predecessor and has purged Corbynistas. This includes Mr. Corbyn, who was expelled from Labour’s parliamentary caucus in 2020 and is likely to be barred from running as a Labour candidate in the next election.

Yet now there’s reason to wonder whether the party will stay fixed. Mr. Starmer’s support for Israel has triggered something verging on a civil war within the party. Hundreds of local-government Labour officials, and about a dozen members of Mr. Starmer’s national leadership team in Parliament, have demanded he tone down his support for Israel and call for a cease-fire. If anything is going to cost Labour the next election, this could be it.

The source of most of the unease is Britain’s large Muslim voting bloc, whose members may or may not be overtly anti-Semitic but definitely are “pro-Palestine.” If these voters stay home, Labour will struggle to win. This is the clearest evidence that Mr. Starmer genuinely believes what he says. From climate to taxation, he has ditched left-wing policy priorities with zero compunction to avoid scaring voters. Support for Israel turns out to be the risk he’s willing to take.

Good for him, and good for Labour, too. Though the election risk of losing the Muslim vote gets most of the media attention, Mr. Starmer could just as easily lose an election if he turns on Israel to retain that constituency. Centrist voters abandoned Labour in 2019 out of concern that Mr. Corbyn didn’t represent British values. If Mr. Starmer softens his approach on Israel, he’ll have to explain which values have led him to do so. There’s political danger in either direction, and at least Mr. Starmer is choosing the morally defensible “risk” of supporting Israel.

Alas, the relative good news from the Labour Party hints at bad news for their counterparts across the Atlantic. American Democrats, too, are in the midst of a civil war over their party’s policy toward Israel and anti-Semitism in their ranks. Joe Biden, however, lacks something that Mr. Starmer may employ: mechanisms for party discipline, especially top-down candidate selection. And even such intraparty tools haven’t solved Mr. Starmer’s own dilemmas.

Rather, Labour and the Democrats share a more troubling challenge: If you don’t repudiate the crazy, you end up following it. Party discipline is useful but it can’t fix an ideological problem. The current crisis is much more about the long-term willingness of even moderate center-left leaders to tolerate outrageous opinions on their parties’ leftward fringes.

In the U.K., this manifested as Labour’s refusal over many years to grapple seriously with how to assimilate immigrants, primarily Muslim immigrants, into British culture before coming to rely on them as Labour voters. In America, it’s Democrats’ long tolerance for insanity on the academic left. In both cases, the fringe elements long regarded as cranks by centrist leaders turn out to have bolder aspirations.

The premise of Mr. Starmer’s Labour overhaul was that Britain’s center-left needed new management. Instead it and the Democrats need an ideologically reformed base. If anyone has any good ideas for how to bring about that transformation, Messrs. Biden and Starmer are all ears.

U.S. Seeks Help From Arab States to Plan Gaza Governance After War,2023-11-02T13:30:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['William Mauldin'],"Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his deputies are speaking with their counterparts in Arab states about plans for governing Gaza after Israel finishes its main military operations there, according to people familiar with the early stage conversations.

Officials involved in the brainstorming sessions say it is too early to discuss specifics, and outside analysts don’t see a precise blueprint for administering Gaza as feasible at the moment, but the issue is expected to come up during Blinken’s coming visit to the region.

Blinken will be visiting Israel on Friday for meetings with members of the Israeli government and is expected to make a stop in Jordan. The assistant U.S. secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, Barbara Leaf, has been in the region ahead of Blinken’s visit, discussing future plans for Gaza, among other issues.

Before departing on Thursday, Blinken said, “We need to be focusing on the day after, and so in conversations that we’ll be having over the course of this weekend, I expect you’ll see a focus there and particularly how we can get, over time, to two states for two peoples.”

Officials aware of the early discussions on what is next for Gaza stress that there isn’t yet a plan backed by Washington. One option is a period where Gaza is led by a multinational force from the region.

“The major stakeholders are engaged in these discussions,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “You have to have a credible administrator that can come into Gaza to provide the opportunities for Palestinians.”

Some form of backing from Arab nations is important, officials and analysts say, but coming up with a governance plan in the middle of a ground operation is “like asking about cleaning up after a Category 5 hurricane right as it’s happening,” said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute in Washington.

The attempt at postwar planning comes as the high civilian death toll from Israel’s air and ground operations in Gaza has deepened the rift between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors. Arab governments are reluctant to get involved in Gaza if the Israel Defense Forces are still conducting sporadic or continuous operations against Hamas.

The aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel that killed some 1,400 Israelis—mostly civilians—in October has delayed, if not halted, a multiyear effort to bridge divides between Israel and Arab states. On Wednesday, Jordan recalled its ambassador from Israel in protest of the war in Gaza.

Some Israelis have backed occupying Gaza in the longer term—an option President Biden has rejected—or pushing Gazans to the Sinai region of neighboring Egypt, an idea Egyptian leaders oppose.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the goal is to destroy Hamas’s military capabilities and its ability to govern, but added that his country has no interest in permanently reoccupying Gaza.

Yet as Israel’s ground forces move deeper into Gaza, Israeli and U.S. leaders are faced with the question of who will govern the densely populated enclave once Hamas is removed. What that governing authority might look like is unclear.

“At some point, what would make the most sense would be for an effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority to have governance and ultimately security responsibility for Gaza,” Blinken said.

Under current leader Mahmoud Abbas, 87, the Palestinian Authority, which governs the parts of the West Bank not controlled by Israeli forces or settlers, is seen as too weak to administer Gaza in the near term, officials say.

Some analysts say a coalition of Arab-nation or Palestinian officials or Palestinian leaders could oversee Gaza on a temporary basis until the territory is in a better place to elect its own leadership. Involving Arab nations comes with its own hurdles.

“I think the U.S. would need to accept that Qatar, Turkey, Egypt and Jordan have to play a key role,” said Tuqa Nusairat, strategy director at the Atlantic Council’s Middle East program.

Another possibility would be to persuade Arab states who have signed peace deals or normalization pacts with Israel to provide or oversee a security force for Gaza. But that would require some country or organization to take administrative responsibility and oversee security—essentially an international peacekeeping force.

In general, Arab neighbors are reluctant to take a governing role, fearing it could undermine their long-term goal of an independent Palestinian state. Cairo has also long resisted calls to govern Gaza over concerns it is an excuse to push the territory’s two million inhabitants into Egypt. And Jordan would likely have little interest in participating in a plan that appears at odds with a “two-state solution” to the Israel-Palestinian problem.

“We don’t have answers to what is next in Gaza because none of us know what Gaza is going to look like,” Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s foreign minister, said last week at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

Osama Hamdan, a Hamas leader, told reporters that the militant group condemns U.S. comments about the future of Gaza without Hamas, accusing Washington of interference and attempting to develop a Palestinian leadership to its own standards.

Blinken brought up the future of Gaza on Monday in a conversation with Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, according to a person familiar with the call.

Qatar is a natural choice to play a role in Gaza’s future, given its role as a diplomatic intermediary and in brokering talks with Hamas on issues like hostage release. The oil-rich nation has for years hosted a Hamas political office.

“The Israelis have tried to think of other people than Qatar after Hamas,” said Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute for Near East Peace.

Yet it isn’t clear that Israeli troops will immediately leave or entirely cease operations, after Hamas is removed from power. Remnants of Hamas, or Palestine Islamic Jihad, another militant group, will likely remain, or others could come in. So whoever steps in to help in Gaza in the immediate future will likely have to coordinate on security with Israel, analysts say, which might be a nonstarter.

The idea of Arab nations providing security forces to stabilize Gaza at the same time Israel is looking to destroy remnants of Hamas is “fantasyland,” said Katulis, who expects the U.S. to back security and political leadership from among more moderate Palestinian groups, potentially the Palestinian Authority. “The early thinking is that it’s some form of an indigenous force,” he said, referring to elements of the Palestinian leadership in Gaza from before Hamas came to power in 2007.

One organization that might struggle to take the lead in Gaza governance is the United Nations, although its agencies are heavily involved in humanitarian efforts.

The U.N. Security Council has been deadlocked over the Gaza issue, one of many divides between the U.S. and Russia, which each have veto power, and Israeli officials have criticized Secretary-General António Guterres and threatened to withhold visas from U.N. workers.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Cancel Culture Won’t Defeat Hamas,2023-11-02T17:09:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Vivek Ramaswamy'],"Gov. Ron DeSantis last week instructed the chancellor of Florida’s state university system to disband campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine after the group celebrated the Oct. 7 attack and called for protests against Israel. In banning the group, Florida officials accused it of “knowingly provid[ing] material support” to a foreign terrorist organization—a crime under Florida law. Nikki Haley vowed to “pull schools’ tax exemption status” if they don’t “combat antisemitism in all of its forms,” including “denying Israel’s right to exist.”

These are textbook constitutional violations. SJP expressed heinous opinions—and the First Amendment protects them all.

Florida accuses the group of providing “material support” for Hamas, but the statute defines the kind of support it prohibits: “monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safe houses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel, or transportation.” SJP members weren’t forging passports or shipping weapons. They were tweeting and engaging in other protected speech.

The Supreme Court has said under a similar federal law that advocacy doesn’t count as unlawful material support. In Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (2010), the plaintiffs wanted to provide money and training to terrorist groups from Turkey and Sri Lanka and asked the justices to strike down a federal law nearly identical to Florida’s on First Amendment grounds. They declined because the law penalized conduct, not speech: “The statute does not prohibit being a member of one of the designated groups or vigorously promoting and supporting the political goals of the group. What [it] prohibits is the act of giving material support.”

SJP’s views are repugnant, but the First Amendment is necessary to protect speech we hate. That’s why hate groups, pornographers and teenage protesters feature so prominently in First Amendment litigation. As Thomas Jefferson explained: “We have nothing to fear from the demoralizing reasonings of some, if others are left free to demonstrate their errors.”

Mr. DeSantis has defended the ban, saying the group admitted “that they don’t just stand in solidarity, that they are part of this Hamas movement.” That isn’t true: SJP’s statement says that it is part of “the diaspora-based student movement for Palestine liberation,” not part of Hamas. By associating with a movement halfway around the world, a student group doesn’t transform itself into an arm of a terrorist organization—particularly when there is no evidence that any of its members have ever spoken with Hamas, much less provided money or supplies.

In recent years, colleges have become anticonservative cancel-culture munitions factories. They’ve disciplined students for displaying photos of President Trump, punished professors for refusing to use nonstandard pronouns, and disinvited disfavored speakers or tolerated mobs that shouted them down. Fair-weather fans of the First Amendment like Mr. DeSantis and Ms. Haley undermine the conservative crusade against cancel culture. We can’t condition our pleas on whether we agree with the views expressed.

Mr. Ramaswamy is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.

Democrats Have an Anti-Semitism Problem,2023-11-01T22:21:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Daniel Henninger'],"After the House last week overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning Hamas for its attack in southern Israel Oct. 7, New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottheimer wrote on social media that the 15 Democrats who didn’t vote for the measure were “despicable and do not speak for the party.”

Mr. Gottheimer was only half right. Those 15 members from progressive constituencies may in fact represent the Democratic future. The party of Franklin D. Roosevelt has an anti-Semitism problem.

This week progressive activist groups released a “Gaza 2024 statement” asserting they won’t vote for Joe Biden “if he does not end U.S. support for Israel’s brutal war in Gaza.” The announcement offers background on “Israeli ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza.”

An open letter this week from 100 Columbia professors called the Hamas massacre “a military response by a people who had endured crushing and unrelenting state violence from an occupying power.”

Because the Democrats now consider Muslim Americans an important part of the party’s voting coalition, meetings were held this week at the White House with Muslim leaders. Mr. Biden in his national address last month spoke at length against “Islamophobia.” Anti-Israel protesters paraded in front of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s house in San Francisco last Saturday evening.

Let’s revisit the subject of false equivalence. The Hamas massacre of some 1,400 Israelis on Oct. 7 is described in media reports as the worst attack on Jews “since the Holocaust.” The Holocaust, a central event of World War II, is the greatest calamity in the history of the Jews. But that phrase, “since the Holocaust,” manifestly has no meaning or resonance for many recently educated Americans. It is an abstraction.

Readers of this column do not need this summary, but what is going on now among the American left requires it. The Jewish Holocaust ran from 1933 to 1945. Germany’s Nazi party under Adolf Hitler called it “The Final Solution to the Jewish Question.” The Nazis collected and sent Jews to 23 main concentration camps in Europe. Extermination camps included Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec and Chelmno. Some six million Jews were murdered, often in gas chambers, burned and dumped into mass pits.

One reason the U.S.’s Greatest Generation is called the greatest is that it includes thousands of American GIs who helped liberate the concentration camps. Despite the war, the experience of seeing the camps and the scale and evidence of a systemized killing of Jews was an unspeakable horror. As their relatives know, many of these soldiers would never talk about what they saw.

There was a time when most American schoolchildren had a functioning knowledge of the Holocaust and the camps. No longer. Universities’ hiring and enabling of activist left-wing professors—proponents of the anti-Israel movement called Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions—has affected a generation of students. A Quinnipiac poll found 51% of Democrats younger than 35 don’t support sending military aid to Israel after Hamas’s attack.

Political parties don’t care much what adherents think so long as the votes go into their column. Maybe Democrats never expected Jew-hatred to be a feature of their coalition. Now it is. It is possible today to divide the Democratic Party between those who know what the Holocaust was and those who have no clue, or don’t care. For the record, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gave a strong floor statement Oct. 17, recalling his own family’s Holocaust experience.

On balance, the Biden administration’s support for Israel has been firm because its representatives understand the direct line between the 1930s and Oct. 7. Testifying to the Senate Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken related in frankly unbearable detail Hamas’s dismemberment of an Israeli father, mother, daughter and son in their kitchen.

The insistence by party activists on an Israel-Gaza equivalence is false. Oct. 7 was the return after 80 years of Jewish extermination, an explicit goal of both Hamas and Iran, whose leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sits placidly pondering the completion of the final solution. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified Tuesday that Islamic State “urged its followers to target Jewish communities in the United States and Europe.”

Democratic progressives had already pushed the party onto the bubble with many voters over litmus-test issues like gender identity, systemic racism and defunding the police. Despite that, most Democrats would still vote the party line. But maybe not now.

The Hamas person-by-person slaughter is an event on a scale beyond any standard political issue. The question is whether the embrace by so much of the party’s emerging rank and file of anti-Semitism—a euphemism for active Jew hatred—will finally push Democrats over the line with voters, not least the historically reliable Jewish vote.

Best case, President Biden would explicitly and publicly drive a stake through the heart of the anti-Jewish sentiment taking over his party. Cynics will reply that the anyone-but-Trump factor will overcome even this, but don’t count on it. Rationally, many large Jewish donors already are pulling the plug on giving to anti-Semitic fermentation tanks such as Harvard, Columbia and Penn. The party of FDR could be next.

What the U.N. Secretary-General Left Out,2023-11-01T16:37:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a Security Council meeting in New York, Oct. 24. Photo: eduardo munoz/Shutterstock

Regarding your editorial “The Disgrace of the United Nations” (Oct. 26): U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres is correct when he says that “the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.” But he hurts the cause of peace when he elides the real cause of the crisis.

The Palestinian people would not “have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation” had they accepted, as the Jewish people did, the U.N.’s offer of statehood in 1947; or if they had worked toward establishing a state on the disputed territories which were then occupied by Jordan and Egypt for 19 subsequent years; or had they and their Arab allies not refused to negotiate with Israel—their famous “three Nos”—following the 1967 Six Day War; or had they accepted any of the offers of Palestinian statehood made by Israeli governments over recent decades."
Three Foreign-Policy Illusions,2023-11-01T16:32:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Jakub Grygiel'],"Simultaneous crises are threatening global stability and taxing U.S. power and attention. Russia’s war in Ukraine, Hamas and Iran’s aggression against Israel and China’s threats in the Pacific are all products of the grand ambitions of evil imperial regimes.

The West has cultivated illusions that have allowed these threats to rise and have left it unprepared. Three in particular are deeply ingrained in the American and European mindsets.

The first is that leaders are responsible for wars and these countries are our rivals only because of their bad leaders. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said of the Ukraine invasion at the United Nations Security Council in September 2022: “One man chose this war. And one man can end it.”

But the war isn’t only Vladimir Putin’s; it is Russia’s war. In a June 2022 poll, 75% of Russians either definitely or mostly supported the actions of Russia’s military forces. One respondent asserted that “war is the locomotive of history” and that it was time for Russia to assert its independence. The Russian Orthodox Church is an instigator of the war and has formed a deep culture of Russian nationalism and imperial entitlement that extends beyond the Kremlin. The result is that Russia can incur massive casualties—recently around 1,000 a day, according to some estimates—without much political backlash.

The hostility of Russia, Iran, China and even Hamas can have deep cultural roots and popular support that allows these actors to engage in lengthy and devastating conflicts. Removing a bad leader or regime doesn’t necessarily turn an enemy into a responsible actor.

The second illusion is that international organizations and global governance can overcome contentious national and regional politics. Because these institutions are the sources of international order for many Western policy makers, the primary objective of their diplomacy is to bring more states, democracies or not, under their pacifying umbrella. President Franklin D. Roosevelt hoped the Soviet Union would behave better once it joined the United Nations and was willing to postpone hard negotiations with Moscow to have it participate in the founding of the U.N. Western leaders hoped China would become a responsible stakeholder in the global order once a member of institutions such as the World Trade Organization.

But like Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China hasn’t become a benign geopolitical actor after participating for more than two decades in the WTO. The formative power of international institutions has been greatly exaggerated, and the grand strategy based on it has left the West unprepared for the hard competition, including war, in front of us.

The third illusion is that greater trade and wealth produce peace. For decades German foreign policy has followed the principle of “change through trade.” Berlin thought trading with Russia, China and other bad actors would ease their hostility and turn them into reliable partners. The U.S. thought that trade with China would gradually alter Beijing’s incentives by creating a peace-loving middle class and deeper diplomatic ties.

The Western bet that expanding trade would overcome ideological differences and political rivalries was wrong. States engage in trade to become wealthy and competitive, not peaceful. Often they want to be wealthy so they can attack their enemies and dominate others. As Russia has done with Europe since Peter the Great, China now is pursuing more trade with the U.S. to gain an advantage over its commercial partner.

Trade also fosters the desire for power. Many states that traded and grew economically as a result developed large power-projection capabilities, most often through navies. Venice in the 11th century, Britain in the 17th, Germany and the U.S. at the turn of the 20th—each backed its commerce with a powerful navy, leading to great clashes.

Military might, not interdependence, gives states the ability to act in their best interests without constraints imposed by other powers. Our rivals have been arming while the West, Europe especially, hoped that trade would render military capabilities useless.

Deep enmities can’t be transcended through leadership changes, international organizations or trade. They can be checked, and when necessary defeated, only through military power.

Nir Dinar, a spokesman for the Israeli military, who on Monday said in response to reports that an Israeli tank had fired on a taxi: “The [Israel Defense Forces] was not shown any proof that this is a civilian car and there’s no information on who is inside….Terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars.” However, on Tuesday, the Israeli military said that Dinar misspoke. In a statement, the military said it “does not operate under the assumption that anyone who approaches is a combatant and have [sic] clear orders to verify, by all means available in the field, that a potential threat or combatant is not a civilian prior to opening fire.” In regard to the shots fired at the car, the statement said, “The circumstances are unclear and the video footage does not give a full picture of the tactical environment nor the circumstances preceding the incident.”

Middle East War Becomes a European Crisis,2023-10-31T22:13:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Dominic Green'],"London

A war in the Middle East is a foreign-policy crisis for the U.S., but it is a domestic crisis for Europe. The streets of London, Paris and Berlin are blocked by marchers calling for jihad. In Brussels, the European Union’s capital, an international soccer match was halted after a Tunisian asylum seeker shot two Swedish fans on their way to the game. Synagogues and Jewish schools are vandalized, and Jews physically assaulted. Police are outnumbered in the streets, undermined by legal activists, and supported only equivocally by politicians.

This is the rotten fruit of decades of mismanaged immigration and a mealy-mouthed failure to reckon with the limits of multiculturalism. Most of the perpetrators aren’t white nationalists. Nor, although the useful idiots of the upper-middle-class left clog the streets and the airwaves, are they environmental catastrophists, angry vegans, or adepts of the trans cult. They are Europe’s fastest-growing religious minority, and its largest bloc of social conservatives: Muslims.

Europe’s left sees the postcolonial world as a moral playground, but liberal Europe has become a stage for the Islamic world’s communal conflicts. The canary in this coal mine wasn’t Jewish; he was an Indian-born British Muslim. The riots, death threats and parcel bombs that followed the publication of Salman Rushdie’s 1988 novel “The Satanic Verses” led European governments to adopt a three-pronged approach. They defined Islamism as a security issue. They tried to reduce fundamentalism by integrating Muslim communities. And they tried to reduce friction by stigmatizing and suppressing the concern of the liberal-minded majority as “Islamophobia.”

The partial success of these policies amounts to failure. Immigration, much of it illegal, has topped up Europe’s reservoir of Islamists, and some of them have committed terrorist atrocities. When governments endorse Islamist gatekeepers as communal interlocutors, as the British did with the Muslim Association of Britain in the early 2000s, they make it harder for Muslims to assimilate. Polish and Hungarian nationalists boast that they don’t have migrant or terrorist problems because they defy the EU on accepting immigrants. Western Europeans, moderate Muslims included, face the consequences of their governments’ institutionalized sanctimony and cowardice.

The French state is already in a struggle with the descendants of its North African colonial subjects. The first pro-Palestinian march after Oct. 7 was so alarming that Emmanuel Macron’s government banned further demonstrations. This didn’t prevent thousands from marching in Paris on Saturday, where they were exhorted by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the communist leader of a resurgent left bloc. When people ignore the law and cheer on mass murder, which is what “Free Palestine” and “From the River to the Sea” mean, there is no doubt who controls the streets. Even before last summer’s riots, polls showed that in a 2023 rematch of the 2022 presidential runoff, voters would choose the ex-fascist Marine Le Pen over Mr. Macron.

“If we are able to deport Hamas supporters, we must do this,” Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said Oct. 20. Ms. Faeser sounds like a member of the hard-right Alternative for Germany, which topped German polls for the first time in early October, but she is a Social Democrat running scared of the voters and her own party’s policies.

Ministers in Britain’s floundering Conservative government also talk tough for similar reasons. Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has told Home Office officials to look into revoking the visas of foreigners who commit anti-Semitic acts or praise Hamas. Perhaps the Home Office can also look into why it gave British citizenship to Hamas leader Muhammad Sawalha. Mr. Sawalha, who was named a co-conspirator in a 2004 money-laundering indictment handed up by a Chicago federal grand jury, is an organizer of London rallies where participants call for “intifada from London to Gaza” and chant the Quranic verse about Mohammed’s extirpation of the Jews of Khaybar. U.K. media are especially offended that the British state gave Mr. Sawalha a discount on his mortgage.

Many Western Europeans aren’t personally invested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In May, YouGov Eurotrack polling across seven European countries found that the conflict matters “not very much” or “not at all” to 73% of Germans, 56% of Britons and 47% of the French. Europeans are, however, deeply concerned about immigration, terrorism, law and order, and overcrowding in welfare, housing, schools and hospitals. The Tunisian suspect in the Swedish soccer fans’ killing was still in Brussels three years after a Belgian court ordered his deportation.

Support for Europe’s nationalist and anti-immigration parties has risen for three decades. Establishment figures such as the archbishop of Canterbury call this democratic movement the return of fascism. Governments can tighten Europe’s already restrictive speech laws, as the head of London’s police suggested in response to calls for “jihad” in London, but they can’t escape a reckoning, socially or electorally, for their failure to control their borders and assimilate their immigrants.

Black Lives Matter and the World’s Oldest Hatred,2023-10-31T22:11:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Jason L. Riley'],"Many who rushed to support Black Lives Matter following the death of George Floyd—professional sports leagues, Fortune 500 companies, placard-waving suburbanites—now seem shocked at how BLM reacted to the Oct. 7 terror attack in Israel. Yet nothing could have been more predictable.

During the previous round of major violence between Israel and Hamas, in May 2021, BLM made its position clear. “Black Lives Matter stands in solidarity with Palestinians,” it tweeted. “We are a movement committed to ending settler colonialism in all forms and will continue to advocate for Palestinian liberation.”

After Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israeli civilians, the same activists were just as unambiguous about which side they were taking and why. While the body count was still being tallied, BLM groups in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington issued statements supporting Hamas’s tactics. “Their resistance must not be condemned but understood as a desperate act of self-defense,” BLM Grassroots in Los Angeles wrote on Instagram. “As a radical black organization,” the post continued, it sees “clear parallels between black and Palestinian people.” BLM Chicago tweeted an image of a Hamas paraglider with a Palestinian flag attached to his parachute and the caption “I stand with Palestine.”

Anyone surprised by this response either hasn’t been paying attention or refuses to take the activists at their word. Organizations such as BLM have done nothing to hide or sugarcoat their animosity toward Israel. In 2016, four years before Floyd was killed by police, BLM released an official platform that referred to Israel as an “apartheid state” and declared that America is “complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people.”

What’s shocking isn’t the rhetoric of BLM leaders in the aftermath of Oct. 7 but that so many people who ought to have known better got played. In 2020, an open letter that endorsed the BLM movement appeared as a full-page ad in the

. It was signed by more than 600 Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, which exists to fight anti-Semitism. If accusing Israel of genocide isn’t defamation of Jewish people, I don’t know what is. Yet Jonathan Greenblatt, the executive director of the Anti-Defamation League, is a prominent defender of BLM.

“There are those who are attempting to smear this movement as inherently anti-Semitic,” Mr. Greenblatt wrote in a September 2020 Medium post. “It is not.” He added that while “some individuals and organizations associated with the Black Lives Matter movement have engaged in antisemitic rhetoric,” it “would be foolish to cede the conversation to the most intemperate voices.”

Mr. Greenblatt and other BLM supporters ignore the reality that black nationalism has long been associated with animosity toward Israel and Jews. The “buy black” campaign of the 1920s, headed by the black nationalist Marcus Garvey, targeted Jewish-owned businesses that Garvey accused of exploiting blacks. Mainstream civil-rights leaders such as Martin Luther King and the NAACP’s Roy Wilkins denounced black anti-Semitism and were vocal supporters of the Jewish State. But Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam were advocates of racial separatism who insisted that Jews brought the Holocaust on themselves and urged blacks to sympathize “completely” with the Arab cause.

In the 1960s, leaders in the Black Power movement denounced King as an Uncle Tom and rejected his goal of assimilation. After becoming head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the mid-1960s, Stokely Carmichael steered the civil-rights group in a more radical direction. This included forcing SNCC’s white workers and volunteers, almost all of whom were Jewish, to resign. When Israel was attacked by several Arab nations in 1967, Carmichael declared that “the only good Zionist is a dead Zionist,” and SNCC published a newsletter that described Israel as an “illegal state.”

In the 1980s, Louis Farrakhan would become America’s most infamous black separatist and anti-Semite, picking up where Malcolm X left off. In the 1990s, Khalid Abdul Muhammad of the New Black Panther Party would continue the Jew-baiting legacy of Carmichael and his 1960s brethren. “I call them bloodsuckers,” Muhammad said in a 1993 address at Kean College of New Jersey. “It’s that old no-good Jew, that old imposter Jew, that old hooked-nose, bagel-eating, lox-eating Johnny-come-lately. . . . I don’t care who sits in the White House. The Jews control that seat.”

The anti-Semitism of the BLM movement isn’t a quirk. The social-media posts and manifestos aren’t coming from a few “intemperate voices” who can safely be ignored to advance some greater good. For BLM activists, the greater good is scapegoating Jews, destroying Israel and exploiting racial division. They are using an old but effective playbook to rally others to their cause. And they are counting on the ignorance, complacency and guilt of white liberals to lend the movement credibility and power.

A U.S. Ultimatum for Qatar: Stop Sheltering Hamas,2023-10-31T22:10:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Richard Goldberg'],"More than three weeks after the Oct. 7 atrocities, Qatar still plays host to Hamas’s “political” leaders, allowing the terror group to coordinate with Iran and pump its propaganda throughout the world. Doha says its relationship with Hamas benefits the U.S. and Israel, providing a channel to negotiate the release of hostages held in Gaza. Rather than indulge this charade, the White House and Congress should issue an ultimatum to Qatar: Shut down all support for Hamas and deliver the hostages, or suffer the consequences.

Qatar’s role in financing Islamic radicalism isn’t new. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , architect of the Sept. 11 attacks, lived in Qatar in the 1990s and reportedly evaded U.S. arrest with the help of Interior Minister Abdullah Bin Khalid Al-Thani . U.S. officials in 2014 identified Qatar as a “permissive jurisdiction” for financing ISIS and the al-Nusra Front, then a Syrian affiliate of al Qaeda. Seven years later, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin reportedly shared intelligence with Washington that Doha had recently sent funds to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Qatar has long been sympathetic to Hamas. When the group won elections in 2006 and Israel and the U.S. subsequently cut off financial support to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Authority, Qatar vowed to provide aid. In 2009, two years after the group forcibly took over Gaza, Hamas leader Khaled Mashal praised Qatar for its support, which at the time reportedly included millions of dollars a month.

As the Syrian civil war stressed Bashar Al-Assad’s relationship with Hamas, the terror group sought to move its political office—a hub for raising funds and coordinating with sponsors—out of Damascus. Qatar rolled out the red carpet. Doha claims the Obama administration asked it to do so—if true, a misguided policy, and one that should be squarely repudiated in the wake of the Oct. 7 atrocities.

The U.S. designated Hamas a terror group in 1997, effectively cutting direct communication with its leaders. By giving the group real estate in Doha, the Qataris enabled a new indirect channel for talks. Since then, Qatar has reportedly provided hundreds of millions of dollars to help Hamas make payroll, deliver social services and generate additional revenue by selling off imported fuel.

For more than a decade some policy makers in Washington and Jerusalem believed Qatar could help moderate Hamas and facilitate a reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority. The savage killing of more than 1,400 Jews disproved that thesis. Qatar’s support of Hamas hasn’t led to the group’s moderation. It’s past time to stop pretending otherwise.

With America’s apparent blessing, Qatar continues to act as if it’s Oct. 6: It has kept Hamas’s office in Doha open and on Oct. 14 hosted a meeting between Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh. Now it’s asserting itself as the only viable interlocutor to negotiate the release of hostages from Gaza. Meantime, the Qatar-funded TV network Al Jazeera serves as the tip of the spear in Hamas’s propaganda campaign, promoting, among other things, the lie that Israel attacked a hospital in Gaza.

Like the arsonist playing firefighter, Doha claims it can be an honest broker in any hostage negotiation, as if the premise of such deliberations doesn’t work to Hamas’s advantage. Recall that Qatar brokered the Biden administration’s recent $6 billion hostage deal with Iran, doubtless a desired model among Hamas’s leaders.

The Qataris’ claim that the West still needs a channel to Hamas should be met with the same hostility that a Swiss banker would meet in 1939 trying to justify continued support to Nazi Germany. Every move Hamas makes today is calculated to win its survival. The operation via Qatar is aimed at pulling on American and Israeli heart strings and undermining Israel’s military operations while creating opportunities to showcase Hamas as humanitarian, not barbaric. This process also buys time for Iran to escalate conflict in other arenas, such as Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Yemen, as the prospect of releasing hostages forces Israel to temper its designs on Gaza.

An alternative strategy could be more successful and less distasteful: Let Qatar know it will be held responsible for the deaths of any additional hostages. The U.S. holds enormous leverage to squeeze Hamas and Qatar to win the release of captives without empowering the terror group or allowing its control of Gaza to endure.

Another tactic: Drop Qatar’s status as a major non-NATO ally and designate the country a state sponsor of terrorism, either by executive order or legislation. Congress could also allow victims of Hamas terrorism to sue Qatar and seize its assets in the U.S. It might go further by mandating that the U.S. Air Force leave the Al Udeid Air Base.

Mr. Biden could also take advantage of the presence of Hamas leaders in Doha by making clear they will be legitimate military targets as long as Hamas holds hostages. Al Udeid has plenty of armed drones that could be brought into action. That threat must be coupled with another understanding: Washington won’t grant any special favors merely for winning the release of hostages. Already, more than 30 Americans are dead.

Israel’s goal is Hamas’s destruction. If the U.S. shares that goal, it can’t tolerate other nations giving aid and comfort to the enemy. Washington must use its leverage to end Doha’s support for Hamas and win the release of every hostage.

Notable & Quotable: BLM and War in Gaza,2023-10-31T22:09:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"Kali Holloway writing for the Nation, Oct. 30:

During the racial justice uprisings of 2020, multiple murals of George Floyd appeared in Gaza and the West Bank. Meanwhile, in the US, Palestinian flags became a common sight at Black Lives Matter protests, and in 2021, the official BLM organization issued a statement declaring “solidarity with Palestinians” and opposition to “settler colonialism in all forms.” That year, The Washington Post wrote that BLM’s influence had “changed the US debate on the Mideast,” increasing support for Palestinians among self-identified Democrats. . . .

Still, I’m begging everyone not to fall for right-wing activist Christopher Rufo’s stated intention to “create a strong association between Hamas, BLM, DSA, and academic ‘decolonization’ in the public mind.” The recent history of BLM’s solidarity with Palestine—and the longer history of Black radicals’ embrace of that cause—is rooted not in rhetoric, but in organizing, mutual aid, and the radical idea that everybody—everybody—has got to be free."
Can the Speaker Sell Ukraine and Israel Aid?,2023-10-31T16:13:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['William A. Galston'],"Don’t tell Donald Trump and the Freedom Caucus, but the new speaker of the House, “MAGA Mike” Johnson, is a strong supporter of continued aid to Ukraine.

In his first full-length interview after being elected speaker, he told Sean Hannity that the Ukraine situation was among his “big priorities,” explaining that “we can’t allow Vladimir Putin to prevail in Ukraine, because I don’t believe it would stop there, and it would probably encourage and empower China to perhaps make a move on Taiwan. We have these concerns. We’re not going to abandon them.” This statement aligns him with the outlook of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , the leader of the traditional internationalist forces among Senate Republicans.

The two leaders disagree on tactics, however. Mr. Johnson isn’t going along with the Biden administration’s request, which Mr. McConnell supports, to link aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and other matters in a single bill costing $106 billion. He announced Sunday on Fox News his intention to proceed quickly with a bill funding only aid to Israel, leaving the remaining issues to be dealt with later. This bill should enjoy overwhelming bipartisan support in the House, though the speaker’s suggestion to offset the cost of assistance to Israel with cuts elsewhere in the federal budget may be a stumbling block. If this bill passes the House, the Senate will have to decide between passing it and insisting on something closer to President Biden’s broader request.

Although the speaker has clarified neither the terms nor the timing of a bill to bolster Ukraine, it isn’t hard to guess this bill’s four likely parameters. First, few elected officials in either party are eager to vote repeatedly on this issue during an election year, so the bill will likely extend assistance long enough to get through the 2024 presidential election.

Second, if the speaker insists on offsetting the cost of aid to Israel, he could hardly do otherwise with an aid proposal for Ukraine that would enjoy much less support within his own caucus. This wouldn’t be easy, because aiding Ukraine will cost more than aiding Israel, even if Congress reduces Mr. Biden’s request. Ukraine’s needs are broader than Israel’s, and the scale of its struggle against Russian aggression is larger than Israel’s fight against Hamas and its backers.

Third, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s insistence that Ukraine no longer receive a “blank check” has broad support among House Republicans, and the new speaker has strong incentives to follow this line. Mr. McCarthy never spelled out what his new policy would mean, but it presumably would include more timely, detailed and transparent accounting for the funds appropriated for Ukraine, along with an intensified fight against corruption, which, despite President Volodymyr Zelensky’s efforts, continues to plague the country’s war effort. Well-crafted oversight measures should enjoy substantial bipartisan support.

Finally, House Republicans have inveighed against the Biden administration, claiming that it cares more about Ukraine’s eastern border than America’s southern border. When negotiating a package to aid Ukraine, House Republicans won’t be satisfied simply to increase funding for current immigration policies, but will insist on tougher border measures as well. If this happens, the Biden administration will have to choose between breaking with the pro-immigration progressives in its own ranks and ending aid to Ukraine. This should be an easy choice, but judging from the administration’s performance on immigration so far, it probably won’t be.

Overcoming these hurdles and passing a bill to aid Ukraine will not end debate on this matter. Donald Trump is the most isolationist leader the Republican Party has had in more than 70 years, and he will speak against aiding a country he views as irrelevant to American interests. Besides, he regards Mr. Putin as someone with whom we can do business and openly admires him as strong and smart. He has made similar remarks about other autocratic thugs such as North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.

If Mr. Trump is the Republican nominee and Mr. Biden the Democratic nominee, Mr. Trump would be up against a committed internationalist whose views were forged in the crucible of the Cold War. Mr. Biden believes that a more democratic world is better not only for people newly emerging from the darkness of autocracy but also for the U.S. There is nothing transactional about his support for Ukraine. The question for him is not what we get right now in return for our investment, but what kind of Europe and world successful resistance to Russian aggression would help build in coming decades.

The internationalists will ask Americans to bear the continued burdens of global leadership, and this will be a hard sell in 2024. It is easy to see the upfront costs of aiding beleaguered friends and allies in distant lands, harder to understand the long-term costs of failing to do so. But one thing should be clear: Abandoning Ukraine would send shock waves through the American-led alliances that have defended democracy and kept peace among the great powers since World War II, with incalculable consequences for us all.

The Battle of Civilization,2023-10-30T22:22:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Benjamin Netanyahu'],"Jerusalem

Until recently, many believed that the promise of progress in the 21st century would enable us to move beyond the barbaric horrors of the past toward a brilliant future—that we could go about our comfortable lives and that evil will simply pass us.

It will not. The horrors that Hamas perpetrated on Oct. 7 remind us that we won’t realize the promise of a better future unless we, the civilized world, are willing to fight the barbarians. The barbarians are willing to fight us, and their goal is clear: Shatter that promising future, destroy all that we cherish, and usher in a world of fear and darkness.

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

This is a turning point for leaders and nations. It is a time for all of us to decide if we are willing to fight for a future of hope and promise or surrender to tyranny and terror.

Rest assured, Israel will fight. Since Oct. 7, Israel has been at war. Israel didn’t start this war. Israel didn’t want this war. But Israel will win this war.

Hamas launched this war by perpetrating the worst savagery our people have seen since the Holocaust. Hamas murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children. They burned people alive, raped women, beheaded men. They tortured Holocaust survivors and kidnapped babies. They committed the most horrific crimes imaginable.

Iran has formed an axis of terror by arming, training and financing Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and other terror proxies throughout the Middle East and beyond. In fighting Hamas and the Iranian axis of terror, Israel is fighting the enemies of civilization itself.

Victory over these enemies begins with moral clarity. It begins with knowing the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong. It means making a moral distinction between the deliberate murder of the innocent and the unintentional casualties that are the inevitable result of even the most just war.

It means holding Hamas accountable for the double war crime it commits every day by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians and deliberately using Palestinian civilians as human shields. It means not only making clear that the use of human shields is an immoral tactic of war, but making certain it is an ineffective one.

As long as the international community blames Israel for Hamas’s use of Palestinian human shields, Hamas will continue to employ this tool of terror. Hamas will continue to use the basements in Gaza’s hospitals as the command posts of its vast terror tunnel network. It will continue to use mosques as fortified military outposts and weapons depots. It will continue to steal fuel and humanitarian assistance from United Nations facilities.

While Israel is doing everything to get Palestinian civilians out of harm’s way, Hamas is doing everything to keep Palestinian civilians in harm’s way. Israel urges Palestinian civilians to leave the areas of armed conflict, while Hamas prevents those civilians from leaving those areas at gunpoint. Hamas is preventing foreign nationals from leaving Gaza altogether.

Most despicably, Hamas is holding more than 200 Israeli hostages, including 33 children. Every civilized nation should stand with Israel in demanding that these hostages be freed immediately and unconditionally.

I want to make clear Israel’s position regarding a cease-fire. Just as the U.S. wouldn’t have agreed to a cease-fire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack on 9/11, Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of Oct. 7.

Calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen.

The Book of Ecclesiastes says that there is a time for peace and a time for war. This is a time for war—a war for our common future. Today we draw a line between civilization and barbarism. It is a time for everyone to decide where they stand. Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until victory.

I hope and pray that civilized nations everywhere will back this fight. Because Israel’s fight is your fight. If Hamas and Iran’s axis of evil win, you will be their next target. That’s why Israel’s victory will be your victory.

Regardless of who stands with Israel, Israel will fight this battle until it is won. Israel will prevail. May God bless Israel, and may God bless all who stand with Israel.

Mr. Netanyahu is prime minister of Israel.

Prepare for an Iranian Escalation,2023-10-30T19:28:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Reuel Marc Gerecht', 'Ray Takeyh']","Iran has patiently built up its “axis of resistance” over 20 years. This alliance among Iran, the Syrian regime, Hezbollah, Hamas and other radical Sunni and Shiite Arab militias is an expression of the Islamic Republic’s vibrant anti-Western ethos. It’s also a means by which the clerical regime can overcome the enormous damage the Syrian civil war has inflicted on its standing among Sunni Muslims. Despite the theocracy’s crucial role in driving Islamic sectarianism, its aspirations to be a vanguard for all Muslims still define Iran’s self-image.

Tehran can’t sit back and watch Israel obliterate Hamas. Fortunately for the clerical regime, its Palestinian proxy in Gaza will be hard to destroy. The farther the Israel Defense Forces advance, the more pressure will mount on the Islamic Republic to expand the conflict. Since the theocracy isn’t suicidal, it will try to calibrate its aggression. Tehran has never been willing to escalate with Jerusalem into direct confrontation. That fear ought to guide both Israeli and American actions.

The Islamic Republic has always relied on terrorist organizations to do its bidding. Since the 1980s, Tehran’s most operationally savvy protégé, Hezbollah, has given the regime the ability to manipulate Lebanese politics and kill scores of its enemies, including U.S. troops. In the aftermath of 9/11, especially after the 2010 Arab Spring, the Iranians fine-tuned their grand strategy. The collapsing Arab state system allowed the mullahs to assemble nonstate paramilitary outfits that they could deploy to various battlegrounds. Iran-aided militias helped evict the U.S. from Iraq, ensured the survival of Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship in Syria, and mauled Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen.

The axis of resistance has transformed the Islamic Republic into the region’s most essential power broker. No government can form in Iraq, Syria or Lebanon without its consent. Iran’s auxiliary forces also deter its enemies. Should Israeli or American leaders consider striking Iran’s nuclear installations, they have to take into account Hezbollah’s formidable arsenal of missiles. And the war in Gaza, for which the Islamic Republic had long been prepping Hamas, has reminded Arab potentates that expanding the Abraham Accords carries enormous risks.

Yet the axis of resistance needs Hamas to survive in some form. Going full martyr—Sunnis die, Shiites watch—would leave Iran caged and embarrassed. Iran’s theocracy has signaled its intent. On his recent tour of the Middle East, Iranian Foreign Minister Hussein Amir-Abdollahian warned: “If the Zionist aggression does not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger.” Nor was he being coy about one set of hands. “The whole world knows that Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah”—Hezbollah’s leader—“is a man of action and has played an outstanding role in securing the region and Lebanon.” There have already been modest clashes on Israel’s northern border.

Behind Iran’s incremental war strategy is a reasoned diplomatic one. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hopes that a gradual expansion of the war might hasten its end. Arabs will protest more. Europeans will dispatch mediation missions. The Biden team, which seems terrified of a larger conflagration, is already encouraging patience in Jerusalem. Washington has been arguing for limited military intrusions that would kill fewer civilians. Anxious Israeli generals, who would need to keep larger ground and air-force reserves for a more active northern front, may start talking again of “mowing the lawn” via periodic small incursions in Gaza, even though that tactic has failed miserably. Mr. Khamenei knows his regime can restore a degraded Hamas. If Hamas loses too much manpower and leadership, however, it might stay dead even if the spirit of resistance lives on.

The trickiest question for Mr. Khamenei is how an escalated conflict would affect the regime’s standing inside Iran. Direct retaliation by Israel, and especially by the U.S., might trigger a chain reaction of discontent with little rallying-around-the-flag effect. The Islamist regime is wobbly. A struggling economy and a rebellious public scornful of Arab and imperialist Islamist causes—Iran’s “forever wars”—weigh on the supreme leader’s decisions. The more direct the U.S. and Israeli threat is to the regime, the more likely that Mr. Khamenei will retreat. An explicit American threat to take the war to Iran would give Israel more breathing room to dismantle Hamas in Gaza, if that’s what Jerusalem decides to do. President Biden’s decision to bring two aircraft-carrier groups into the region helps. He should go further.

What the White House shouldn’t do is quietly warn Tehran not to meddle in Gaza or to unleash Hezbollah. The Islamic Republic is accustomed to back-channel admonishments. America’s armadas have patrolled the Gulf for years without sufficiently changing the mullahs’ calculus. To make a lasting impression on Mr. Khamenei, Mr. Biden needs to declare publicly a red line: Another Hezbollah missile attack on Israel will invite direct U.S. retaliation on Iran. In 2003, when Mr. Khamenei feared the possibility of the Bush administration unleashing its “shock and awe” warfare on Iran, the clerical regime suspended its uranium enrichment. When the perennially unpredictable Donald Trump killed the Islamic Republic’s famed commander Qasem Soleimani, Mr. Khamenei let loose a short missile barrage at U.S. forces in Iraq but went no further.

Iranian escalation this time around is a certainty. Jerusalem and Washington need to deny themselves wiggle room and threaten the clerical regime, not its proxies. This war is going to get worse. It’s past time for Israel and the U.S. to up the ante.

Amalek and Jihad,2023-10-30T19:26:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Eli Federman'],"Amalek was an ancient tribe that Deuteronomy called the Israelites to exterminate. So Benjamin Netanyahu probably shouldn’t have invoked Amalek in his speech about fighting Hamas this weekend. Yet critics who understand Mr. Netanyahu to be calling for genocide commit a serious error.

“Amalek” is commonly used to refer to the Nazis or others intent on exterminating the Jews—in this case Hamas. Mr. Netanyahu’s speech repeatedly referred to eradicating Hamas specifically, and the Israel Defense Force warn civilians before attacking Hamas targets and tries to avoid innocent collateral damage.

The metaphorical use of Amalek throughout Jewish history stands in stark contrast to the Hamas charter, which cites specific Quranic passages that when applied literally call for genocide. Hamas applied these teachings literally on Oct. 7.

The ancient directive in the book of Samuel, instructing Israelites to kill every man, woman, and child, predates Islam by centuries and can’t pertain to Muslims. Recognizing that such mandates have no place in Western civilization, rabbis have long allegorized the concept of Amalek, interpreting it as a fight against symbolic anti-Semitic forces, or even personal struggles for self-betterment. For thousands of years Jews never targeted or slaughtered women and children in the name of defeating Amalek.

Christianity also has a history with justifying violence in the name of scriptural literalism. Matthew 10:34 proclaims that Jesus “did not come to bring peace, but a sword.” Over time, theologians shifted toward understanding the “sword” as a metaphor for the divine word—peaceful proselytization, not violence.

Mr. Netanyahu’s Amalek reference wasn’t arbitrary. In Deuteronomy, it alludes to remembering an enemy that preys on the weak and poses an existential threat to the Jewish people. In 2010 Mr. Netanyahu also referred to the Nazis as Amalek.

When religious texts are interpreted literally, without regard for historical context or modern morality, they can be misused to justify atrocities and division. By favoring metaphorical and allegorical interpretations, societies can extract timeless moral and ethical lessons from these texts.

The trajectory of the current conflict might have been different had Hamas embraced a metaphorical understanding of “jihad.” While Hamas and other extremist groups view jihad as a mandate for a literal holy war, many contemporary Muslim scholars advocate for a symbolic interpretation, framing “jihad” as an inner spiritual struggle.

A shift away from dogmatic literalism toward a more progressive and metaphorical understanding of religious teachings like Amalek or jihad isn’t only advisable; it’s imperative for fostering dialogue, understanding and peace.

Crumbling Train Bridges Are Everywhere. Railroads and Cities Are Sparring Over When to Fix Them.,2023-10-30T11:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Esther Fung'],"Mayor Jared Kraham feared that railroad bridges in his city presented safety hazards for residents. An independent inspection commissioned earlier this year escalated his concerns.

Most rail bridges over public streets in Binghamton, N.Y., were found to be in poor or severe condition, according to the 914-page report. “I thought maybe most were just eyesores,” said 32-year-old Kraham, who began his term leading the city last year. “I didn’t expect it to be so bad.”

Following a toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, earlier this year, mayors and municipal leaders are increasing scrutiny of railroad operations and the infrastructure around their communities. There are more than 70,000 railroad bridges in the U.S. and many of the steel, concrete or timber bridges are showing their age. The structures—some of which were built in the 1800s—play a critical role in the movement of freight nationwide.

Some local leaders are pushing for companies to speed up improvements to rail infrastructure to avert accidents. The officials say they often have to wait for rail bridge owners, typically railroad operators, to make fixes if safety concerns are raised outside of inspections.

In Binghamton,

owns 22 of the 25 bridges that were inspected. The railroad operator said repair work on two bridges is under way and that it would pay to fix other bridges in the coming year. The company also said much of this work was already planned under its regular maintenance program.

Norfolk Southern’s bridge department has shared the details of the planned projects, and is working with the city to expedite construction, a company spokesman said.

“I’m very confident in the structural integrity of our bridges,” Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Alan Shaw said in an interview.

In October, a 65-year-old rail bridge collapsed in Pueblo, Colo., and killed truck driver Lafollette Henderson, also known as “Ace.” The collapse happened after a coal train operated by BNSF Railway derailed owing to what federal safety investigators believe was a broken rail.

“It shouldn’t have happened,” said Tyriece Henderson, son of the late truck driver. “You have to make sure a railroad doesn’t fall on somebody’s father.”

Investigations are continuing.

A BNSF spokeswoman said the railroad is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the structure and will replace the bridge. The bridge’s maintenance was up-to-date, she said.

In June, several railcars derailed and spilled hot asphalt and sulfur into the Yellowstone River in Montana after a railroad bridge collapsed. Montana Rail Link, which is responsible for bridge maintenance, said an inspection was done in May and the bridge was deemed safe. A newly constructed bridge reopened in July.

“They are literally running a business through our towns, and yet they don’t talk to anyone in the town,” said Gary Stevenson, mayor of Paulsboro, N.J. A train carrying hazardous material derailed on a bridge near his home in 2012, and investigations later showed the railroad operator failed to ensure that inspections of the bridge were conducted by qualified employees. The rail bridge was later rebuilt.

Finding help

When Kraham was on the Binghamton mayoral campaign trail in 2021, he heard from residents who were worried about the safety of dilapidated-looking bridges. On a call with the railroads in 2022, Kraham said they told him that they needed more details of the conditions of individual bridges before they could act.

The February derailment in Ohio compelled him to respond to residents’ concerns more quickly, he said. Later that month, the city announced plans to complete bridge inspections and sought support from New York Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Marc Molinaro for its efforts.

The city paid $41,000 to Hunt Engineers, Architects & Surveyors to inspect rail bridges over public streets. In addition to the 22 bridges belonging to Norfolk Southern, three bridges owned by New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway were also inspected.

Twelve Norfolk Southern bridges had significant structural or safety concerns that needed to be investigated, according to the report from Hunt Engineers. Its remaining 10 bridges were rated as fair or good condition.

On four of the bridges, the inspection determined that the structures had columns “in a severe enough condition where complete failure is possible.” The report noted that the bridges exhibited concrete loss, rebar exposure and deterioration at the bottom of the columns.

The three NYSW railroad bridges were rated as poor but weren’t identified as having significant structural or safety concerns.

Rail bridges that show signs of deterioration might still be able to safely carry their loads, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. Corrosion, for instance, isn’t a safety issue unless there is significant loss of material to a critical area.

Inspections didn’t include tests on how much weight the bridge could withstand, said Cristina Donahue, Hunt Engineer’s bridge-design team leader.

Railroads are responsible for inspecting bridges and have to keep their own detailed records on inspections. They also determine the frequency of inspections. Public officials can request a summary of these reports from federal regulators, but the reports often carry few details beyond whether they can safely carry traffic.

Following results from Hunt Engineers’ inspection, the lawmakers sent letters to the railroad, asking it to work with Binghamton—and to the FRA, asking it to conduct its own inspection.

New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Norfolk Southern’s Shaw said that the company is working to improve its relationship with local communities. The railroad in September hired a director of public engagement, a newly created position to marshal resources for issues such as blocked crossings and right-of-way maintenance.

Inspection oversight

The federal railroad regulator is investigating any disparities between Norfolk Southern’s own bridge inspections and those conducted by consultants for the city of Binghamton, an FRA spokesman said.

Rail bridges have to be inspected at least once a year, but those inspections can be done at more frequent intervals or after a severe weather event. Few reported train accidents are the result of bridge misalignment or failure, according to federal railroad safety data over roughly the past decade.

Railroad owners say they understand the economic consequences of neglecting track and bridge maintenance. They have also called for the federal government to provide additional support for upgrades.

The Biden administration has said it would provide $1.4 billion in federal grants to fix and upgrade aging rail infrastructure, including funds for training inspectors. Grantees will receive funds as reimbursement for work that is completed, according to the FRA.

Kraham, the Binghamton mayor, said the proposed work plans that Norfolk Southern presented to the city were the most substantial upgrades the railroad has made in more than three decades. It is also long overdue, he said.

“They are going to do the minimum to keep infrastructure going,” said Kraham. “They are going to grease the squeaky wheel, and Binghamton was the squeaky wheel.”

Israeli Ground Operation Pushes Deeper Into Gaza,2023-10-29T11:58:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Stephen Kalin', 'Chao Deng', 'Omar Abdel-Baqui']","Israeli soldiers pushed at least 2 miles deep into the densely populated Gaza Strip Sunday in moves that analysts said seemed designed to trap Hamas in the enclave’s north, as the U.S. pressured Israel to restore communications in the territory.

Soldiers and tanks appeared to be taking up positions deep inside Gaza on Sunday, two days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was entering a new phase of the war. Tanks fired from Gaza’s Mediterranean beaches, and soldiers moved across open and hilly ground, according to video the military released.

The latest actions suggest a war that is likely to last a long time, as Israel prepares to move deliberately in stages into Gaza territory. At the same time, Israel faces pressure from the U.S. and other Western countries to minimize civilian casualties, which are mounting.

Some evidence of Israel responding to U.S. pressure could be seen Sunday morning, when Israeli authorities restored internet and phone communications after implementing a near complete communications blackout on Friday night. Washington convinced Israel that communications needed to be turned back to allow the United Nations, World Health Organization and other aid groups to coordinate with their staff in Gaza, a senior U.S. government official said.

In a call Sunday with Netanyahu, President Biden pushed for increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and said that protection of civilians is a priority. “I reiterated that Israel has every right to defend its citizens from terrorism and a responsibility to do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law which prioritizes the protection of civilians,” Biden wrote on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter.

In recent days, the White House has also embraced the idea of humanitarian pauses, which stops short of a cease-fire. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the U.S. is prepared to support humanitarian pauses so that hostages held by Hamas can be released safely.

’s Face the Nation. “But you can bet that Hamas will try to use that time to their advantage as well.”

The Israeli ground invasion is expected to focus initially on Gaza City, where much of Hamas’s infrastructure and weaponry is believed to be located, said Mairav Zonszein, senior analyst on Israel-Palestine at the International Crisis Group. Israel’s leaders have said the main war aim is the destruction of Hamas as the ruler of Gaza, where it came to power 17 years ago.

Israeli forces have to go in deep to access the group’s extensive underground tunnel network, she said. “There already is and will likely be a long-term ground invasion,” she added, but what it can realistically achieve “is still in question and constantly evolving.”

Israel’s military has been silent about its strategy and tactics but a growing part of the country’s security establishment has called for what Naftali Bennett, the former Israeli prime minister, called “strategic patience.” On Sunday, Bennett said the army should encircle Hamas in Gaza City and lay a long-term siege, instead of quickly sending forces into urban combat.

“Make the passing time work in our favor,” he said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “We have all the time in the world.”

A siege in the north could ensnare tens of thousands of civilians who haven’t fled to the south. Already, Israel has largely cut off food, water, fuel and electricity for the two million residents of the territory. Israeli leaders have said it won’t be a short campaign.

The Israeli military advances occurred on the same day that Netanyahu apologized for a social-media post blaming Israeli intelligence agencies for failing to warn him of plans for the Oct. 7 attacks. He deleted the post after lawmakers and journalists condemned him for it.

As the north Gaza Strip increasingly turns into a battlefield, Israel has urged Palestinian civilians to move south. But Palestinian and international observers have said that frequent airstrikes including in the south, destroyed infrastructure and dwindling supplies are hindering movement within Gaza and taking a heavy toll on noncombatants, including children.

Thousands broke into U.N. food warehouses in central and southern Gaza, the organization said Sunday, taking wheat flour and other basics such as hygiene supplies. The raided facilities included a store holding supplies from aid trucks that had recently arrived from Egypt, the U.N. said.

“This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza. People are scared, frustrated and desperate,” said Thomas White, a director at the U.N.’s agency for Palestinian refugees.

Just over 80 trucks have brought supplies into Gaza since the conflict broke out earlier this month, which the U.N. has warned is a fraction of the enclave’s needs. Israel said Sunday that aid deliveries to Gaza’s south would expand. A senior U.S. government official said the United Nations could handle as many as around 100 trucks carrying food and medical supplies each day, and that Israel had agreed to accelerate aid.

Rami Hijjo, a former humanitarian worker in Gaza and father of three, said people were selling their belongings and even fighting to get water. He said he couldn’t find bread on Sunday. He said he was planning to go to the bakery on Monday at 5 a.m. to stand in line and get one pack of bread that will last him for a day. On other days, he will try to buy water.

A two-day communications blackout ended on Sunday, with internet and phone services gradually restored, according to service providers and digital monitoring groups.

A senior U.S. official said Israel had taken steps to shut down Gaza’s phone and internet communications, but the U.S. successfully convinced Israel to reverse those measures.

Israel’s Defense Ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The telecommunications blackout left people in Gaza unable to reach family or the outside world and made it harder for emergency services to operate, humanitarian groups said.

Abdalrahim Abuwarda, a 30-year-old master’s student at the University of Wyoming, was able to speak with his family on Sunday after some communications were restored in Gaza.

“I am so relieved to know that they are alive,” Abuwarda said. “I was worried sick about them.”

Some of his family has stayed put in northern Gaza, while his wife and children are sheltering now with relatives in the southern town of Khan Younis. “The situation in the north is more terrible than ever,” Abuwarda said.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society said that it had been told by the Israeli military to evacuate Gaza’s al-Quds hospital, a demand it said was impossible to meet. Red Crescent spokesman Raed al-Nims said that there were patients on life-support machines as well as 12,000-14,000 displaced people taking refuge there.

“People are still there, and they will not leave. They have no place to go, as there is no safe place. At least, this is the safest place for them,” said al-Nims.

The Red Crescent Society later said Israel conducted airstrikes near al-Quds Hospital, forcing patients, medical staff and displaced people to evacuate the hospital and causing significant damage to some departments.

The Israeli military declined to comment on al-Quds hospital. It said separately that it is planning to increase humanitarian assistance to Gaza this week, and that it is preparing a zone in the southern region of Khan Younis that it said could accommodate hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by military operations. Several residents have said they don’t trust the Israeli military’s promises of a safe zone after it told people to relocate from the north of Gaza to the south for their safety and then bombed southern areas.

The U.N. opposes the forcible movement of civilian populations, and aid groups have raised concerns about humanitarian relief being used to encourage mass displacement.

The Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry has said that more than 8,000 people, a majority of whom are women and children, have been killed in Gaza since fighting began. The U.S. and Israel acknowledge that thousands of people have been killed in Gaza, but have expressed doubts about the accuracy of Hamas numbers on civilian casualties. Some U.N. experts have said that the actual toll could be higher because the numbers don’t account for bodies still under the rubble.

Israel has mobilized hundreds of thousands of reservists following the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas that left more than 1,400 people dead.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Antisemitic Comments Increase Across Chinese Social Media,2023-10-29T17:52:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Liyan Qi'],"The Israeli Embassy in Beijing this month. China has sought a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.

As war erupts between Israel and Hamas, a wave of antisemitic comments is sweeping through China’s social media.

In recent days, searches and mentions involving the phrase “anti-Jew” skyrocketed on the Chinese app

The acrimony has reached as far as “Schindler’s List,” the 1993 movie about a German industrialist who tries to save his Jewish employees from the Holocaust. In recent days, the film was hit with a flood of bad reviews on video-streaming site

and movie-review platform Douban. Some reviewers said they had changed their mind about the movie since the recent violence had occurred. “I used to like the movie, but now it looks more like a story about the farmer who saved the snake,” one Bilibili commenter said.

The rising anti-Jewish sentiment on social media dovetails with Beijing’s more pronounced support for the Palestinian cause since the war began and its distancing of itself from Israel, a U.S. ally.

China, which has sought to portray itself as a neutral party and peacemaker in global hot spots, has called for a cease-fire in the Mideast conflict. Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, who has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy since the war broke out, urged his Israeli counterpart in a call on Oct. 23 to “respect international humanitarian law and protect the safety of civilians.” In a separate call to the foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority, Wang expressed “deep sympathy over the difficult situation in Palestine, and especially with the people of Gaza.”

Beijing hasn’t condemned Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which stunned the world and started the recent round of violence.

“You may find all types of comments on social media in this information age. But ultimately, it is what the government of a country says officially that counts,” Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a written response. “We believe the pressing priority is to de-escalate and prevent a more serious humanitarian disaster from happening” he said, adding that China hopes a resolution of the conflict will address “all parties’ legitimate security concerns.”

Since the Oct. 7 attack, China’s government-run media have focused on the Israeli response, sometimes with selective or incomplete information. State media reporting on a hospital explosion in Gaza have mentioned Palestinian claims that Israel was behind the attack but not intelligence and video footage suggesting the opposite: that the hospital was hit by a failed rocket meant for Israel.

As a result, many social-media attacks aimed at Jews and the Jewish state have been driven by footage of injured children and other horrors in the aftermath of the hospital blast. “Bombing a hospital and killing children is genocide. Forget all the movies and shows about Jews’ sufferings,” a user wrote in a comment on Chinese microblogging platform

, which received nearly 4,000 likes.

Partly what makes the wave of resentment notable is China’s history as an occasional haven for Jews. During World War II, thousands of Jews fleeing persecution in Europe ended up in Shanghai as well as the northern city of Harbin. In the discussion of where to establish a Jewish state in the aftermath of the war, both were mentioned as possibilities. To this day, remnants of synagogues are reminders of the connections.

Until recently, Chinese government officials have touted China’s historic goodwill toward Jews. At a pop-up exhibit in New York in August highlighting how Shanghai became a wartime refuge for about 20,000 Jews, Huang Ping, China’s consul general in New York, said that Chinese and Jewish people have been getting along for a thousand years.

The Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York in 2017 dubbed an exhibit about the Jewish presence in China as “China: a Land Without Antisemitism.”

Matt Trusch, a Jewish American fund manager focused on real-estate projects who lived in Shanghai for more than a decade, said he often encountered stereotypes about Jews in China, usually framed in positive terms, with admiration of Jews as being good at business, but said he has never seen this level of resentment.

Trusch has been posting videos in Mandarin on the video-sharing site Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, to debunk some of the stereotypes. His top video about friendship between Chinese and Jewish people, posted last year, attracted more than eight million views, with emojis of hearts and hands clapping in the comment field.

More recently, his business partner in Shanghai, whose phone number is listed in the Douyin account profile, has been receiving hate messages and threatening phone calls.

Some social-media commenters urged the Chinese authorities to dismantle the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum, established in 2007 to preserve artifacts of Jewish refugees in China during World War II. Others mentioned an unusual police presence outside the museum since the war began.

This month, state broadcaster China Central Television posted on its short-video account a clip from a 2020 program called “Uncovering the Israel Element of U.S. General Elections,” which included a remark by the host that “Jews, who represent 3% of the U.S. population, control 70% of its wealth.” A hashtag the state broadcaster created around that purported factoid was one of the top trending topics that day, getting nearly 100 million views on Weibo.

The signs of a shift in Chinese sentiment coincide with rising nationalism and anger at the West, especially the U.S. A review of English-language posts by Chinese official accounts on various platforms shows efforts by state media to paint the U.S. and its allies as warmongering forces behind conflict in the Middle East, said Jessica Brandt, a policy director at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.

Many nationalist-leaning influencers have also fueled anti-Jewish sentiment. One influencer, with more than half a million followers on Douyin, said China shouldn’t shelter Jews displaced by crises in the future. The post received 170,000 likes.

Yaqiu Wang, a research director at Freedom House, a nonprofit group based in Washington that tracks the global state of democracy, said years of crackdown on civil society in China have successfully silenced many who acted as a balancing force in online debates.

“These haters are vocal but that doesn’t mean everyone is thinking like that in China,” Wang said. “People who think differently don’t voice their opinions anymore.”

Troves of comments online, including some supporting the Nazi persecution of Jews, prompted the German Embassy in China to say it would remove comments including hate speech on the embassy’s social-media account and permanently block commenters who glorified the Nazi period or compared Israel to Nazi Germany. “Germany unfortunately experienced the era of raging Nazism. We are deeply aware of what that means,” the embassy said in a Chinese-language statement on its account.

After the sudden flood of bad “Schindler’s List” reviews, many rushed to the movie’s defense, giving it five-star ratings and helping restore its ratings average. “We should be against the neo-Nazis, not the Jewish people,” one commenter said.

Following the escalation in Gaza, Qatar is in contact with all parties, urging calm. Our international partners such as the U.S. have asked us to mediate to secure the release of more hostages. We have been engaged with Israel, other countries and Hamas. The release of several hostages as a result of Qatar’s mediation is a positive step, but the situation remains delicate.

It is therefore deeply unsettling that false narratives about Qatar have emerged in the media with the apparent intention of escalating the conflict. These narratives create obstacles for constructive mediation efforts and aim to derail negotiations. Almost as soon as the conflict began, Qatar became the target of a sustained disinformation campaign about the nature of our role as a mediator for peace in the region. These campaigns have spread falsehoods about the purpose of the Hamas political office in Doha and the financial aid that Qatar provides to Palestinians. “Commentators” assert that Qatar is a funder and sponsor of Hamas—which is untrue.

The Hamas political office in Qatar was opened in 2012 after a request from Washington to establish indirect lines of communication with Hamas. The office has frequently been used in mediation efforts, helping to de-escalate conflicts in Israel and the Palestinian territories.

The presence of the Hamas office shouldn’t be confused with endorsement but rather establishes an important channel for indirect communication. Qatar’s pursuit of dialogue has always been conducted in coordination with our international partners, and our priority has always been peace and stability in our region. Further, all humanitarian aid from Qatar to Gaza is delivered directly to Palestinian families, while additional Qatari funding provides electricity to power the homes of Gaza’s two million people. Qatari aid is distributed in full coordination with Israel, the U.S. and United Nations agencies such as the World Food Program and the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. It is subject to strict guarantees and controls along its route through Israel into Gaza.

The release of several hostages over the past week shows that Qatar’s policy of engaging with all sides can yield positive results. Avoiding the further loss of civilian lives and securing the release of hostages should be the priority for all. Open channels of communication can lead to lasting peace. Qatar will continue to pursue such engagement, supported by the U.S. and other partners around the world.

A Saudi-Israeli Peace Deal Isn’t Dead,2023-10-29T16:22:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Karen Elliott House'],"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

When Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz met to establish U.S.-Saudi relations in 1945, the king never shared with anyone the memorandum of their conversations, believing that his friendship with FDR depended on goodwill and good faith, not a scrap of paper.

Now his grandson Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is the kingdom’s de facto leader, and he is actively trying to revive Saudi-U.S. friendship by doing the opposite. The crown prince seeks a formal Senate-ratified treaty codifying a new set of mutual commitments between Riyadh and Washington.

The translator for Abdul Aziz’s meeting with FDR later revealed that the king had given the president his advice about European Jewish survivors of the Nazi genocide: “Give them the choicest lands and homes of the Germans who oppressed them.” Instead, in 1948 FDR’s successor recognized the new Jewish state in Palestine. Saudi Arabia never did.

That would change under the prospective new U.S.-Saudi agreement, which would include Israel as a third party. The war in Gaza complicates matters, but the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia are still talking in an effort to create a new, economically integrated Mideast by bringing the dynamic Arab state into overt peaceful relations with Israel. In exchange, the U.S. would sign new trade, security and nuclear-enrichment deals with Riyadh, which would make some pledges of its own, possibly involving oil.

That the three parties continue to hold out hope is a sign of how much both Saudi Arabia and Israel believe their cooperation could transform the region. It was never going to be easy. At any time, groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have the capability to cause chaos, as Hamas did with its Oct. 7 attack against Israel.

Yet the optimism now for an Israeli-Saudi peace is rooted in the hopelessness of the current Mideast. Israel’s military might and strong U.S. support proved insufficient to guarantee the Jewish state’s security. Iran and Hamas are exploiting the Palestinian issue to undermine public support for Israel across the region, and even in the U.S., where university campuses have hosted violent anti-Israel demonstrations. Perhaps, this thinking goes, the horrors of today’s Mideast will motivate all parties to take previously unthinkable steps to resolve the Palestinian issue and secure widespread Arab cooperation in building a more integrated and prosperous region.

There is a narrow line between motivation and wishful thinking, and the Saudis are anxious for an early end to hostilities. Officials are telling the Biden administration and a visiting delegation of 10 U.S. senators to persuade Israel not to invade Gaza or do anything that will prolong or widen the war. A short look at the horrors of war could create new determination to take risks for peace, but prolonged exposure to death and destruction could also breed a new generation of angry Arabs who block Saudi-Israeli rapprochement. Today’s young Saudis, a majority of whom are under 30, have never seen war as their parents and grandparents did in 1967 or 1973. But if this current war drags on, with television and social media emphasizing Palestinian casualties in Gaza, young Saudis could be aroused against Israel.

To keep hope alive, Crown Prince Mohammed is doing all he can to maintain business as usual in Saudi Arabia. When Hamas’s false claim that Israel bombed a Gaza hospital led to massive street demonstrations across the Mideast, Europe and U.S. college campuses, Saudi Arabia remained quiet. To be sure, demonstrations are risky in an authoritarian state. But a visitor here sees no signs that Saudi citizens are exercised over events in Gaza. The crown prince has set out the parameters for his citizens by condemning the targeting of civilians, calling for creation of a Palestinian state, and ignoring Hamas to support the rival Palestinian Authority.

Last week the crown prince hosted the president of South Korea, and both attended the Future Investment Initiative, an annual three-day confab that draws Wall Street titans and thousands of international visitors. “The Phantom of the Opera” opened in Riyadh, and the city is hosting golf’s Ladies European Tour and a world heavyweight boxing match. At the same time, Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militia fired drones and missiles across the kingdom toward Israel. But a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted them all—a vivid reminder of the importance of U.S. military might in the Middle East.

Foreign-policy observers here believe—or at least hope—that Iran wants to avoid direct involvement in this war because any attack by Iran on Israel surely would prompt retaliation from Israel and could draw the U.S. into hostilities. For its part, Saudi Arabia is doing everything possible since restoring diplomatic relations with Iran this summer to avoid inflaming Tehran. Still, it’s hard to imagine Iran would simply accept a new U.S.-Saudi-Israeli pact to cooperate in the Mideast at Iranian expense.

With war clouds covering much of the region, one thing is clear. Saudi Arabia, having flirted with China and Russia, recognizes that the U.S. is its best—its only—security option. Whether that will lead it to recognize the Jewish state in the current environment is unclear. But if lawmakers put aside their negative perceptions of Saudi Arabia to ratify a deal, it will be because Israel throws its support behind Riyadh.

"Ambulances, Terrorism and the Face of Evil",2023-10-29T15:01:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"GAZA CITY, GAZA - OCTOBER 11: Damage is seen on an ambulance belonging to the Palestinian Ministry of Health after Israeli Air Force planes bombed the area on October 11, 2023 in Gaza City, Gaza. Almost 800 people have died in Gaza, and 187, 000 displaced, after Israel launched sustained retaliatory air strikes after a large-scale attack by Hamas. On October 7, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel from Gaza by land, sea, and air, killing 1000 people and wounding more than 2000. Israeli soldiers and civilians have also been taken hostage by Hamas and moved into Gaza. The attack prompted a declaration of war by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In “Your Periodic Reminder That Evil Is Real” (op-ed, Oct. 25), Lance Morrow writes of Hamas’s massacres as well as the story of an ambulance from the West Bank whose trip to transfer Mr. Morrow’s friend to an Israeli hospital was delayed for longer than necessary by Israeli soldiers at the border. Those soldiers were wrong, and I’m sorry—no excuses.

I am also sorry that the border patrol has to stop ambulances at all. This was necessitated when Palestinians started using ambulances to smuggle weapons and explosives into Israel. In January 2002, a Palestinian Red Crescent paramedic, Wafa Idris , blew herself up in Jaffa Road, Jerusalem, killing one old man and injuring nearly 150. In May 2002 in Ramallah, in the West Bank, a bomb belt was discovered hidden under a 6-year-old boy, who was being transported in a Palestinian ambulance to a hospital in Israel. The bomb was discovered at a checkpoint and disabled. The child was then transported to the hospital in an Israeli ambulance."
Biden’s Only Salvation: A New Vice President,2023-10-27T19:30:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Holman W. Jenkins'],"The obvious solution is for Joe Biden to get a new vice president. No offense to Kamala Harris, who, for all I know, may be supercompetent at everything except the parts of the job the public can see. In the best of circumstances, she’d be the wrong vice president now—too domestic, too ticket-punchy—for a country facing international dangers with a superannuated president.

You saw this week what inevitably must follow. A vacuum exists when a president is Mr. Biden’s age and shows it. Barack Obama filled it. What president doesn’t return to his home state after his term to give his successors elbow room in D.C.? Mr. Obama doesn’t. His $8 million mansion in Kalorama Circle is built for entertaining. Just because the media practices unusual discretion about it doesn’t mean he isn’t holding court.

When Mr. Biden has just returned from a war zone and given a prime-time address, what sort of predecessor decides it’s his job to provide a lengthy policy statement of his own a few days later? The sort who is Mr. Obama. In a second term, Mr. Biden would be the lamest of ducks, dogged by polls showing voters doubting his stamina for the job. Would Mr. Obama be any more self-effacing? Don’t believe it. The only solution for Mr. Biden is to fill the vacuum himself—by naming a veep nominee of undoubted forcefulness, seen by all as ready to take over when global events are running out of control.

Is that person Gavin Newsom, who was in China this week to get his picture taken with Xi Jinping for no reason other than to show some leg for possible Democratic king makers? Is it Lloyd Austin, a retired four-star general, now Mr. Biden’s defense secretary? He needed a special congressional waiver to receive his current job. Progressives squealed. They would squeal again. Good. The country would see the seriousness with which the administration is making sure America remains in capable hands regardless of Mr. Biden’s capacity to do the job.

Events have forced off the front pages Mr. Biden’s one big vulnerability, Hunter Biden, at the expense of accentuating another, his age.

I’m not sure the public should be quite ready to write off Hunter’s significance just yet. What Joe did or didn’t do is ancillary. The issue became, overnight, the disconcerting eagerness of our institutions to corrupt themselves in the Hunter mess, from the Justice Department and IRS to the FBI and intelligence services.

You have to serve somebody, as Bob Dylan said: Whatever Merrick Garland tries to pretend, a pattern of actions by his Justice Department buried the possibility of a tax charge or court proceeding focused on Hunter’s Ukraine earnings while Joe was vice president.

You have to serve somebody: A conspiracy of former intelligence officials framed a foreign power and lied to the American people about the Hunter laptop to help Joe get elected.

You have to serve somebody: Our press has been willing to justify almost anything to keep Mr. Trump out of the White House, yet its surrender of standards is his biggest asset. As honest Democrats now admit, Joe is likely to get the GOP opponent he loudly proclaimed he wanted. Why? Because the Russia collusion hoax trained Mr. Trump’s voters to see the criminal charges piled up against him as just another law-enforcement conspiracy.

Mr. Biden, if he writes his memoirs, might claim independent actors not under his control fabricated the laptop misdirection. He may say he was merely emoting as any father would when, as president, he insisted in the hearing of his Justice Department his son had done nothing wrong.

But the truth is, Mr. Biden could have interrupted the chain of causation. He could have let the chips fall when the laptop surfaced. He could have owned up to the impropriety of his son’s actions. He could have, as I pointed out at the time, required a completely plausible mea culpa from Hunter for shopping the “big guy’s” name to Chinese investors without his father’s knowledge or approval.

Those MSNBC dingbats who bleat “but Joe loves his son!” must not have had parents. I’m pretty sure my parents loved me but they didn’t feel the need to defend my every bad decision. True, 50 years in the rough and tumble might involve anybody in a tangle of ethical compromises. Mr. Biden’s 50 years are also his major asset, covering a multitude of sins. I’ve heard top Democrats speak dismissively of his abilities and yet pull up short because five decades of Washington experience have a quality of their own. In 2024 Mr. Biden might be the best America can do. If so, all the more important this time is bringing along a vice president who can inspire confidence well before voters are required to go to the polls and make a choice.

Biden Administration Tries to Soften Blowback From Muslim Leaders in U.S.,2023-10-27T01:51:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Sabrina Siddiqui', 'Tarini Parti']","President Biden speaking with reporters during his return from Israel aboard Air Force One last week.

WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is making public and private efforts to address concern from some Democrats, including Arab and Muslim leaders, over its staunch support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.

President Biden met with Muslim-American leaders at the White House on Thursday, as his administration expressed more openness to backing a temporary pause in the conflict to get humanitarian aid into Gaza and renewed calls for a two-state solution.

Biden’s closed-door meeting with Muslim-American leaders, who support a cease-fire, came days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken met separately with members of the Jewish-, Arab- and Palestinian-American communities. The discussions followed criticism from many Muslim and Arab-American groups over what they see as an inadequate response by the Biden administration to mounting civilian casualties and a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Ahead of the meeting, the president showed more support for the Arab world in recent comments than he did in the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 assaults, reaffirming his support for a two-state solution and denouncing Israeli settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank at a press conference Wednesday.

But the administration’s effort to reassure communities that could play a key role in Biden’s re-election campaign has faced challenges.

In his comments, Biden cast doubt on the death toll in Gaza and suggested the loss of innocent Palestinians was the cost of war, prompting a fresh wave of anger among Muslim- and Arab-Americans. The White House doubled down on the comments Thursday, noting that Hamas controls the Gaza health ministry and that civilian casualties are inevitable in war. The United Nations and some international humanitarian agencies consider the numbers broadly accurate.

Biden’s meeting with Muslim civic and political leaders, although billed as a discussion on efforts to combat anti-Muslim views, included a robust discussion of the situation in Gaza, according to an attendee.

Participants told the president he needed to show more empathy and compassion for Palestinians and draw a more direct connection in public between Israeli policies and the rights and suffering of civilians in Gaza, the attendee said. They also called for a cease-fire, while sharing their view that a military solution wasn’t feasible.

Rami Nashashibi, the lone Palestinian-American in the group and executive director of the Inner City Muslim Action Network, in Chicago, said he told Biden “how profoundly harmful” it was for the president to cast doubt on the death toll in Gaza. “It induced a sense of alienation—a sense of dehumanization that Palestinians feel that our lives don’t matter,” Nashashibi said, recalling his message to Biden.

Attendees said Biden appeared sympathetic and receptive to their concerns but didn’t make any commitments around a cease-fire. The president also said he meant to say he didn’t trust Hamas when talking about the death toll in Gaza but acknowledged it wasn’t interpreted that way, according to a person familiar with the discussion. The White House declined to comment.

The meeting also was attended by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison; Wa’el Alzayat, the chief executive of Emgage, a group that seeks to turn out Muslim voters; and Suzanne Barakat, whose brother was killed in 2015 in what prosecutors called a hate crime.

Before the meeting, tense deliberations ensued between invitees and community organizers over whether to participate in the meeting, because it didn’t include Palestinian-American leaders who work on humanitarian issues. Some former administration officials and community organizers said they provided recommendations to White House staff that included Palestinians who had lost family members in Gaza, but felt their recommendations were ignored.

A White House official said Palestinian-Americans who lost family members in Gaza have participated in meetings with senior White House staff over the past few weeks and suggested such communications would continue.

Also joining the meeting were prominent Muslims in the administration—Dilawar Syed, deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration; Rashad Hussain, U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom; White House liaison to Muslim communities Mazen Basrawi; and White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi.

Biden has sought to draw a distinction in public between Hamas militants and ordinary Palestinians, and his administration has worked to get humanitarian aid into Gaza through its border with Egypt. The president’s top national security advisers, Jake Sullivan and Jonathan Finer, have held meetings with Muslim- and Arab-American leaders to discuss their concerns during the conflict.

The administration faces international and domestic pressure in support of a cease-fire. Although the administration is resisting calls to back such a step, Blinken and the National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, have said a humanitarian pause should be considered.

Leaders in the Mideast, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and the United Nations secretary-general have called for a cease-fire. U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said recently he backs “specific pauses,” and European Union foreign ministers are debating whether to support a humanitarian cease-fire or a pause.

A group of House Democrats filed a resolution calling for immediate de-escalation and cease-fire in Israel and occupied Palestine, and dozens of celebrities, including some major donors to Biden’s campaign, sent a letter to the president asking for the same thing. While not explicitly calling for a cease-fire, former President Barack Obama urged caution in a statement, saying “any Israeli military strategy that ignores the human costs could ultimately backfire.”

A Gallup poll released Thursday found that Biden’s job approval rating among Democrats fell 11 percentage points in the past month to 75%—the lowest from his own party during his presidency. The survey didn’t directly tie the drop to Biden’s handling of the conflict, but it noted that the results “strongly suggest that Democrats’ approval of Biden fell sharply in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas and Biden’s promise of full support for Israel on the same day.”

Gallup has previously found Democratic sympathies in the Mideast have been shifting to Palestinians over the years.

A Wall Street Journal/Ipsos poll conducted last week found that 42% of those surveyed said the U.S. should side with Israel, while 52% said the U.S. shouldn’t back either Israel or the Palestinians. Democrats were about evenly divided on whether the U.S. had a responsibility to help Israel fight, according to the poll.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
A Refusenik in a Country at War,2023-10-27T16:35:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Tunku Varadarajan'],"‘Avital! Avital! Avital!” Natan Sharansky calls out his wife’s name in quick and anxious succession, the last time in a loud bellow. Minutes into our interview by Zoom from his house in Jerusalem, he’s worried his grandchildren haven’t had lunch. “Because of the war, everybody is crazy,” he says. “My son-in-law is in the war, so all the grandkids are here”—eight in total, ranging in age from 1 to 13, the children of his daughters, Hannah and Rachel. “It’s a good time to fuel yourself on family love.”

An Israeli politician and human-rights advocate, Mr. Sharansky was once the best-known refusenik—a name for Soviet Jews who were denied permission to emigrate to Israel. In February 1986, he became “the first political prisoner released by Mikhail Gorbachev .” He served as a cabinet minister in every Israeli government from 1996 to 2005, including a stint as Ariel Sharon ’s deputy prime minister from 2001 to 2003.

Before emigrating to Israel, he spent nine years in Soviet prisons accused of treason. He’s 75 but jokes that he’s 66: “My nine years in prison don’t count.” He also quips that between his “nine years in prison and nine years in government, my years in prison were easier.” In 2009 he rebuffed an invitation to join the cabinet of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “I was in four governments, and I resigned twice. I was in four prisons, and I never resigned. It shows there is something wrong with me in politics.”

The grandchildren are fed. The war has come home, literally, to the Sharanskys, as it has to almost every household in Israel. “I just met a woman whose four sons are in the army,” he says. “It was a big mobilization today—everybody who’s from 20 to 38.” Israel is united in tragedy and resolve. “Maybe that’s what makes it a little bit easier to overcome this awful pogrom.”

In Mr. Sharansky’s opinion, Hamas’s atrocities eclipse “even the worst Russian pogroms” of the 19th century. This was also “the first pogrom in history which was all on the internet. They were making pictures and sending them out immediately.” Hamas terrorists were proud of this, he stresses. “It says something to us that even the Nazis tried to hide their killing from the world. Here they tried to show to all the world what they were doing to these Jews.” They believed it would “win sympathy and support from one part of the world, and understanding from the other part.”

The former part is the Islamic world—including Muslim populations in Europe—where massive crowds came out in support for “the Palestinians.” The latter part is the Western left. Mr. Sharansky finds the reaction on American campuses “mind-boggling”: “A pogrom occurs, and the first reaction is that Israel is to be blamed. They see the most barbaric pogrom since the Holocaust as the beginning of Palestinian liberation.”

Anti-Israel demonstrations intensified after a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza on Oct. 17. Hamas blamed Israel instantly and much of the world was quick to accept the word of a terrorist organization, some holding to this view even after proof emerged that the damage was caused by an errant rocket fired by Palestinian terrorists.

Why does Israel never get the benefit of the doubt? “The simplest answer is to say that that’s anti-Semitism,” Mr. Sharansky says. He accepts “legitimate criticism” and notes that “Israel is a free country.” But he says Israel is seldom denounced in good faith but instead subjected to the “three Ds”: demonization, double standards and delegitimization.

Add to this the ideology that holds “the oppressed are always right, and that resistance to oppressors is always legitimate.” Intellectuals, academics and college leaders “refuse to call the most primitive act of anti-Semitism by its name,” and instead dignify the Hamas murders as a form of “anticolonial” struggle.

But aren’t the Palestinians oppressed? “Well, I would say that Palestinian people are oppressed by the ruthless dictators and terrorists who rule over them. And the free world—including some of my leaders, in my own country—are accomplices. If there is one crime against the Palestinians to which Israel should plead guilty,” Mr. Sharansky says, “it is the Oslo Agreement”—the peace accord Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed in 1993.

Mr. Sharansky abhors Oslo. Still regarded in some circles as the touchstone of Israeli-Palestinian compromise, the agreement handed control of Palestinian land to Yasser Arafat’s Palestinian Authority in the belief that he would be able to subdue Hamas. “I’m not against compromises with the Palestinians,” Mr. Sharansky says. “I’ve said I’m for a two-state solution from the moment I came to Israel. I want Palestinians to have the same rights as I, but they should never have an opportunity to destroy me.”

At Oslo, he says, Israel foisted “a ruthless dictator on the Palestinians. We told them, “Like it or not, he will be your leader.’ With [Bill] Clinton and all the free world, we gave Arafat the power to destroy all the beginnings of freedom of the Palestinian people and helped build a generation of haters.” Mr. Sharansky says it’s “absolutely ridiculous” that a “fifth generation” of Palestinians lives in refugee camps, but he says “their leaders are to blame. And the free world, that gives money to these leaders—a lot of money.”

Mr. Sharansky is certain that Israel’s security can be assured only by a free Palestinian society, in which people “enjoy a normal life, normal freedom, the opportunity to vote and have their own human rights.” In “The Case for Democracy” (2004), he wrote: “I remain convinced that a neighbor who tramples on the rights of its own people will eventually threaten the security of my people.” The book was published a year before Israel “disengaged” from the Gaza Strip, withdrawing the army and forcibly uprooting Jews who had settled there.

That decision led Mr. Sharansky to resign from Sharon’s cabinet. Arafat had failed to tame Hamas, and Mr. Sharansky believed Gaza would be taken over by the terrorist group, whose ideology is “suicide for the sake of destroying the state of Israel.” He resigned before disengagement took effect, because he didn’t want to “take responsibility for the fact that we, by our own hands, were creating the biggest terrorist base in the Middle East, and that missiles will come one day to Ashkelon,” a coastal city less than 10 miles from the Gaza border.

“The threat was so clear to me,” Mr. Sharansky recalls. “But Sharon told me, ‘No, we simply put up a wall. And if [Hamas] dare to make one shot, we will simply kill all of them.’ To this day, I don’t know if he believed in it or not.” Mr. Sharansky recalls that Sharon told him that “all the world will be with us for 10 years after this. I said, ‘Arik, you don’t have 10 years. Maybe you have 10 days.’ ”

In the event, Hamas won legislative elections in Gaza in 2006 and displaced the Palestinian Authority by force the next year. Although Mr. Sharansky’s view appears to have been vindicated, he doesn’t think “now is the right time for me to say that I was saying this or that. It’s too long ago. But what was disengagement? Leaving the territory, and leaving it to the terrorists. Nobody in Israel would be for a new disengagement today.” After the atrocities of Oct. 7, “all of Israeli society understands that there can be no compromise with Hamas—or we will survive or they will survive.”

What now? “After we finish Hamas, of course,” he says he would push for some of the measures he advocated at the time of disengagement. “You don’t want to control these two million people, right? We have to go back to what I was proposing before, that we have to build some kind of international army.” This won’t happen overnight, so for “the transitional period, military control has to be in our hands,” but only for a few years. An international body—comprised, preferably, of Saudis and Emiratis (“all those rich countries who recognize our right to exist”)—would have to help the Palestinians build “an independent economy, a normal education, normal housing, a civil society.”

Mr. Sharansky projects a 10-year timeline for such an alternative, at the end of which Gazans could “elect representatives who are really concerned about them, with whom we can negotiate.”

Mr. Sharansky, born in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk, has been an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin’s war on the land of his birth. Does he make a connection between the defense of a free Ukraine and support for Israel? “Putin’s invasion is a threat to the free world,” Mr. Sharansky says. “Ukraine fighting for its identity, for its right to be a Ukrainian democratic state, is defending the free world.” Israel, too, “for all these years, has been fighting for its right to be a Jewish democratic state, which is also in the interests of the free world.” Both peoples’ fight for survival highlights “the connection between freedom and nationalism.” He says he means nationalism not “as a four-letter word, or Putin’s imperialistic nationalism, but one that asserts your right to live as one people in freedom.”

The Netanyahu government has faced criticism for failing to support Ukraine and perhaps even tilting toward Russia. The usual explanation is that Israel is constrained to cooperate with Russia to keep things from spiraling out of control with Iran, these days among Mr. Putin’s closest allies, especially in Syria, where Russia has a military presence. “It’s absolutely ridiculous,” Mr. Sharansky says, “that Israel is fighting Iran and tries to appease Russia, and America is fighting Russia and tries to appease Iran.”

But Mr. Putin has declined to support Israel in the wake of Hamas’s attack, and Mr. Sharansky thinks that “that’s the end of illusions about Russia in Israel.” The former refusenik, who lived with Russian anti-Semitism until he was 38, has often said Mr. Putin is a rare Russian leader who isn’t an anti-Semite. He hasn’t changed that opinion: “He’s a dictator. He is a war criminal. He has to be brought to trial. But who is an anti-Semite?”

An anti-Semite, Mr. Sharansky says, is “one who persecutes or hunts Jews for being Jews. I’m very critical of Putin, on the one hand, and on the other, I’m saying he’s not anti-Semite. What to do? Every anti-Semite is in some way a villain. But not every villain is an anti-Semite.”

As recriminations fly against Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Sharansky cautions against precipitate calls for his resignation. Many blame the prime minister for ignoring warnings from Egypt of an imminent Hamas attack. “Look,” Mr. Sharansky says, “for this exact reason there will be an investigation. In Israel, even small battles are studied minute by minute. What happened? What was right? What was wrong? Here, there will be huge investigations. There will no doubt be a committee of the most respected judges and war specialists who would analyze the failure of intelligence—military and political.”

No one denies that “everybody who was at the top was responsible, in one way or another. You can’t say that the head of intelligence is responsible, but the prime minister is not.” But Israel’s success in identifying and killing “so many leaders of Hamas who are hiding” proves that “we restored our intelligence practically immediately. From the feeling that we lost everything in 24 hours, you already have a feeling that your intelligence is working.”

Credit for the “quickest mobilization,” he says, “goes to the people, of course, but it’s also because of our leaders. So this is definitely not the moment to say, specifically, that the prime minister, or this minister, or this leader, has to resign.” Such action, says Mr. Sharansky, is “only for after serious investigation. Right now, we have to win the battle. And Bibi and our army are leading us in this effort.”

"Gaza Hospitals, Shelters Cut Back on Services as Fuel Runs Short",2023-10-27T03:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Chao Deng'],"As Gaza runs out of fuel to power its generators, hospitals in the besieged Palestinian enclave fear they will have to turn away patients and unplug lifesaving machines. Shelters housing tens of thousands of families are switching off the lights. Bakeries are shutting down.

“The situation is getting worse day by day, hour by hour,” said Mohammad Aburayya, a 47-year-old doctor, who has been sheltering with his family at a United Nations facility for nearly two weeks. “I don’t remember the last time I saw electricity.”

On Friday, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said that basic services were crumbling, medicine was running out, food and water were scarce, and sewage had begun overflowing on the streets of Gaza.

“Our aid operation is crumbling and for the first time ever, [my colleagues in Gaza] report that people are now hungry,” said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the agency. “Civil order is collapsing, and anger starts to be channeled towards my colleagues. How long can we last? No more than a few days.”

He said that the U.N. facilities were forced to drastically limit consumption of fuel at a cost to services and urged Israel to let in more aid. “Many argue that aid cannot enter because of aid diversion. Let me be clear. We have solid monitoring mechanisms,” Lazzarini said.

Israel cut off all supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity to the Gaza Strip in response to the Oct. 7 attacks by militant group Hamas that killed 1,400 Israelis. It allowed the delivery of small amounts of humanitarian aid to Gaza starting last Saturday but Israel has opposed the delivery of fuel to Gaza out of concerns that Hamas would use it for military purposes.

A spokesman for the Israeli military said that the thousands of rockets Hamas is firing at Israel show that Gaza has plenty of fuel. He also pointed to a now-deleted post on social-media platform X by the U.N. agency that it had received reports of people purporting to be from the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza taking fuel from the agency’s compound in Gaza City. The agency later said that no such looting took place.

The Israeli military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said this week that efforts would be made to provide access to fuel in Gaza where needed, without allowing it to reach Hamas, but didn’t provide more details.

Electricity was scarce in Gaza even before the war. Roughly one-third of the strip’s electricity supply came from a power plant that ran on industrial diesel fuel imported from Israel, while two-thirds came from electricity lines that extended from Israel, according to Gisha, an Israeli nonprofit organization focused on Gaza. Residents and businesses relying only on the municipal electricity grid got power for roughly 12 to 15 hours a day.

People who could afford it used backup generators that were also dependent on imported diesel, during long power blackouts. Many hospitals, businesses and other facilities, including households, also installed solar panels for electricity.

Now, aid and rights groups are warning of a complete blackout, at a time when the enclave’s more than two million people are under intensifying airstrikes by Israel. The Hamas-controlled Health Ministry said Thursday that 7,028 people had been killed in Gaza. The figures couldn’t be independently verified.

Already a dozen out of 35 hospitals in Gaza and around two-thirds of 72 primary healthcare clinics have shut down due to damage from airstrikes or lack of fuel, according to the U.N.

At Gaza’s largest hospital, Al Shifa, lights in the corridors and nonclinical areas have been switched off. “The only places running 24 hours a day are the operating rooms and intensive care units,” says Ghassan Abu Sittah, a British Palestinian reconstructive surgeon from Doctors Without Borders who is working there.

He estimated that roughly one-third of around 1,600 patients would die should the generator go out. “Between those in intensive care and those who need repeated surgeries…there is no plan,” he said.

Yousef Abu Al-Rish, deputy minister of the Palestinian Health Ministry, said that it has been calling on people to give any fuel to hospitals. The ministry has asked the police to requisition fuel from gas stations.

Israel says Hamas has enough fuel but isn’t distributing it to civilians. Earlier this week, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee posted a photo on X of a fuel storage location in Gaza near the Rafah border crossing. “This is what over half a million liters of diesel looks like,” but “Hamas keeps claiming it does not have enough fuel to support hospitals, bakeries,” he wrote.

Salama Marouf, head of the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza, disputed Israel’s claim and said the fuel belonged to gas-station owners in Gaza.

According to Gisha, more than 30 million liters of diesel fuel entered Gaza in August alone.

Israel never supplied Gaza with power for free, said the nonprofit group’s executive director, Tania Hary. Before the war, the Qatari government financed the diesel supply for Gaza’s sole power plant, while the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, paid for the electricity that Gaza received from Israel via the electricity lines, she said.

The World Health Organization, with the support of the U.N., delivered 34,000 liters of fuel on Tuesday to four major hospitals in southern Gaza as well as the Palestine Red Crescent Society to sustain its ambulance services. However, it warned the fuel was only enough for a little over 24 hours.

Richard Brennan, regional emergency director for the eastern Mediterranean at the WHO, said that the WHO and the U.N. haven’t been able to get security guarantees from Israeli authorities to deliver fuel from reserves already in the strip to hospitals in northern Gaza. “We keep advocating, keep pleading,” he said.

A spokeswoman for Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Of more than 1.4 million people in Gaza who have had to flee their homes, nearly 630,000 people are sheltering at 150 U.N. designated shelters, according to the U.N. At many locations, generators are being directed to keep only the water stations running and the toilets flushing, to conserve fuel.

The wife and five children of Aburayya, the Palestinian doctor, fled their home in Gaza City on Oct. 13 for a U.N. facility in Khan Younis. With around 30,000 people on the site, the family has been sleeping outside on blankets and eating canned food but regularly skipping meals.

Aburayya struggles to charge his phone, as charging stations at the center are crowded with people guarding their devices. After sunset, the premises turn completely dark.

“The bathroom is the worst part because it needs electricity and water,” said his 18-year-old daughter Maryam. “Neither works well.”

Elsewhere, bakeries are going out of business due to lack of fuel and continued airstrikes. Roads were emptying of cars. Many doctors have been biking to work.

The price of whatever fuel there is left has soared. Gas was $5 per liter compared with around $1.70 earlier this week, said Mohamed Sharif, a taxi driver in Gaza City. He spent five hours before he found one liter. Since then, his car has been parked and he has moved from location to location trying to find shelter.

Beshara Shahada, a 61-year-old owner of the Families Bakeries Company in the Rimal neighborhood in central Gaza, closed his bakery on Tuesday after running out of diesel for his oven. After standing in a line that stretched for several blocks, people left hungry and empty-handed.

“We are waiting for the government or any aid agency to send us fuel, but there’s nothing we can do,” he said.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Israel Tries to Part the Fog of War,2023-10-26T22:32:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Peggy Noonan'],"This is about describing and showing and making things clear. In the fog of war these things are never more essential.

Here is some first-rate describing, from Ruth Margalit in the New Yorker, in a piece called “The Devastation of Be’eri.” Be’eri is a kibbutz three miles from Israel’s border with Gaza. Hamas terrorists came there as Oct. 7 dawned. There were more than 100 of them, wearing camouflage and green Hamas bandannas. Many came on motorcycles, and all were heavily armed. Many cried “Allahu Akbar!”

Ms. Margalit wanted to know what the individual attackers looked like. She quotes an eyewitness description: “Like they had just come out of the gym. With crazy joy in their eyes, like they were high on something.” It’s the kind of statement you read and immediately know it was true. They were sleek young men, hopped up and murderous.

It tells you a lot about their purported cause. It tells you who they are.

This week we learned more about their actions. We learned it in large part because it wasn’t enough that the terrorists did it; they had to memorialize it. Some of them wore body cameras and took cellphone videos. The Israel Defense Forces compiled a video record, which also included footage from Israeli security cameras and dash cams, and showed it at a military base near Tel Aviv. Hundreds of journalists came. They were asked not to reproduce the 43-minute video but were free to describe what they saw.

From Graeme Wood in the Atlantic: “Men, women and children are shot, blown up, hunted, tortured, burned, and generally murdered in any horrible manner you could predict, and some that you might not.”

A man and his young sons are in their pajamas: “A terrorist throws a grenade into their hiding place, and the father is killed. The boys are covered in blood, and one appears to have lost an eye. They go to their kitchen and cry for their mother. One of the boys howls, ‘Why am I alive?’ and ‘Daddy, daddy.’ One says, ‘I think we’re going to die.’ The terrorist who killed their father comes in, and while they weep he raids their fridge.”

An IDF spokesman at the screening was unable to say whether the boys survived.

A terrorist uses a phone to call his family in Gaza. “I killed 10 Jews with my own hands,” he tells his father. “Put on Mom! Your son is a hero!” He tells them to open WhatsApp to see his pictures.

Andrew Neil of the Spectator wrote on social media: “Other footage shows IDF soldiers beheaded with their lifeless corpses left splayed in the streets.” The BBC noted the “stark detail” of the “sheer horror.” Hamas gunmen cheered with joy as they shot unarmed civilians on the road. There was “an attempt to decapitate someone who appeared to be still alive using a garden hoe.”

Isabel Kershner of the

described a litany of images: “An emergency medical worker pouring mineral water from a bottle to douse the smoldering remains of charred bodies. . . . Brutalized young women, one of them naked. . . . Victims are seen gagged. . . . Faces are frozen in shock and agony. Women’s bones are broken, their legs twisted in impossible angles.”

Later, the Twitter account of the Israeli government showed clips of their interrogation of Hamas prisoners. One is asked what his mission was in Be’eri. “To conquer,” he replied. (The warriors now prisoners seem to be admitting people were murdered but denying they did it, blaming the other guy in the battalion. Interestingly, a few of them expressed resentment toward the leaders of Hamas, who live in luxury while they fought in the field. This managed to sound both rehearsed and genuine.)

Why did Israel put together these pictures and sounds and show them to reporters? There is already copious testimony from eyewitnesses and survivors. Hamas has never bothered to deny what it did. But the world needs proof it can’t forget or sweep away. This includes Hamas’s supporters in the U.S. and elsewhere.

But also: It happened. If it happened, you have to show it. Big history is coming, in which Israel will be saved or not saved, and you owe it to history to tell what tipped the world into this moment.

Anyway, the IDF did a first-class job of telling. Here is one way it can continue. All wars are of course now propaganda wars, and maybe always have been—“Bleeding Belgium” was more than a century ago. But now the propaganda is instantaneous, worldwide and expertly produced. The Israelis lost a big propaganda battle in the story of the Gaza hospital. By the time they and American intelligence were able to counter Hamas’s accusations, the Arab street had exploded. And yet Israel did the right thing: It didn’t immediately deny Hamas’s claims, it said it was investigating, gathered the data, presented it to the world, and its explanation—that it was an errant terrorist missile—was in the end widely accepted.

The Israelis played it straight. They should keep playing it straight, adopt it as a strategy. If they do, it will be understood in time that Israel’s communications apparatus is the only one that can be trusted. This will matter a great deal down the road. There will be temptations along the way to lie, fudge or dodge because nations at war make mistakes and blunders. There are misjudgments, accidents and failures. But something tells me that in this war you won’t be able to fight propaganda with propaganda, only truth.

I end with the observation that we are seeing a fairly stark generational divide over all that’s happening. Speaking generally, if you are middle-aged or older, chances are good you feel sympathy for and old loyalty toward Israel. The young are more prone to antipathy toward Israel, sometimes accompanied by rage, sometimes by almost violent accusations against the colonialist oppressor state. At the bottom of today’s progressive politics there is blood lust. They speak of justice and equity but that’s not what they want, they want dominance. It’s all about the will to power. Progressive students have absorbed the idea it’s good to be militant in your views, it shows you’re authentic. No, it shows you got the talking points.

I was with a more peaceable group the other night at the Al Smith dinner, the big annual bipartisan dinner of the Catholic Archdiocese of New York. One of the speakers, Mary Erdoes, told the audience that anti-Semitism appears to be on the rise and our friends need to know who’s with them. There was an envelope at each plate, she said, and if you open it you’ll find a blue lapel button. Wearing it is meant to show identification and affiliation with our brothers and sisters. Suddenly at that madly noisy dinner, all you could hear was one sound, envelopes being torn open, and the sight of buttons being affixed.

It was a great moment of making it clear.

Friendship Is Precious. ‘Allyship’ Is Treacherous,2023-10-26T21:09:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Tevi Troy'],"Oct. 7 was the worst day of my life, as it was for Jews around the world. Seeing so many Jews slaughtered is difficult to comprehend. Like so many Jews, I also had family members on the front lines on that horrific day.

In this challenging time, I have been comforted by words of support from many non-Jewish friends. Some of their messages are short, others longer. These friends say they are thinking of me, that what happened sickens them, and that they stand with Israel.

Some of these people are in regular contact with me. Others I haven’t heard from in years. Some reached out immediately. Others waited a week or two, then apologized for taking so long.

The messages and conversations have been helpful not only to me but also to my relatives in Israel with whom I have shared their sentiments.

Not everyone is so fortunate. I mentioned this outpouring of support to a progressive Jewish woman I know, and she looked stricken. She has heard nothing of the sort from her left-wing “allies.” No messages, no thinking-of-yous, no expressions of sympathy.

Her experience isn’t anomalous. One man lamented on Twitter: “I am a liberal, a social justice warrior, a woke believer that people should feel safe in all spaces. And I am a Jew, and I expected that my liberal colleagues would accept me as a Jew, and protect me as I have them. But I’ve been let down, and now I am alone.” Frequent Israel critic Rabbi Sharon Brous described from the pulpit similar feelings of “existential loneliness.”

News articles document this phenomenon. Jonah Goldman, a 31-year-old progressive who as a college student was involved with J Street, a Jewish group that is stridently critical of Israel, told the Los Angeles Times that “the left in America has really let us down.” Joanna Ware of the progressive Jewish Liberation Fund told the

that “it has been painful to see some people I consider friends or comrades seeming to have a hard time empathizing with Israelis and, by extension, Jews in the United States.”

Hearing these stories is heartbreaking. I take no solace in thinking that as a conservative I have friends who are more apt to support Israel. Nor do I revel in the idea that many progressives have chosen friends who not only were fair-weather “allies” but view the world through the simplistic lens of oppressor vs. oppressed—with Jews in the oppressor camp.

This unfortunate designation matters. It means that nothing Jews do to defend themselves can be justified, and all actions in opposition to them—no matter how savage—are allowed.

To those with this worldview, progressive Jews are at best temporary allies to be discarded the moment they choose their heritage over their politics.

I am tremendously grateful to my friends who stand with me and with Israel. As for my fellow Jews who are in the progressive camp, I hope in the future they will be able to find more comfort in friendship than in “allyship.”

Campus Radicals and Leftist Groups Have Embraced the Idea of ‘Settler Colonialism’,2023-10-26T09:30:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Adam Kirsch'],"After the Hamas attack that killed more than 1,300 Israelis on Oct. 7, many Americans were indignant to see academic and left-wing organizations issuing statements that excused or implicitly endorsed the massacre. Such sentiments are not surprising, however, to anyone who follows the way Israel and Palestine have long been discussed in those quarters. An idea widely accepted in a small ideological community has now been exposed to the view of the general public, revealing the deep estrangement between them.

The idea in this case is “settler colonialism,” a term that appears often in the pro-Hamas statements collected by the Anti-Defamation League. Various chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America have decried “settler-colonial, Zionist apartheid” and called to “decolonize Palestine—from the river to the sea,” a slogan that, by invoking the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, calls for the elimination of the state of Israel. Mondoweiss, an online publication, published an opinion piece by Jeff Halper calling the Hamas attack “part of the Palestinians’ century-long struggle for liberation” from “Zionist/Israeli settler colonialism.”

Like all theoretical terms, “settler colonialism” can mean different things to different people. But most who use it would probably agree with the definition offered by Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute: “a system of oppression based on genocide and colonialism, that aims to displace a population of a nation (oftentimes indigenous people) and replace it with a new settler population.” The paradigm case is the European colonization of the Americas, where over centuries many indigenous peoples were displaced or killed as Europeans took their land.

On this view, the Jewish state is only one example of a type of regime that must be combated around the world, including in the U.S. Truthout, another far-left publication, writes that “an understanding of settler colonialism remains essential for anyone seeking to make sense of daily injustices in Palestine and in many other places, including the U.S.” The same analogy underlies the statements issued by several local chapters of Black Lives Matter, identifying the struggle against American racism with the cause of Hamas. “We are also freedom fighters who have been grossly mislabeled and violently targeted for standing up against injustice to our people,” said BLM Phoenix on social media.

What makes settler colonialism a potent political concept is that, as the Cornell definition says, it is “a system rather than a historical event.” In other words, the displacement of the indigenous population is not something that happened centuries ago but something that is still being perpetrated today, by all the non-indigenous inhabitants of the land and by the culture and institutions they have created.

The Southern Poverty Law Center makes this point clearly in its magazine Learning for Justice: “Understanding settler-colonialism means understanding that all non-Indigenous people are settler-colonizers, whether they were born here or not. Understanding settler-colonialism as both a historical position and a present-day practice helps students see how they fit into a settler-colonial system—and how that system shapes the impact of their actions, regardless of their intent.”

This principle makes today’s anticolonial ideology more radical than the anticolonial movements of the post-World War II era. At that time, national liberation struggles in Africa and Asia were directed mainly against European powers that did not settle the territories they ruled. When the Viet Minh fought the French in Vietnam, or the Congolese National Movement fought the Belgians in Congo, they wanted to reclaim national sovereignty from foreign rulers who had no connection to the country other than the right of conquest.

Freeing a settler-colonial society is a very different prospect, since it would presumably mean expelling many millions of people who were born in the land they are said to have colonized. Modern Jewish settlement in what is now Israel began in the 1880s, English settlement of North America in the 1600s. If the descendants of those first arrivals are still considered settlers in 2023, then the word no longer has its ordinary meaning. Instead it is a permanent, inheritable marker of guilt, like “bourgeois” as a class label in the Soviet Union.

Under the workers’ regime, a bourgeois was not a person who owned a certain amount of property, but anyone whose background indicated that they might be hostile to the working class. That put them outside the realm of moral concern, and they could be killed for any reason or none. The reaction of many anticolonial activists to the massacre of Israelis suggests that a similar logic is at work today.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think of the way academic and leftist groups have responded to the Israel-Hamas conflict? Join the conversation below.

Even advocates of anticolonial ideology know that there is no prospect of actually “decolonizing” the U.S. The most they hope for is symbolic expressions like Native American land acknowledgments, which have become standard practice at many academic and arts institutions. These statements are often historically ill-informed, but they are not really about historical facts. They advance a political thesis: that in a just world, every territory would be occupied only by the people who belong there.

Ironically, while anticolonialism conceives of itself as a progressive, left-wing ideology, this understanding of the relationship between people and land is similar to that of fascism, which was also obsessed with the categories of native and alien. The Nazi slogan “blood and soil” conveyed the idea that German land could only truly belong to its primeval inhabitants.

Anticolonialists would of course reject this analogy. But they are proudly indebted to Frantz Fanon, the Martinique-born French writer whose analysis of anticolonial struggle was born from the Algerian rebellion against French rule in the 1950s. For Fanon, a psychologist, anticolonial movements must be violent, not only because they lack other means of achieving their goals but because violence itself is redemptive and therapeutic. “The colonized man finds his freedom in and through violence,” Fanon wrote in his classic 1961 book “The Wretched of the Earth.” “For the colonized people this violence, because it constitutes their only work, invests their characters with positive and creative qualities.”

When Western sympathizers excuse or endorse the actions of Hamas, it is because they see it in these terms, as a liberation movement fighting a settler-colonial regime. And it is true that Hamas frames its struggle in terms of indigenous rights and redemptive violence—though sympathizers usually overlook the fact that it understands these things in religious fundamentalist terms, which are totally incompatible with other left-wing commitments like LGBTQ rights.

The group’s charter, adopted in 1988, declares that only Muslims are indigenous to the land that is now Israel, so Jews can never belong there: “The land of Palestine is an Islamic endowment consecrated for future Muslim generations until Judgment Day.” Likewise, it states that “peaceful solutions…are in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement” and that “there is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad.”

Hatred of settler colonialism, like hatred of capitalism among communist revolutionaries, believes that it is morally impeccable because it is grounded in genuinely moral instincts: indignation at violence and oppression, hope for freedom and equality. It seems perverse that such instincts should lead to approving the mass murder of children and the elderly.

But like other totalizing ideologies, anticolonialism contains all the elements needed for moral derangement: the permanent division of the world into innocent people and guilty people; the belief that history can be fixed once and for all, if violence is applied in the right way; the idea that the world is a battlefield and everyone is a combatant, whether they realize it or not.

Most observers of the conflict in Israel-Palestine, regardless of whose “side” they are on, don’t fall into these traps. But those who do are increasingly vocal—a bad sign for the future of peaceful coexistence, and not only in the Middle East.

Indian Muslims Flunk the Israel Test,2023-10-25T22:47:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Sadanand Dhume'],"The Hamas attacks in Israel this month presented the world with a stark test of moral clarity that the leaders of India’s 200 million Muslims appear intent on flunking. Their refusal to condemn the terrorist group’s savagery, or in some cases even to acknowledge it, is exceedingly foolish. It will fan fears of Islamic extremism among India’s Hindu majority and drive away the centrist allies Indian Muslims need to safeguard their rights.

Indian Muslim political and intellectual elites have adopted a fanatically one-sided approach to Gaza that has fueled pro-Palestinian protests in Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, Bangalore, Aligarh and Hyderabad, among other Indian cities. The journalist Tavleen Singh summed up the situation in India in a widely shared column that bemoaned Muslims who “have come out in passionate support of the besieged people of Gaza” without “expressing any horror at what Hamas did and without showing the smallest understanding of what Israel has just gone through.”

The speaker of the southern state of Kerala’s legislature called Hamas’s well-documented orgy of rape and murder “resistance,” not terrorism. Asaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim politician from Hyderabad, had no harsh words for Hamas, but he condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “a devil” and “a war criminal.”

“To call this reaction terrorism is to strengthen the oppressors,” said Khalid Saifullah Rahmani, president of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a group of prominent Islamic clerics and scholars. At the same time, the social-media feeds of prominent Indian Muslim journalists, lawyers and “fact checkers” have devolved into anti-Israel propaganda channels. False information is rife, including repetition of the debunked claim that an Israeli airstrike destroyed a hospital in Gaza.

Criticism of Israel also stands in contrast to the relative silence on the harsh mistreatment of Muslims in other countries. Why does China’s persecution of Uyghur Muslims or the Turkish army’s cutting off electricity to civilians in northern Syria barely rouse Indian Muslims and their leftist allies? This makes their obsession with the Jewish state, which conducts military operations with more concern for civilian casualties than most countries, look extremely selective.

Nobody should begrudge Muslims—or anyone else—their concern about civilian deaths in Gaza. But the lack of empathy for Israeli suffering in attacks that marked the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust reveals several pathologies with wider implications. India’s most prominent Muslims—along with many of their leftist supporters—can’t grasp that Oct. 7 marked a turning point in history. They can’t put themselves in the shoes of victims of Islamist violence or see why noisy rallies for a cause tied in the public imagination to a brutal terrorist group could appear insensitive and threatening.

If the ethical implications don’t rattle Indian Muslims, the political ones should. Pakistanis too have defaulted to religious tribalism almost universally in addressing this conflict, but they can afford to in a way Indian Muslims can’t. It’s just as morally bankrupt for Fazlur Rehman, a prominent Pakistani cleric, to hail the Hamas violence as a “historic success” as it is for an article in the Indian Muslim newspaper Milli Gazette to praise the terrorist group for having “shook the world.”

Mr. Rehman enjoys widespread domestic support for his Israel derangement syndrome. Everyone from trendy Karachi socialites to angry mullahs in Peshawar shares the same maniacal hatred for Israel. Since Hamas’s attacks, Pakistanis have taken to the streets in Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore, Multan and Gujranwala, among other places.

Indian Muslims, on the other hand, account for only about 14% of the country’s population. They risk significant political blowback for their elites’ callous response to Hamas’s barbarism. Prior to the Oct. 7 attack, the Hindu nationalist movement that has controlled India’s national government since 2014 already often viewed India’s Muslim minority as threatening aliens, not as fellow citizens who happen to practice a different faith.

Restrictions on interfaith marriage imposed in some Hindu-nationalist-run states were premised on the paranoid delusion that Muslim men marrying Hindu women is a sort of religious warfare. Likewise, state governments controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party have imposed harsh penalties for beef consumption, and some BJP politicians publicly justified vigilante mob attacks on Muslims suspected of working in the cattle trade.

Against this backdrop, Indian Muslims’ publicly embracing respect for the dignity of all human life—whether Muslim or Jewish—would not only be the best moral position but also the most pragmatic. The strongest arguments to treat Indian Muslims fairly are rooted in the liberal democratic constitution that India enacted in 1950. It’s those principles that led many centrists—of all faiths—to stand with Muslims who opposed a 2019 law to fast-track naturalization that pointedly excluded Muslims.

By turning their backs on Jewish suffering, Indian Muslims are rejecting the universal values that their enemies seek to undermine. Muslim politicians and intellectuals who can’t see this are doing their people no favors.

The Disgrace of the United Nations on Israel,2023-10-25T16:53:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['The Editorial Board'],"In the ever-expanding hall of shame for propagators of global disorder, prepare a special pedestal for United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres . His disgraceful remarks Tuesday to the Security Council are an example of why the U.N. can’t be counted on to keep the peace anywhere.

Mr. Guterres’s comments amount to nothing less than an apologia for Hamas terrorists, despite a few thin caveats. “It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum,” he said of the Iran-backed terror group’s Oct. 7 invasion of southern Israel, which claimed more than 1,400 lives.

Lest anyone miss his point: “The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished.”

Although he allowed that these “grievances” don’t justify the “appalling attacks by Hamas,” he warned that “those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.” We quote Mr. Guterres at length in case readers assume someone in his position couldn’t really have delivered a speech of this sort. He did.

Mr. Guterres seems to know little about the institution he leads. A U.N. resolution passed in 1947 recommended the partition plan for Palestine that led to the creation of Israel the following year, as our friends at the New York Sun note in a sharp editorial.

Meanwhile, for decades the U.N., under the auspices of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) refugee agency exclusively for Palestinians, has discouraged permanent resettlement by refugees and runs schools that teach children Israeli territory belongs to them.

Far worse is Mr. Guterres’s parroting of what amounts to a modern-day blood libel that Israel is indiscriminately killing Palestinian civilians. The Israel Defense Forces more than a week ago tried to warn Gazans to flee the likely path of an invasion; Hamas discouraged civilians from doing so and the U.N. criticized . . . Israel.

Civilians are dying because Hamas deliberately targeted Israelis and now uses Gazans as human shields, as Mr. Guterres had to acknowledge Tuesday. By calling for Israel to accept a cease-fire, Mr. Guterres is effectively rewarding the terrorists’ civilian-killing strategy while denying a U.N.-approved state the same ability to defend itself that every other country enjoys.

This false equivalence elevates Mr. Guterres’s comments to the destructive from merely foolish. His message to the world’s rogues is that if you go on a killing spree, the U.N. will help justify your depredations. Will Mr. Guterres concoct some excuse if Beijing invades Taiwan—or Philippine territory? This is how the U.N. makes itself a fellow traveler in the advancing march of global disorder.

Notable & Quotable: Sullivan on the Middle East,2023-10-25T22:11:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan writing for the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs (these passages were deleted from the online version, published this week):

The president inherited a region that was highly pressurized. . . . U.S. troops were under regular attack in Iraq and Syria. . . . Such attacks, at least for now, have largely stopped. . . .

The Israeli-Palestinian situation is tense, particularly in the West Bank, but in the face of serious frictions, we have de-escalated crises in Gaza and restored direct diplomacy between the parties after years of its absence. . . . We have acted militarily to protect U.S. personnel, and we have enhanced deterrence, combined with diplomacy, to discourage further [Iranian] aggression. . . . The progress is fragile, to be sure. But it is also not an accident.

The region is quieter than it has been for decades.. . . [Mr. Biden’s] approach returns discipline to U.S. policy. It emphasizes deterring aggression, de-escalating conflicts, and integrating the region."
Can Israel Win the Messaging War?,2023-10-25T20:59:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Daniel Henninger'],"“The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation.”

—António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, Oct. 24

Political opposition has become a learned reflex. Whatever you’re for, I’m against. End of story. But the fact that this same political reflex kicked in hours after Hamas’s videotaped mass slaughter of innocents on Oct. 7—the assertion that somehow Israel drove Hamas to do it—begs for examination.

There was a time years ago when one explanation would be that people weren’t fully aware of the scope or physical details of such mass killings. Consider the difficulties at the start of World War II to convince some in the West, notably in the U.S., that a plan to exterminate Jews was under way in Germany and Poland.

Today omnipresent mass media and personal video make it impossible to be ignorant of atrocities of the sort that occurred in southern Israel. There is no excuse not to know the details. A striking summing-up of all we have seen and heard was given on Fox News by an Israeli worker still recovering bodies. “I’m a child of Holocaust survivors,” she said, “and I grew up hearing stories of the camps. I thought those were the worst stories. These stories are worse.”

A question that persisted for days was: What did Hamas hope to achieve with what obviously would be seen as a coldly conceived plan to commit unspeakable atrocities—other than the killing of Jews?

The answer has emerged in the days since Oct. 7. It was in great part about the messaging.

“Messaging” has become an everyday word normally associated with branding campaigns. Messaging is an enormous industry whose purpose is to shape public opinion. Ultimately messaging is a euphemism for propaganda, a practice often correctly associated with the Nazis’ Joseph Goebbels, the Reich’s minister of propaganda. Goebbels’s job was to manipulate the media of the time, newspapers and film, to portray Nazism favorably.

It is clear now that a primary Hamas goal was to elicit an overwhelming Israeli military response directed at Gaza itself, with Gazan civilian deaths expected. Hamas knew that an Israeli reaction to the atrocities, such as its current bombing of Hamas sites inside Gaza, would in time produce a counterreaction in Europe and the U.S. That is starting to happen.

A pivotal messaging event was the Oct. 17 “bombing” of al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza. It has since been established, including in a video analysis by this newspaper, that Israel didn’t bomb the hospital. Note, though, how quickly the blame-Israel assumption fell into place among major news outlets. It mattered that Israel’s role in this bombing was disproved. But what mattered to Hamas—via the incredible Palestine Ministry of Health—was establishing that initial assumption. Israel was already being pushed off the moral high ground.

At this point, events quickly arrived at a familiar juncture. The media and some world governments were beginning to “balance” the story. In the past 20 years or so, the U.S. press has adopted the belief that it is obligated to give equal space to groups or movements asserting claims of injustice. Everyone in the political messaging business understands how justice claims drive coverage. Hamas’s massacres, while still being reported, are now being balanced—meaning diluted—by the constant narrative of concern for the Palestinians. However sincere that concern, Hamas and Tehran couldn’t care less.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin surely saw this inevitable balancing of blame coming when he said while in Israel just after the massacres that this was no time for “false equivalence.” It remains to be seen if the Biden administration, especially the White House, can hold the line against false equivalence.

Hamas’s release this week of several of its some 200 hostages appears to be primarily another messaging exercise. Hopes raised, Hamas will negotiate for weeks as the wind ebbs behind Israel’s world-opinion sails.

U.N. Secretary-General Guterres gave a speech Tuesday condemning both Hamas and Israel and called for “an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller rightly said a cease-fire “would give Hamas the ability to rest, to refit, and to get ready to continue launching terrorist attacks against Israel.” But a weather vane like Mr. Guterres shows which way the wind is blowing. It is up to President Biden to resist the inevitable conventional wisdom that both Hamas and Israel bear responsibility for any deaths that occur now. From there we move to the familiar modern policy goal known as “stop the killing.” When that moment arrives, Hamas wins.

Also let off the hook will be the American left—the Squad and the students and professors whose reflex in the face of the bloodletting was to defend or justify Hamas. That fell outside even the elastic norms of “balancing,” so they’ve since evolved into a more generic pose of concern for Gaza’s civilians. And a pose it is. Whether protesting for Palestinians or any other aggrieved group, the left sustains the conceit that their empathy carries greater moral authenticity than that of their opposition. One thing we learned from Israel’s killing fields is what a fraud that is.

How the Saudis Can Help,2023-10-25T20:57:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Michael Segal'],"Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman talks to the media in New Delhi, India, Sept. 11. Photo: harish tyagi/Shutterstock

The core claim that Hamas and its sympathizers have used to justify attacks on Israel is that the Jews are colonialists anywhere they live in Israel, including the communities near Gaza that terrorists attacked this month. That, however, isn’t the only view in the Arab world. A more congenial position was stated in the lead-up to the Abraham Accords, when Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa , Bahrain’s then foreign minister, said that “Israel is part of the heritage of this whole region, historically,” and “the Jewish people have a place amongst us.”

There is ample evidence that view is correct. Jews are indigenous to Israel, as shown by evidence from history, archaeology, linguistics and genetics. Jews are closely related genetically to the Palestinian Arabs, many of whom descend from Jews who converted to Islam, and also to the Saudis. Those of us who work with genetic diseases see evidence of this kinship all the time."
Behind Hamas’s Piecemeal Hostage Strategy,2023-10-25T13:16:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Jared Malsin', 'Summer Said']","JERUSALEM—By setting free four hostages in pairs in recent days, Hamas is playing its most effective card for delaying an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza and extracting concessions from the Israelis, officials and analysts said, as international pressure grows on Israel to negotiate the release of all the captives.

The militant group on Wednesday told mediators it was willing to release a larger group of the more than 200 people held in Gaza, but doubled down on its demand for a steady flow of humanitarian aid, including fuel, and for Israel to reduce the intensity of its airstrikes, officials familiar with the talks said.

“It’s posturing and it’s to keep the negotiations alive,” said Tariq Kenney-Shawa, a U.S. policy fellow at al-Shabaka, a Palestinian policy institute based in California. “What these piecemeal hostage releases do is that it buys time for Hamas and it chips away at this initial international support that Israel was enjoying.”

By delaying Israel’s expected ground assault, even by a few more weeks, Hamas would be able to better prepare to defend itself in Gaza, ensuring the group’s survival in the short term.

Israel cut off all supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity to the Gaza Strip in response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist group, that killed 1,400 Israelis. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in the Palestinian enclave have killed more than 6,500 people, according to the Hamas-led local health ministry. The rising death toll of Palestinian civilians in the enclave also erodes some of the international support for the Israeli offensive, according to Kenney-Shawa.

Israel allowed the deliveries of humanitarian aid to Gaza on Saturday, a day after the first two hostages were released by Hamas. But it has opposed shipments of fuel to Gaza out of concerns that Hamas would use it for military purposes.

U.S. and European officials in recent days have urged Israel to delay a ground operation to allow more time for the hostage negotiations to play out. Within Israel, the families of the hostages are pushing the government to strike an agreement with Hamas before a land assault that could put their safety at risk.

Amid growing pressure to secure the release of the hostages, the Israeli military called on Gaza residents to help it find them, promising money, protection and confidentiality to anybody who provides useful information, according to an English translation provided by the Israel Defense Forces of the message it distributed in Gaza.

It remains unclear how Hamas chose the four hostages it has released so far. The first two were Americans and the second pair were elderly Israeli women.

Experts say Hamas could free some civilian hostages in return for concessions like humanitarian aid while holding on to Israeli soldiers with the aim of eventually freeing a large number of Palestinian prisoners in an exchange with Israel.

“Eventually it is the soldiers, male and female, who are the core of the trade in those terms. So they have buffers. They have degrees of freedom of maneuver and they can draw time,” said Tamir Hayman, a reserve brigadier general in the Israeli military.

“They’re dripping them drop by drop to prolong the suffering of those families and Israeli society and to gain one more achievement to their campaign,” said Gen. Hayman, who is also the managing director of the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli policy institute.

Within Israel, the release of the four hostages has brought the painful human drama surrounding the hostage crisis to the fore. The families of the hostages have been urging Israel to negotiate a deal, saying they fear that their relatives could be hurt in the continuing bombing of Gaza.

“I think Hamas, they’re playing a psychological game with us,” said Hadas Kalderon, a 56-year-old from a kibbutz near Gaza, whose two children—a boy age 12 and a girl age 16—and ex-husband were kidnapped.

“I’m very afraid of any military action. I’m afraid for my children. They’re still there in the middle of a war. I’m terrified. Every day they don’t find a solution and don’t talk about a solution, it’s like sacrificing our children.”

Senior Hamas officials have told Arab negotiators that the group doesn’t intend to hold civilian hostages for months. Soldiers held as prisoners of war, however, would only be released in return for the release of the 6,000 Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails, they said.

A senior Hamas official involved in the negotiations told The Wall Street Journal that the militant group has already downgraded their demands and are no longer demanding exchanging foreign women and children for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons. Instead, the group asked for fuel and aid for Gazans.

The Hamas official said the United Nations would ensure any fuel is directed to hospitals and for civilian use. The U.N.’s agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza said on Tuesday that without fuel it could be forced to completely shut down operations in Gaza, including its shelters for some 600,000 people displaced from the war. U.N. officials also say the fuel could be delivered directly to the U.N. in Gaza without Hamas’ interference.

To be sure, Hamas likely also wants to rid itself of some of the large group of hostages that are a drain on its fast-depleting resources as the fighting drags out, according to analysts and officials familiar with the negotiations. The militant group didn’t expect to capture such a large group of people, especially civilians in the Oct. 7 raid, according to Hamas and Middle East officials negotiating over the release of the hostages.

“My sense is Hamas—the political and military leadership—want to get rid of the civilian hostages as soon as possible,” said Gershon Baskin, an Israeli negotiator who helped organize a deal between Hamas and Israel that freed an Israeli soldier and more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.

“I just imagine that it’s a huge burden on their logistics when their main objective is to confront the Israelis once the army enters Gaza,” Baskin said.

The release of four hostages in recent days has piled more pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing criticism within Israel for the security and intelligence failures that preceded the attack and is now under pressure to strike a deal that would free the hostages.

“There have been many ups and downs in the last weeks over the release of civilians held by Hamas. Every time we thought there was a breakthrough, one side, mostly Israel, backs down at the last minute,” said a senior Egyptian official.

Israel has said that its military operation in Gaza is aimed at removing Hamas from power, but hasn’t said who will take control of the enclave if that goal is achieved.

“They’ve never tried to overthrow Hamas and they’ve never had so many hostages. So I think they’re scrambling to figure out what to do and I think they’re in a serious dilemma,” said Mairav Zonszein, a senior Israel-Palestine analyst with International Crisis Group.

“There’s a small window in which it needs to happen, otherwise it becomes less and less likely to bring them back. There’s already a lot of pressure.”

The release of the two Israeli women, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and Nurit Cooper, 79, on Monday, also pointed to the complexities of the hostage negotiations, in which both Egypt and Qatar have been speaking to Hamas leaders.

Unlike the release of the two Americans last week, which was brokered by Qatar, the release of the Israelis was organized by Hamas and Egypt’s intelligence service, which is in contact with the group’s military wing in Gaza. Qatar, Turkey and other countries are primarily in contact with Hamas’ political leaders, some of whom live in exile in Doha.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
"Gaza Aid Efforts Near Collapse, Hospitals Close as Israeli Airstrikes Intensify",2023-10-24T11:32:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Omar Abdel-Baqui', 'Margherita Stancati', 'Noemie Bisserbe']","The largest provider of humanitarian support in the Gaza Strip said it would be forced to cease operations in the enclave by Wednesday night if it doesn’t receive fuel, putting desperately needed aid for the strip at risk amid intensifying Israeli airstrikes.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency said that without the additional fuel it would be unable to pick up and distribute any incoming aid that enters Gaza, affecting residents across the enclave, including the 600,000 people sheltering at its facilities.

The warning comes amid growing international pressure for Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza ahead of a possible ground invasion in response to the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 in which the group killed 1,400 people and kidnapped at least 222, according to Israeli authorities.

Israeli officials asserted on Tuesday that there are large amounts of fuel under Hamas’s control in Gaza, and that additional fuel could be taken by the group’s military wing rather than being used for trucks carrying aid and to generate electricity at hospitals.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday became the latest Western leader to travel to Israel to show his support, and, like others, sounded a note of caution about how the country goes about achieving its war objectives. “This fight must be without mercy, but not without rules,” Macron said.

At the United Nations, tensions escalated during a Security Council meeting after U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres decried what he called “clear violations of international humanitarian law” in Gaza. The comments drew a rebuke from Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who asked the secretary-general: “In what world do you live?”

Israel placed Gaza under siege after the Hamas attacks, allowing in only 4% of the volume of goods that used to reach the strip before the war, according to the U.N. No fuel, needed for electricity, which Israel also cut, has reached Gaza.

The Israeli military continued to pound the enclave with airstrikes, with at least 400 targets struck over the past day, the military said Tuesday. It also said that it had beaten back an incursion by Hamas militants by sea into Israeli territory just north of Gaza.

Around 1.4 million people, more than half of the strip’s population, are displaced internally. Israel has repeatedly urged civilians to flee northern Gaza—the focus of Israel’s military operations—and to move south.

More than 5,700 Palestinians, many of them children, have been killed in Gaza since the fighting began, according to the Hamas-led Health Ministry. On Tuesday, the Health Ministry said 704 people were killed in recent hours, marking the highest number of casualties in a day since the war began. The numbers couldn’t be independently verified.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said six hospitals in Gaza have shut down because they lack fuel, in addition to those that have closed because of damage or attacks. Several other hospitals have ceased critical services because of the fuel shortage.

“For the people in the Gaza Strip, the situation is desperate,” the WHO said in a statement. “It will become catastrophic without the safe and continuous passage of fuel and health supplies.”

The enclave is short of drinking water, medicine and other vital supplies. Convoys of limited humanitarian aid—carrying food, medicine and water—have reached Gaza from Egypt for three consecutive days since Saturday, after the release of the first two hostages.

Macron, during his visit Tuesday, said France would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Israel, suggesting after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that an international coalition be formed to help counter Hamas, similar to the one that gathered to fight Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. He also cautioned that any Israeli campaign in Gaza should focus on minimizing the extent of any civilian casualties.

French officials later said assembling any international coalition would depend in part on whether Israel can clarify the goals of any ground operation. France still needs to discuss this with Israel and its allies, French officials said, adding it remains a “developing conversation.”

The international coalition could share intelligence and enforce sanctions without threatening local populations, Macron said after meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas later Tuesday. “It will take several weeks to organize but this would make it possible to avoid massive operations, which would threaten civilian populations,” Macron added.

Macron’s visit is the latest in a string of high-profile visits to Israel by U.S. and European government officials in recent days. President Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other figures have all rallied in support of Israel since the war started, saying the country has the right to defend itself, but they have also urged the Israeli government to do more to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and reduce the risk of a broader conflict.

Biden spoke on Tuesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and the leaders agreed to pursue diplomacy and prevent the conflict from expanding, according to the White House. They agreed that more humanitarian assistance was needed and called for the release of hostages. The Crown Prince pushed for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip during the call, according to an official Saudi readout of the conversation.

At the U.N., Guterres reiterated calls for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, adding that while Hamas’s attacks weren’t justified by the grievances of the Palestinian people, they in turn couldn’t justify what he called “the collective punishment” of the Palestinian people.

Russia, which has veto power at the Security Council, said that it didn’t support a U.S.-led draft resolution that condemns Hamas and urges Israel to take all measures necessary to protect civilians, including considering “humanitarian pauses” to allow deliveries of food and aid to Gaza.

Russia’s U.N. ambassador criticized the resolution for falling short of mandating a swift cease-fire and for not preventing Israel from carrying out a ground invasion.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that pauses in fighting to allow aid to flow in should be considered, though the Biden administration has strongly backed Israel’s military campaign.

A full cease-fire “right now really only benefits Hamas,” U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday afternoon.

Netanyahu, meanwhile, blamed Hamas for civilian casualties in Gaza, accusing the group of blending into the resident population to discourage attacks. “But we will do every effort to avoid them and to fight this war as speedily and rapidly as we can, but it could also be a long war,” he said.

The Israeli leader described the conflict as a battle between Iran and its proxies, which he said are fighting to pull the world back to the Middle Ages, and moderates who are pushing for progress and prosperity.

“That is why this battle is not merely our own,” Netanyahu said. “It is Europe’s battle, America’s battle, it is civilization’s battle. It is the battle for the heart and soul of the Middle East and the Arab world.”

Netanyahu also warned the Lebanon-based Hezbollah from joining the conflict, saying the group has embedded itself among the civilian population in Lebanon much as Hamas has done in Gaza.

“If Hezbollah makes the mistake of joining this war in a significant way it will regret it,” he said.

Two rockets fired Tuesday into Israel from Syria raised the specter of a broadening of the conflict. Israel’s military said the rockets landed in open areas and didn’t cause casualties, and that it responded with artillery fire and airstrikes directed at the sources of the launches.

One of the four hostages freed by Hamas, Yocheved Lifshitz, meanwhile recounted her ordeal, describing how she and other captives were brought to a complex network of tunnels in Gaza after they were seized during the Oct. 7 attacks, highlighting the difficulty Israeli forces would likely face in any ground invasion.

Lifshitz described on Tuesday how she was captured by Hamas and outlined the conditions in which she was held for 17 days before her release on Monday.

She said that the militants blew up the gate of her kibbutz, Nir Oz, kidnapped children and the elderly. “There was no difference,” she said, speaking for the first time outside the hospital in Tel Aviv where she is being treated.

She described being brought to Gaza on a motorcycle, her body on one side and head on another. She said the ride put pressure on her ribs, making it difficult to breathe. She also said the militants stole her jewelry and watch, and described how she was brought to a deep, wet underground network of tunnels, which she called a “spiderweb.”

At several points, Lifshitz had difficulty speaking and her daughter had to repeat her words in Hebrew and English.

“We lay on mattresses and doctors came every two to three days,” she said. “The doctor brought medicine. If there wasn’t [the correct] medicine they gave us different medicines.”

The U.S., Egypt and Qatar are involved in negotiations aimed at securing the release of more hostages held by Hamas. President Biden has said the hostages should be released before any cease-fire talks occur.

U.S. officials said on Monday they are recommending that Israel not rush into a ground offensive also because Washington needs more time to get its military assets in place and prepared for use in the event of an expansion of the conflict.

Biden deflected a question Tuesday evening about whether his administration wants Israel to delay the widely anticipated ground invasion into Gaza. “The Israelis are making their own decisions,” Biden said as he greeted Australia’s prime minister at the White House.

Daniel Hagari, Israel’s chief military spokesman, on Tuesday said Israeli ground troops were prepared for an invasion, but that the air force and intelligence services were still engaging in activities that would make a ground operation less challenging.

“We will act when there are the best possible conditions for us. Therefore, via the air force, we will improve the situation on the ground so there will be less threats on our forces,” he said.

In a phone conversation with Netanyahu overnight, Biden said he remains committed “to ongoing efforts to secure the release of all the remaining hostages taken by Hamas—including Americans—and to provide for safe passage for U.S. citizens and other civilians in Gaza,” according to a White House readout of the conversation.

It added that Biden also “underscored the need to sustain a continuous flow of urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza.”

China is also stepping up its diplomatic engagement in the conflict, appealing for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. In separate phone calls to his counterparts in Israel and at the Palestinian Authority, China’s foreign minister called for a resumption of peace talks based on the two-state solution.

Wang Yi appeared to voice disapproval with Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza, telling his Israeli counterpart, Eli Cohen, that while all countries have the right to self-defense, “they should respect the international humanitarian law and protect the safety of civilians.”

In a call with Riyad al-Maliki, the foreign minister for the Palestinian Authority, Wang said, “China expresses deep sympathy over the difficult situation in Palestine, and especially with the people of Gaza.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Your Periodic Reminder That Evil Is Real,2023-10-24T17:49:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Lance Morrow'],"Justice Potter Stewart observed in Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964) that while hard-core pornography is difficult to define, “I know it when I see it.” The same is true of evil.

A decent conscience, uncontaminated by ideology, knows what it is looking at. The torments that Hamas “militants” inflicted on Oct. 7—mass slaughter, rape, the beheading and incineration of babies—amounted to behavior that the high court of any uncorrupted intelligence in the world would describe as evil.

What other word would be sufficient? Wicked? Gruesome? Atrocious? Naughty? No one with any brains uses the word evil lightly. I tend to capitalize it to give the concept (vile, mysterious, theologically absolute) its metaphysical due. President Biden chose his language carefully when he spoke of the Hamas raids as “pure, unadulterated evil.” Since Oct. 7, the word—from which people used to shy away, regarding it as radioactive, over-the-top—has become commonplace and almost unavoidable.

Some years ago I wrote “Evil: An Investigation.” Preparing the book, I would sometimes ask people if they knew anyone they considered to be truly evil. Most would think for a moment, then shake their heads: “Not really. Hitler, of course. But I didn’t know him.” When I asked William F. Buckley Jr., he replied without hesitation, “Gore Vidal.” I laughed. I thought he was kidding, but he wasn’t.

Many people believe evil doesn’t exist. That view is especially common among the rational and enlightened, who insist that events always have a scientific, clinical or political explanation. They are mistaken. Evil is real, with a spooky, inscrutable life of its own.

Evil resides, a law unto itself, in the penetralia of history and human nature. Anyone who doubts its existence should study, in no particular order: the Cambodians’ mass killings under Pol Pot (1975-79), the Japanese Rape of Nanking (1937-38), the Belgians’ atrocities in the Congo (1885-1908) and of course the Holocaust. You might begin your studies in that last topic by reading “Into That Darkness” by Gitta Sereny. It’s about how Franz Stangl, an ordinary Austrian policeman and family man, morphed into the monster who presided over the Nazi death camp at Treblinka.

Evil is a phenomenon at once forbidden and fascinating, full of subtleties, savageries, fever dreams, devilish hallucinations—lies. It may be used to describe a genocide (the Holocaust was evil) or to incite one (Annihilate the evil Jews!). It is the last word of entreaty in the Lord’s Prayer: “Deliver us from evil.” As Hannah Arendt wrote of Adolf Eichmann, evil’s genius for paradox may end by reducing it to a terrifying banality. Or evil may be, as a Cornell professor found the Oct. 7 attack, “exhilarating” and “energizing”—adjectives that also describe getting high on cocaine.

Oct. 7 demonstrated that evil may express itself as the ultimate depravity of politics. How does service to the hope of Palestinian rights, dignity and self-determination get perverted to the evil business of baby-killing?

Politics isn’t a license to kill, rape, burn or decapitate. But it is inevitably an invitation to lesser forms of wickedness, the sort of casual malice that overlords come to savor. Be careful: It’s true that you know evil when you see it, but in the blur of conflict, judgments on the subject of evil are more emotional than precise or theological. Human nature—instinctive, subjective, hyperbolic and profoundly partisan—takes sides.

So it came to pass in recent days that acknowledgment of the patent evil of the Hamas assault on Oct. 7 became shadowed and then, in some minds, reversed by the steps that Israel took—is taking—to defend itself. Is it possible to commit evil in attempting (however brutally) to protect yourself against evil? The question is a sort of Zen koan—with a falsehood at its heart. Call it the solecism of equivalence.

Or are we to adopt a two-tier scale of judgment, in which the primary, initiating act of evil (the assault of Oct. 7, say) is deemed a mortal sin, while secondary acts of self-defense, with whatever collateral damage, are deemed venial? Perhaps. Meantime, it’s a cardinal rule of war and of history’s theatrics that each side in the struggle (especially in the Middle East) must condemn the other as satanic. Evil is an objective fact in the world, and yet it prospers and nourishes itself on the passionate and even tribal subjectivities of human nature.

Much of history is mere anecdote. It may be the obscure but vivid little cruelty that sticks in the mind. A Palestinian friend, old and sick and dying of a blood infection, was being transferred from a West Bank hospital to one in Jerusalem when the ambulance was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint. Time was critical. The border guards—out of boredom, I suppose, or lazy malice—stalled and dithered, searching the ambulance and endlessly rechecking my friend’s identity. The guard manning the checkpoint’s computer did so while reclining languidly in his chair. At one point he pressed the “Enter” key with his toe. That gesture took one at least into the suburbs of evil, did it not? A touch of evil?

My friend made it to the hospital, but, by and by, he died, not necessarily because of what happened at the checkpoint, but partially, I am certain, because of the strain of a lifetime of accumulated rage. These things add up. Rage often does the work of evil, and produces some of the same effects.

How Campus Politicization Fed Today’s Hatred,2023-10-23T21:55:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Danielle Shapiro', 'Yonah Berenson']","Princeton, N.J.

As college campuses erupted in support of Hamas’s atrocities, many administrators responded equivocally. Often they took refuge in the principles of free speech and institutional neutrality, saying universities have no business taking positions on controversial issues. That would have been convincing if they had adhered to those principles before this month, but many didn’t. Officials often took strong positions on far less significant and more debatable issues. This politicization set the stage for the morally and intellectually bankrupt protests that have caused administrators such embarrassment.

Universities are supposed to be places of truth-seeking and open debate. When they enforce dogmas instead, they do a disservice by intimidating students who disagree and by absolving those who agree from the responsibility to defend their views.

In January 2022, the dean of Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs, Amaney Jamal, wrote in a memo to students that Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal set “a dangerous precedent” and that “we . . . know without a doubt” that “there are racial inequities in nearly every strand of the American fabric.” After the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in June 2022, Princeton’s Gender and Sexuality Resource Center announced on its Instagram page that it “actively resists sexism, cissexism, heteronormativity and other intersecting forms of oppression” and that “abortion is an essential and fundamental right that needs to be protected.”

These opinions can be defended, but they weren’t. Princeton administrators instead classified the topics as outside the realm of debate. That discourages students from thinking critically about their own opinions and prejudices and stifles the free exchange of ideas, even on campuses that don’t directly punish speech.

That leaves students intellectually unprepared. If administrators stepped back and encouraged students to debate, students would subject their ideas to the rigor of the intellectual marketplace and be more apt to reject those that failed. Reasonable arguments can be made for or against a two-state solution—but not for mass murder.

Students sometimes seem to have an inkling that they’re defending the indefensible. When Princeton’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine held an outdoor vigil for “Occupied Palestine, Gaza and the West Bank,” it told attendees masks were mandatory. Friends of ours who tried to film the vigil were harassed into putting down their cameras. SJP sent an email to all Princeton students on campus with a statement that listed no individual signers and was linked to an anonymous Google account under the name “River Sea.”

Similarly at Brown, pro-Hamas protesters were told not to “wear identifiable clothing” and that photographs were strictly prohibited. At Arizona State, students were told to “bring signs, flags, water, and please wear a mask.” At Harvard Law School, a statement that held “the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all the unfolding violence” listed 31 student groups as signatories. But as soon as members’ identities were revealed, many groups revoked their support, in part because students feared for their employment prospects. Apparently the desire for lucrative jobs outweighs these activists’ commitment to the Palestinian cause.

As for the administrators, their sudden embrace of free speech and institutional neutrality is craven at best and anti-Semitic at worst. But these principles are crucially important. The campus reaction to Hamas’s atrocities is the most glaring evidence to date that in abandoning them, universities have deprived their students of a good education.

Israel Needs Unconditional Surrender From Hamas,2023-10-23T17:17:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Jerome M. Marcus'],"Israel needs to declare the precise goals of its Gaza campaign—for its own citizens and soldiers, and to establish the credibility of its efforts in the world’s eyes. The “destruction” of Hamas has no meaning in international law and is too vague for Israelis being asked to sacrifice everything.

History provides an example of what Israel should do. At the end of World War II, the Allies’ goal was clear: The German Third Reich must agree to an “unconditional surrender.” The Allies’ demand of Germany should be the model for Israel now. Hamas’s war crimes are equal in depravity to those of the Nazis; their magnitude is far less only because Jews now have a fortified homeland and an Israeli army. Hamas and the Nazis also shared the goal of Jewish genocide. Following the Allies’ example, Israel should announce that it will obtain Hamas’s unconditional surrender.

In 1945, in the presence of representatives of the Allied Powers, German High Command officials signed military surrender documents—the Reims accord in France on May 7 and the Act of Military Surrender in Berlin on May 9. The documents required German soldiers to cease military operations. The Allies’ control of German territory enabled them to enforce that order, which they did.

At the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945, the Allies agreed on a complete disarmament and demilitarization of Germany, the transfer of land from Germany to Poland and the Soviet Union, and the expulsion of German populations from the countries Germany had attacked. The Allies also provided for “de-Nazification”—removing Nazis from positions of authority, eliminating Nazi political organizations, and the arrest and trial of war criminals.

The Allies pursued the removal of Nazis from positions of authority only halfheartedly; but Nazi political parties and organizations were effectively suppressed, and the highest-ranking Nazi leaders were arrested, tried and punished, including by death.

Israel should follow in the Allies’ steps. It must demand unconditional surrender. It must capture and, at least in the war’s immediate aftermath, take complete control of Gaza. It must crush Hamas, killing or capturing its top leaders. Israel must announce that it will try Hamas’s leaders in courts that it convenes for the trial of war crimes—similar to the Jerusalem District Court’s 1961-62 trial of Adolph Eichmann, a Nazi official who played a central role in implementing Hitler’s “Final Solution.” If found guilty, defendants must be executed, and Israel must carry out those sentences. (Israeli law provides for the death penalty in cases involving genocide or Nazi collaboration, and Eichmann is the only prisoner the state of Israel has executed.)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already made it clear that Israel has no desire to govern those who live in the Gaza strip. Just as the Allies worked together to govern Germany immediately after VE Day, Israel can seek partners in the initial government of Gaza. Its Abraham Accords allies—the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco—are the natural source for such help. These Arab states have much to gain from a Gaza that is at peace with its neighbors and free from the sickness Iran seeks to spread throughout the Middle East.

Germany’s surrender enabled French citizens, even those just across the border from the Germans, to live securely and without fear. Israelis in Sderot and other border towns deserve the same. Israel should take a section of Gaza along the border and turn it into a security corridor to ensure the safety of its own citizens. Egypt should do the same on its border with Gaza to end the smuggling of commercial goods and weapons by the Muslim Brotherhood and other illegal groups that could again enable Iran to destabilize the region. Israel and the other Abraham Accords signatories should similarly declare such Islamist organizations out of bounds in a peaceful Gaza.

Israel has a 75-year history of improvising brilliantly as it goes. But clarifying and announcing its plans now for Gaza’s future will promote the legitimacy of Israel’s actions and help it garner support for the steps it must take to secure peace. History teaches us what Israel needs to do.

At a moment when two million people in Gaza, mostly civilians, are poised to become victims of an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, it is shocking that your editorial “The Gaza Hospital and the Missing Aid” (Oct. 18) concludes that humanitarian aid may end up in the hands of Hamas.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East is a principled humanitarian and human development agency providing assistance directly to Palestine refugees. All Unrwa staff, Palestine refugees, contractors, vendors and nonstate donors are screened against the Consolidated U.N. Security Council Sanctions List. Unrwa has, to date, lost 16 of its staff in this tragedy. If only to respect their memory and work in the service of others, Unrwa deserves the opportunity to supply the real facts."
Israel-Hamas War Sows Division Within Entertainment Industry,2023-10-22T16:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Joe Flint', 'Sabrina Siddiqui']","A midshow spat between comedian Dave Chappelle and a fan. Division within the writers’ union after months of solidarity. Private discussions among Hollywood executives and stars about antisemitism.

The entertainment industry is grappling with the same debates over Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks and Israel’s response that are playing out on college campuses, in offices and among friends.

Last week Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger was part of a group of industry executives, actors and writers who gathered at the Bel-Air home of Daniel Loeb, chief executive of the hedge fund Third Point, to discuss antisemitism.

Other attendees included the journalist Bari Weiss, who spoke to the gathering, “Euphoria” creator Sam Levinson, playwright David Mamet and actor Chris Pine, according to people familiar with the event. Loeb also was a sponsor of an antisemitism conference held in Los Angeles last week hosted by the entertainment publication Variety.

Both events were planned before the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, motivated by growing concern about the rise of antisemitism in the U.S.

The conflict has sowed division among movie and television writers who were united for months in demanding new contract protections from studios—and celebrating hard-fought concessions. Several prominent Jewish writers have expressed anger and disappointment at the Writers Guild of America for not issuing a statement condemning the attacks.

On Friday, more than 75 Hollywood writers met over Zoom to further discuss the guild’s approach on the matter and what steps should be taken to show the anger that has been stirred up, people familiar with the meeting said. Among the suggestions: potentially withholding dues until the organization explains its rationale for not making a statement, one meeting participant said.

Members critical of WGA said the union in the past has commented on political and social issues from hate crimes against Asian-Americans to the 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court and President Trump’s 2017 travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

“When terrorists invaded Israel to murder, rape, and kidnap Jews…the Guild stayed silent,” dozens of prominent Hollywood figures, including Jerry Seinfeld and Sacha Baron Cohen, wrote in an open letter published on Medium last week. Other signatories included “Modern Family” co-creator Steven Levitan and Amy Sherman-Palladino, creator of “Gilmore Girls” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”

Meredith Stiehm, president of Writers Guild of America West, emailed some members Saturday saying that the board shares their anguish from recent weeks and that they “wish there had been a simple answer here.”

“Like the membership itself, the Board’s viewpoints are varied, and we found consensus out of reach. For these reasons, we have decided not to comment publicly,” the email, seen by The Wall Street Journal, said. A spokesman for the WGA didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The war and the way elected leaders, chief executives, entertainers and the public respond to it have become societal flashpoints. The fallout has been wide ranging, affecting universities, company morale, job opportunities, union solidarity and even performers’ relationships with fans.

Maha Dakhil, a top agent at Creative Artists Agency, resigned from the agency’s board and stepped back as co-head of its motion pictures unit after posting material on her Instagram account that was critical of Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 attacks.

Comedian Dave Chappelle told the audience at his Boston show last week that he didn’t plan to talk about conflict in the Middle East but partway through the set criticized the Israeli government’s strikes on Gaza.

He said the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel were wrong and added that there was no excuse for cutting off water, electricity, food and medical supplies to innocent civilians. Chappelle was also critical of the financial assistance the U.S. is providing Israel.

At one point, an audience member told him to shut up and Chappelle responded by criticizing the man for trying to silence him at his own show. The comedian told the audience member to shut up, attendees recalled.

Chappelle show attendees said the crowd appeared mostly supportive of his comments, and many shouted “Free Palestine.” A small faction of attendees got up and left the show while a handful shouted, “What about Hamas?” attendees said.

"Hamas’s Gaza Chief, Once a High-Profile Prisoner in Israel, Is Now a ‘Dead Man Walking’",2023-10-21T03:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Rory Jones', 'Summer Said']","During two decades in Israeli prison, Yahya Sinwar learned Hebrew fluently and devoured local newspapers and television. Now, the most senior Hamas leader in Gaza is using that knowledge to fight a war against Israel.

Israel has accused Sinwar, alongside the commander of Hamas’s military wing, Mohammed Deif , of coordinating the brutal Oct. 7 attacks that killed 1,400 Israelis, including 1,000 civilians. Hamas has taken about 200 people to Gaza as hostages.

The Israeli military says it is hunting him down as it targets senior Hamas officials in the Palestinian enclave. Israeli officials believe he is likely hiding in the labyrinth of tunnels used by Hamas militants in Gaza. Last weekend, Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht called Sinwar a “dead man walking.”

“I do believe that Deif committed the plan but the real mind, the brain of this attack was mainly Yahya Sinwar,” said Michael Milshtein, a former intelligence officer for Palestinian affairs in the Israeli army. “He really understands how the Israelis will behave, and how they think, and how they will respond.”

As Hamas leader in Gaza, Sinwar is part of a complex and secretive Hamas leadership structure that includes its military wing and a political arm. In all, there are roughly 15 people at any one time in the senior political leadership, which determines the direction of Hamas via consensus, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.

“I think the tragic events over the last week and Hamas’s brutal use of violence…reflects the dominance of the military movement over Hamas in a way that we haven’t seen before,” said Hugh Lovatt, a fellow at the ECFR.

Ismail Haniyeh, who led the group successfully in elections in 2006 for a legislature that later fell apart, heads Hamas’s council of leaders from Doha and helps manage its relationship with gas-rich Gulf benefactor Qatar.

Another official, Saleh al-Arouri, is the deputy political chief based in Beirut, where he helps oversee Hamas’s relationship with Hezbollah and Iran as well as the group’s operations in the West Bank.

For a time, Western officials considered whether the group was possibly moderating its position on Israel. In 2017, Hamas updated its charter of principles to indicate that it would be willing to recognize the establishment of a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank—territories Israel captured in 1967—rather than the entirety of historic Palestine. Some viewed the move as effective recognition of Israel. Hamas’s original 1988 charter vowed to destroy Israel.

But after the revised charter did little to alter the international community’s hostile view of Hamas—the U.S. has designated the organization a terror group—Sinwar was elected leader in Gaza in 2017. He succeeded Haniyeh, who took over as head of the overall leadership in Doha from Khaled Meshaal, considered a moderate by international observers.

It was a sign of the more militant turn Hamas was taking. Israeli security officials consider Sinwar one of the more hawkish members of Hamas and a bridge between the political leadership and the militant wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, led by Deif.

Deif hasn’t been seen in public for years but issued a statement as the Oct. 7 attacks unfolded, saying his army had launched an operation in response to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands. Sinwar, who has a graying beard and is often pictured scowling, has been silent since the attacks.

Akram Attallah, a Palestinian journalist from Gaza who has met Sinwar several times, said the attack on Israel suggests the group is using more violent methods to build possible leverage for any future negotiations.

Born in the early 1960s in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Sinwar became a student activist and was close to Hamas’s founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a half-blind cleric who was assassinated by Israel in 2004, according to Israeli officials.

When Hamas shifted from being an Islamist movement to an armed group during the Palestinian uprising in the late 1980s, known as the first intifada, Sinwar helped form the forerunner to its military wing, according to Israeli officials. He also established an internal security unit that hunted informants, according to Hamas officials.

In 1988, he was arrested and later convicted of killing Israeli soldiers and given four life sentences.

In prison, Sinwar became one of the most senior incarcerated Hamas officials. He also spent hours talking to Israelis, learning the culture, and “was addicted to Israeli channels,” said a former senior Israeli prison-service official. Many Hamas members have spent time in Israeli jails, so prisoners have long been an influential part of the group’s leadership.

At some point during Sinwar’s incarceration, Israeli doctors saved the Palestinian’s life when he developed a brain illness and was operated on in an Israeli hospital, according to the former prison official and former military officials.

When Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, was kidnapped by Hamas in 2006, Sinwar was considered in negotiations between Israel and Hamas that later led to the release of 1,027 Palestinian prisoners in return for the one Israeli.

According to Gershon Baskin, who worked at the time as an interlocutor between the Israeli intelligence service and Hamas, Sinwar only just made the cut to get out as Israelis had reservations about releasing him. “He was the most senior figure in the prisons who was released,” he said.

After release, Sinwar rose quickly through Hamas ranks.

Hamas members chose Sinwar to lead in Gaza in 2017. Other Hamas leaders assured members that his election as Gaza chief would not drag the group into new rounds of internal and external violence, according to Hamas officials who spoke with The Wall Street Journal.

He developed a reputation as both a hard-liner and a pragmatist, deploying a dual strategy of engaging with Israel, while also turning to violence at times to achieve political leverage. His children, born after he left prison, often attended high-level meetings with him. He told one Hamas official that he spent two decades waiting to have children while in prison, so didn’t want to waste time.

Sinwar also pursued failed talks with the Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority, the group that governs the West Bank, about reconciling with the rival Palestinian faction.

In a rare 2018 interview published in Israeli media, Sinwar told an Italian journalist that war wasn’t in Hamas’s or Israel’s interests. “For sure, it’s not in ours: Who would like to face a nuclear power with slingshots?”

Egyptian officials who dealt with Sinwar said he led a campaign to improve the group’s relationship with Egypt, which had soured after a 2013 coup removed from power in Cairo the Muslim Brotherhood, of which Hamas is an offshoot. President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi then closed off access to the Gaza Strip from Sinai. “He is a real statesman, yet a crude fighter,” an Egyptian official said of Sinwar.

In 2021, Sinwar showed his harder side when Hamas launched rockets at Israeli cities in response to tensions between Palestinians and Jews in Jerusalem, sparking an 11-day conflict.

A Hamas official said Sinwar doesn’t just see himself as a leader inside Hamas, but as someone with a mission to protect Jerusalem and the Al Aqsa mosque there, one of Islam’s holiest shrines.

Like now, Israel said it was seeking to kill Sinwar in 2021 too. After a cease-fire at the time, the Hamas leader walked openly around Gaza in what many Palestinians perceived as a taunt to Israel. Later, at a rally, he was photographed holding the child of a dead Hamas member and an AK-47 rifle.

According to Hamas officials, Sinwar often advocated for a wider battle with Israel where Hamas could dictate new rules of engagement. In a speech in April, he said what he called the Axis of Al Quds—Hezbollah, Iran and Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank—was ready for a fight with Israel.

“We will do our job of defending our Jerusalem, our Aqsa, our West Bank, our people and our women,” he said.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Israel Mourns and Prepares for War,2023-10-20T18:48:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Bernard-Henri Lévy'],"The inside of a home in the kibbutz Kfar Aza under the protection of Israel Defense Forces as there is an alert about two suspects in a neighboring house.

Kfar Aza, Israel

By the time I enter this community adjacent to the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army has removed most of the bodies. I am with a unit of the rescue organization Zaka, whose job is to retrieve parts missing from the bodies of the dead so that they can be made whole and given a proper Jewish burial.

The unit consists of civilians and military personnel, secular and Orthodox Jews. On a coffee break, they sit in a circle on plastic chairs on the patio of a sacked farm that serves as the unit’s headquarters. Some complain about their government’s negligence. One counters that no government can stop the madness of a mob.

The atmosphere of brotherhood contrasts with the recent months of civil struggle. Now, the only thing that counts is the holy task of combing through houses to recover a piece of blackened flesh, an intact foot still in its shoe, a trace of DNA, a bloodstain.

We freeze suddenly when someone finds the body of a jihadist that we fear may be booby-trapped. Then comes a moment of panic because it seems two terrorists might have just entered through a new breach in the security fence nearby, or the old one but now enlarged—no one knows.

We spot a drone in the sky, like a sparrow hawk. Mingling with its wasp-like buzzing are the sounds of dull explosions. A combat unit in assault gear emerges and takes its position. Some soldiers kneel; others climb to the roofs; still others move to the severed security barrier, from which appears a shower of sparks.

I am led into a house with shattered windows. Its inhabitants were murdered, their hands tied behind their backs, shot and in some cases finished off with a knife. I remain for two hours with nothing to do but listen to a surviving neighbor recount the attack. Over and over, he leads me through the rooms of this theater of torture.

The plaster ceilings chipped by shooting. The bullet-riddled walls. The beige sofa that an explosion raised off the ground and sent flying into the broken bay window. The parents’ room, with its unmade bed, hair curlers, worn slippers. The children’s room, with an open coloring book and a battery-powered cat meowing periodically. In the kitchen, an intact bowl of hot chocolate, a toaster, a bottle of cough syrup, a plush toy, an overturned laundry basket. And, at the end of a right-angled hallway, the safe room that the attackers opened by blowing it up with a grenade, leaving nothing but chunks of concrete, bloodied iron reinforcing and empty hinges opening and closing on nothing.

On the wall hangs a charcoal portrait of a 60-ish man with a billowy shirt, sleeveless vest, pipe, and soft hat pushed back from his forehead. I think of a farmer out of Steinbeck or an Israeli pioneer from a novel by A.B. Yehoshua or Amos Oz.

Kfar Aza and the other martyred places in this part of Israel—Sa’ad, Be’eri, Re’im—aren’t mere villages. They are kibbutzim, the distinctive rural communities of early Israel, the living remains of liberal Israel whose inhabitants are often among the most ardent advocates of peace with the Palestinians. This war pits Hamas against the kibbutz, the Islamist Einsatzgruppen against the faithful members of one of the few 20th-century utopias that haven’t broken into pieces.

Modern Israel was established in 1948, the same year I was born. I fly here as soon as I can, as I have done every time the country has gone to war since 1967. My first stops are Ashdod and Ashkelon, coastal cities north of the Gaza Strip, where sirens wail and the few drivers stop short in the middle of the road to tumble into the drainage ditch for shelter.

I take a detour east through Be’er Sheva, where a succession of helicopters, military and civilian, are bringing the wounded to the Soroka Medical Center at an awful pace.

Then I head back to Sderot, which, of all the cities of the south, is the most exposed whenever war breaks out. I realize that I have never seen it except under a hail of missiles.

What might Sderot look like at a time when its children are going to school and are not confined, as they are today, in the basements of buildings on Abargel Road, from which you can hear the whistle of rockets through the thick concrete? What is the face of Sderot when one doesn’t risk stumbling, in the middle of Menachem Begin Road, on the swollen remains of a jihadist felled in the last hours of the assault—his weapon still by his side, his exposed legs blackening, his body not yet covered, as others are further on, by an emergency blanket or a tarp?

And who is Yossi, 83, when he hasn’t spent the night in his basement with his grandchildren listening to the footfalls of the killers hunting for them above? They knew he was there—they called out his name and the names of his grandchildren, whom he silently implored, his finger to his lips, not to answer or to cry. Twice the killers came down and tried to open the latchless door against which Yossi braced himself with every ounce of his strength. What does he look like when he isn’t wearing the fierce, youthful look that his courage has given him?

This morning, Sderot is a dead city. Its streets are a web of deserted Via Dolorosas in which one wonders for whom the intense October sun is shining. The city’s fire chief was shot point-blank while fighting a blaze in a house where a handicapped couple was trapped. I attend his funeral at the firehouse, where sharpshooters, who are supposed to be guarding the entrance, take turns standing at the casket. The chief’s fellow firemen, their chiseled cheekbones contrasting with moist eyes in swollen sockets, unite in silent grief. They all seem to be saying that the Jews haven’t come to wage war but to pray, study, build libraries and sometimes put out fires set by evil men.

The ghost-town atmosphere, the dead shell of the police station that had to be destroyed to flush out the last terrorists—and, in front of its sagging facade, the odd spectacle of Gideon Levy, Haaretz journalist and star of the peace camp, in friendly conversation with a soldier in a kippah—all of it breaks the heart.

No one can predict much about the Israel Defense Forces’ land offensive—whether it will be massive or targeted, long-term or temporary, or even whether it will happen at all.

But in Jerusalem I meet President Isaac Herzog. In principle, he has only symbolic power. But his personal aura, combined with what many Israelis see as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s disgrace, has turned him into a central figure on the national political scene.

Not once did Mr. Herzog mention “revenge.” As we strolled in the statue garden of the presidential residence, where we stopped before the bust of Shimon Peres, this former lawyer, steeped in Jewish culture and humanism, embodied the spirit of moderation and wisdom that I have always found in him. But I sense that he is worried, impatient. He has a three-day beard and, behind the rimless glasses of a man of study and knowledge, an insomniac expression that I have never seen.

He calls the Oct. 7 massacre the “worst tragedy in Israel’s young history” and says Hamas is “neither a resistance group nor a national liberation movement, but rather a twin of the Islamic State.”

The Western world faces a “moment of truth,” he insists with an unfamiliar but well-contained touch of anger in his voice. Does the West understand that it is not possible to refrain from punishing those who “slit children’s throats” at the Tribe of Nova music festival? Will the West join Israel in doing what it takes to ensure that “those who gave the orders for this infamy, whether they are in Gaza, Doha or Tehran, will never be able to do so again”?

In Tel Aviv, on a day of high alert when the Iron Dome was in ceaseless operation, I see former Deputy Prime Minister Benny Gantz, a brigadier general with an impeccable record, a legendary parachutist who in 1991 was responsible for Operation Solomon, which repatriated the Jews of Ethiopia.

On the day we meet, he is still one of the leaders of the opposition. He hasn’t decided whether to accept Mr. Netanyahu’s invitation to participate in a national unity government. He knows that if he does accept the offer, if he lends his political adversary the immense credibility he enjoys within the Israeli army, he will be running a personal political risk.

But this is no longer “about individuals,” he says, his husky voice seeming to strike through his teeth. He swore to himself that if he joined the cabinet he would “leave it again the very second the war was won.” But before that can happen, the war will have to be waged. One must keep in mind, he muses, that there are solemn moments—today is one of them—when Israel, laboring under the twin pressures of external enemies and internal discouragement, faces an existential threat.

He says goodbye, then pauses to relate a series of wrenchingly beautiful anecdotes: A retired general friend hopped into his car, revolver in hand, to save a family trapped in its kibbutz. An officer planning the liberation of another kibbutz was informed that his own son was among the first killed. He took 10 minutes to weep, collected himself and resumed command.

“The Palestinians are not Israel’s enemy,” Mr. Gantz says. “It is Hamas that must be destroyed.” At the edge of the Gaza Strip, IDF units position themselves to do that job. With their mine-clearing bulldozers, their real and decoy tanks, and their ranks of reservists, they are preparing to go into action.

The grinding of the tank treads grows louder. With menacing patience, helicopters whirl overhead in the blue sky. A mass of men and women have come from every nation of the world to stand in a forest of flags fluttering in the breeze of a warm afternoon that seems endless: They are gathering to confront one of the most tragic tests in the history of the state of Israel.

Under the drumbeat of human voices muffled by the freshly tamped earth and sand floats a series of questions to which they don’t always know the answers but that they are determined to face.

Will they succeed in saving both their nation and the hostages, whose number grows from hour to hour and whose cause is sacred here? If they succeed, will they remain faithful to the Jewish morality that leads them to treat captured jihadists as decently as Jewish children, as I witnessed at the emergency care center in Be’er Sheva?

What of the famous code of purity of arms, the Tohar HaNeshek, that was so important to Israel’s pioneers? This creed explains why one finds lawyers embedded with the soldiers of every IDF unit—unarmed men who have the power to question and even suspend any order they deem inconsistent with international law and ethics. How will these imperatives fare in the face of an adversary whose cynicism is boundless, that makes hostages of its own people and doesn’t hesitate to use them as human shields and grist for propaganda?

Will Egypt—self-described ally and sister of the Palestinian people—open its border to the hundreds of thousands of Gazans asked to leave the northern zone to protect themselves from the fighting?

And these young Israeli soldiers, fervent and tormented—will they return alive from the Gaza that lies before them like a dark mass lit up from afar by incoming and outgoing rockets?

Among the soldiers are men and women of the left and of the right; supporters of Mr. Netanyahu as well as opponents who recognize him only reluctantly as their commander in chief; Jews who wear the Tefillin and Jews who do not. I have heard none of them deny that this war is just and must be won.

What Is Hamas? What to Know About the Militant Group Fighting Israel,2023-10-10T12:45:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['James Hookway'],"Hamas upended the stability of the entire Middle East when its militants surged into Israel from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7. Israelis across the political spectrum were shocked by the scale of the assault and the extent of the violence. Some called it Israel’s 9/11 for how some of the world’s best trained and equipped security forces were caught unprepared and powerless to ward off the incursions.

Israeli authorities said at least 1,400 people have been killed since the attacks began and 289 of its soldiers have died. Some 199 civilians and soldiers were abducted from Israel during the assault and are being held in Gaza.

Israeli forces have struck Gaza repeatedly by air ahead of what many anticipate to be a prelude to a full ground invasion of the tiny enclave and amid a growing humanitarian crisis there. Officials in Gaza said some 2,750 Palestinians have been killed.

But what exactly is Hamas, and what are its objectives?

What is Hamas?

Hamas, an Arab acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement, was founded in 1987 after an eruption of protests and riots over Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin’s initial aim was to create an Islamic state on the land now comprising Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, a goal later reaffirmed in the Hamas Charter a year later.

Hamas subsequently signaled it was willing to accept a two-state solution based on Israel’s borders as they were before 1967, but the group continues to reject Israel’s right to exist and opposed the Oslo Accords negotiated by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s. It maintains a powerful military wing in addition to its political and social-welfare arms. The U.S., European Union and Israel deem it to be a terrorist organization.

After Hamas won legislative elections in Gaza in 2006, the following year it forcibly removed officials from the more moderate Fatah group in a week of fighting. More than 100 people were killed in the conflict, which separated the Palestinian territories into Hamas-controlled Gaza and the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.

Why did Hamas attack Israel now?

The Oct. 7 assault saw Hamas fighters entering Israel by land, sea and in some cases by motorized paragliders. It happened the day after the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Yom Kippur War, when the armies of Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack overwhelming the Israeli defenses in the Sinai Peninsula and on the Golan Heights before Israel could strike back, subsequently settling areas of the West Bank.

Hamas said the specific trigger for the assault was an unspecified desecration at the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third-holiest site in Islam.

The timing, however, may have been dictated by Iran. The Wall Street Journal has reported how Tehran sent top military and diplomatic officials to meet with the leadership of both Hamas and Hezbollah, which operates in southern Lebanon, in the weeks and months before Oct. 7, hoping to direct its allies in a coordinated attack on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was facing increasing opposition over his plans to limit the power of the country’s judges, leaving Israel badly divided. More important, perhaps, the attack was aimed at disrupting U.S.-brokered talks to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel that Iran and the Palestinians saw as a threat, senior Hamas and Hezbollah members said.

Who is the leader of Hamas?

There are several key figures in Hamas’s leadership structure. Among them is Mohammed Deif, the group’s military chief. He was prominent in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, describing it as retribution for Israeli treatment of the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Deif has been the target of several assassination attempts. His wife and infant son were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in 2014. In subsequent years, he warned Israel of military action over land disputes in East Jerusalem, where Palestinian residents have faced growing pressure to leave.

The head of Hamas’s political arm since 2017 is Ismail Haniyeh, who spends much of his time in Qatar. Born in a refugee camp in Gaza, he succeeded Khaled Meshaal, the Hamas leader who first broached the idea of accepting the borders laid out before 1967, when Israel expanded its territory in the Six Day War.

Who is Yahya Sinar?

Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s chief in Gaza, is a former militant commander. He was arrested in Israel in 1988, convicted of killing Israeli soldiers and sentenced to four life sentences. He was released as part of a prisoner exchange in 2011. The U.S. State Department added him in 2015 to a list of designated terrorists. Israel considers Sinwar one of the most hawkish of Hamas’s leaders, and his rise reflects the growing influence of the group’s military wing.

Where is Hamas’s headquarters?

LEBANON Mediterranean Sea SYRIA GOLAN HEIGHTS Haifa Nazareth Nablus Tel Aviv West Bank Amman Ramallah Jerusalem israel Dead Sea Gaza Sderot Gaza Strip Be’er Sheva JOrdan EGYPT 20 miles 20 km LEBANON SYRIA Mediterranean Sea GOLAN HEIGHTS Haifa Nazareth West Bank Tel Aviv Amman Ramallah Jerusalem Gaza JOrdan israel Dead Sea Sderot Gaza Strip Be’er Sheva EGYPT 20 miles 20 km

Hamas is largely concentrated in Gaza City but also has operations in the West Bank and an overseas presence among the Palestinian diaspora. Israel has long accused the group of operating in civilian areas to discourage attacks.

What is the history behind the Israel-Gaza conflict?

The enmity between Israel and the Palestinians ultimately can be traced back to the territorial conflicts surrounding the creation of the Israeli state in 1948. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes to seek refuge in areas including the West Bank and Gaza, a coastal strip of land between Israel and Egypt around twice the size of Washington, D.C. Egypt subsequently occupied the area until the Six Day War in 1967 when Israeli forces took control.

Israel agreed to give Palestinians partial autonomy in part of the territory after the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accords. It withdrew its remaining settlers and soldiers from the strip in 2005, instead adopting a policy that effectively sealed off Gaza from much of the rest of the world. Egypt also moved to pen in many of Gaza’s two million people.

When Hamas secured control of Gaza in 2007, tensions with Israel steadily escalated, with Israeli forces launching military operations in the enclave in the winter of 2008-09 and again in 2011.

Then, in 2014, Hamas-affiliated militants kidnapped and killed three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank. The incident led to Israeli raids in the territory and some 350 arrests. Hamas responded by firing a barrage of rockets into Israel from Gaza, sparking a seven-week-long conflict in the territory and the deaths of more than 2,000 Palestinians. In addition, 67 Israeli soldiers, five Israeli civilians and a Thai citizen were killed. The conflict was notable for the way Hamas demonstrated a greater capability to fire deep into Israel, with rockets now reaching Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Since then, Israel largely tried to follow a policy of containing Hamas, though violence was ever-present in the background. In 2021, after weeks of confrontation in Jerusalem between Israelis and Palestinians over access to some of the city’s religious sites, Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of rockets into Israel, killing 14 civilians and one soldier. Israeli counterstrikes killed more than 250 in Gaza before Egypt helped broker a cease-fire. With Israeli forces now massing on the border with Gaza and Netanyahu vowing retribution, the containment policy could be at an end.

Who funds Hamas?

U.S. officials have said Iran has provided significant financial and weapons support for Hamas. In 2019, for example, the U.S. Treasury said the militants’ military wing, known as the Al-Qassam Brigades, had received more than $200 million from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in the previous four years.

Israeli defense officials said Iran has also helped provide technical expertise for Hamas to develop its own rockets and missiles and evade Israeli blockades. Some are now capable of reaching Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Hamas also is increasingly using cheap drones to hit Israeli targets.

But Tehran isn’t alone in providing funds for Hamas. The Al-Qassam Brigades have meanwhile benefited from a wave of cryptocurrency donations, particularly after the 2021 conflict. In the year leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, three militant groups—Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and their Lebanese ally Hezbollah—received large amounts of funds through crypto, according to a review of Israeli government seizure orders and blockchain analytics reports.

Digital-currency wallets that Israeli authorities linked to the PIJ received as much as $93 million in crypto between August 2021 and June this year, analysis by leading crypto researcher Elliptic showed. Wallets connected to Hamas received about $41 million over a similar time period, according to research by another crypto analytics and software firm, Tel Aviv-based BitOK.

Some countries have provided relief aid and other funding for civilian purposes. Qatar has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank to fund reconstruction and government expenses after Israeli bombardments.

The White House, meanwhile, has dismissed suggestions from Republican opponents that Iran is now able to provide more support to Hamas after the U.S. unfroze a $6 billion tranche in Iranian funds as part of a prisoner swap agreement. U.S. officials say the money can only be used for specific humanitarian purposes. Nikki Haley, among others, has said it still frees up money elsewhere in the Iranian budget that could be directed to Hamas.

What’s the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah?

Hamas is a Sunni group, a branch of Islam followed by the majority of the Muslim world. Hezbollah, like Iran, is Shia and as a consequence has longer-running ties to the Islamic Republic. It was formed in the aftermath of the 1982 Lebanon war as an umbrella group for disparate Shia groups in the country and was trained in part by forces from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. In the 1990s, Hezbollah took on a more formal political role in Lebanon and is today a prominent faction in the ruling alliance.

Hezbollah and Hamas have a shared antipathy toward Israel and aim to eradicate the Israeli state. Hezbollah leaders said they stood in solidarity with Hamas leaders after the Oct. 7 attacks and there has been sporadic fighting with Israeli troops along the Israel-Lebanon border since the Hamas assault.

But Hezbollah, which, like Hamas, is designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. and other countries, also serves Iran’s broader objectives in the Middle East by opposing any Western or Israeli presence.

A U.S. aircraft carrier strike force arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean on Tuesday, a deployment a defense official described as “a deterrent signal to Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, and any other proxy across the region” who were weighing joining the conflict.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
"In China’s Calls for Mideast Peace, Hamas Assault Goes Unmentioned",2023-10-16T03:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['James T. Areddy'],"Chinese leader Xi Jinping hosted the president of the Palestinian authority, Mahmoud Abbas, on a state visit in June that established a strategic partnership.

Since the start of the recent turmoil in the Middle East, one word has been absent from China’s official statements: “Hamas.”

China has called for peace and de-escalation in the region but has avoided any condemnation of the deadly assault on Israel by the Gaza-based militant group, which shocked the world on Oct. 7. China’s tiptoeing around the brutality echoes its avoidance of terms such as “invasion” to describe Russia’s military assault on Ukraine and highlights both Beijing’s longstanding Palestinian leanings and its efforts to challenge Western geopolitical narratives.

The U.S. and its allies immediately condemned the assault as evil terrorism by Hamas. Beijing, by contrast, has blamed historic factors and expressed generalized concern “over the current escalation of tensions and violence between Palestine and Israel.”

Rather than scenes of carnage in Israel, China’s government-run media have spotlighted the Israeli military’s forceful response in Gaza, set against a backdrop of deepening hardships for Palestinians, often aired alongside video and photos of U.S. warships as if to suggest the reaction is American-led.

​As in Ukraine, China is trying to avoid antagonizing either side, while standing apart from U.S. policy, political analysts said.

“Historically, China has aligned with the Arab League on supporting the Palestinians. In comparison, Israel is always an ally of the U.S.,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping has yet to comment publicly on the crisis.

His Mideast envoy has spoken with both Palestinian and Israeli authorities, as well as other players in the region. “Special Envoy Zhai Jun stressed during the phone calls that to end the cycle of conflict between Palestine and Israel, the key is to return to the two-state solution as the basis, restore peace talks, establish an independent State of Palestine, and realize the peaceful coexistence of Palestine and Israel,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters on Friday.

Beijing slightly toughened its initial statement on the unfolding crisis after pointed complaints from Israeli officials and visiting Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that it failed to condemn terrorism. The adjusted statement stopped short of criticizing the attack and didn’t mention Hamas.

China has sought to portray itself as a neutral party and peacemaker in hot spots such as the Middle East, and some analysts see its muted sympathy for Israel as calibrated to avoid stirring the Arab world. That is partly a mathematical play: There are nearly two dozen Arab League nations versus one Israel, equaling more votes in the United Nations and bigger market opportunities, including for Xi’s Belt and Road investments and other development and security initiatives. Plus, the Arab world supplies China with oil.

Beijing has warmed to Israel in recent years by celebrating its technology sector. But for far longer China has aligned itself with Palestinian causes including its unmet demands for a self-ruled state, which Chinese statements identify as the root cause of the latest outbreak in hostilities.

Xi hosted the president of the Palestinian authority, Mahmoud Abbas, on a state visit in June that established a strategic partnership, a term China usually reserves for countries it views as sharing common interests in global affairs. Before the recent attack, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had also been expected to travel as soon as this month to meet Xi in Beijing.

China’s tone has fallen flat in Western capitals. “They are doing the same thing they did with Ukraine,” said Elizabeth Wishnick, senior research scientist at Arlington, Va.-based Center for Naval Analyses. She said that such stands contrast with Beijing’s pledges to play a constructive force in global affairs.

China’s dispassionate response to what Israelis are comparing to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S. is also a reminder of how government broadcaster China Central Television waited hours to show the first images of the terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists that destroyed New York’s World Trade Center and then only as a brief bulletin at the end of a regular news program. Still, unlike Xi’s silence at the attack on Israel, then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin did send U.S. President George W. Bush a telegram expressing China’s “deep sympathy and condolences” to the families of victims and stressing the Chinese government’s condemnation of terrorism.

The latest messaging reflects deep-seated Beijing policy, rather than a tin ear, analysts said. Its expression of deep concern on Saturday matched virtually word for word a Foreign Ministry statement following a smaller outbreak in Palestinian-Israeli hostilities in April, and aligned with statements from some Arab capitals.

Dispatches by China’s government-controlled media have mentioned Hamas, often in stories produced in the Middle East and typically with the group’s more formal names, including “Islamic Resistance Movement” and “Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement.” But they haven’t linked the group to deaths in Israel or explored its ties to Iran, instead equivocating with action-reaction explanations: “The Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) on Saturday launched a surprise attack on southern Israeli towns adjacent to the Gaza Strip, prompting Israel to launch retaliatory strikes on Gaza,” Xinhua News Agency has said in English-language dispatches.

Noam Urbach, a China scholar in Israel, said China is proud of how during the Holocaust it granted entry to thousands of European Jews but has now shown a “great betrayal” by refusing to criticize Hamas and censoring domestic media coverage of its slaughter.

More sympathy with Israel has appeared in messages on the country’s busy social media, possibly reflecting increasing Chinese tourism to Israel. “Any language or behavior to support Hamas is extremely shameful. They are taking children, women and elderly hostage,” one user commented on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform.

To China watchers, Beijing’s halting responses to Russia’s Ukraine invasion appeared to undermine its often-repeated defense of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Likewise, Beijing’s relative silence on the slaughter of Israeli families by Hamas militants, coupled with signs of concern about Israel’s response, contrast with Chinese retorts to Western criticism about the detention of numerous Muslim Uyghur people in Xinjiang: that aggressive action is necessary to eliminate terrorism.

“Counterterrorism for me, but not for thee,” said Jordan Schneider, who has tracked Beijing’s messaging for his New York-based outlet, ChinaTalk Media.

Schneider said that China’s avoidance of commentary that might be sympathetic to Israel could pay short-term dividends in the Arab world but won’t help Xi’s aims to build international credibility. “If you want to be a globally respected superpower, you’ve got to be human,” he said.

Beijing’s messaging so far in the Israeli crisis is also seen as complicating Xi’s effort to position China as a global peacemaker, including in Ukraine, following his government’s success this year in nudging Saudi Arabia and Iran to curb their mutual animosities.

“Despite the growing interest in the region, Beijing’s silence on the Hamas attack could yet limit its ability to broker peace there,” Claus Soong, an analyst at Berlin-based think tank Mercator Institute for China Studies, said in a commentary.

U.S. ambassador to China Nicholas Burns, during a Wednesday presentation to a National Committee on U.S.-China Relations audience, called Beijing’s initial statement on the attacks “very neutral and very flat” and without an expression of sympathy for the loss of life.

“It remains to be seen if China has the ability to be a true mediator, where you have to speak the truth to both sides,” he said.

Violence Surges in the West Bank Following Hamas Attack on Israelis,2023-10-16T03:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Sune Engel Rasmussen', 'Fatima Abdulkarim']","Palestinian casualties in Gaza triggered protests across the West Bank, including in Nablus, where tires were burned on Friday.

RAMALLAH, West Bank—Israel’s devastating bombing campaign on Gaza after last week’s Hamas attack has fueled deadly violence in the West Bank, where concerns are rising that the territory could erupt into another front in the war.

In the wake of the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians, in southern Israel, Jewish settlers have attacked Palestinians and security forces have clashed with protesters, as Israel tightens its grip on the area to prevent further attacks.

At least 56 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to Palestinian health authorities. The United Nations said the past week has been the deadliest for West Bank Palestinians since at least 2005. More than 1,100 have been injured in the West Bank.

Since the attack by Hamas, a group that is designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization, Israel says it has dropped about 6,000 bombs targeting the group in the Gaza Strip and is preparing for an invasion of the enclave. That could fuel further confrontations in the West Bank and push the territories closer to an all-out confrontation with Israel.

More than 2,300 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over the past week, about half of them women and children. The casualties have triggered protests across the West Bank, including in Ramallah and the towns of Jenin and Nablus.

“The grief and anger is palpable,” said Yara Hawari, Ramallah-based senior analyst of the think tank Al-Shabaka: the Palestinian Policy Network. “Gaza and the West Bank are not separate entities. They are divided, but culturally and socially they belong very much together.”

The current hostilities come after a prolonged Israeli military operation in the West Bank, in response to a series of attacks inside Israel, including in Tel Aviv, earlier this year. A total of 35 Israelis, including 26 civilians, were killed this year as of August, according to Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service. Despite international efforts to ease tensions, violence had continued to escalate leading up to the Hamas attack from Gaza.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government has included ultranationalist parties that have pushed for expanding Jewish sovereignty in the West Bank. Settlers have in turn characterized clashes with Palestinians as self-defense.

The first two months of this year were the deadliest start to any year in the West Bank in over two decades, as a result of Israeli military raids deep in Palestinian-administered territory in what Israeli officials say was a response to terrorism.

Moreover, Palestinian militant groups in the West Bank have stockpiled caches of illegal weapons, some from Iraq and Syria, that have helped destabilize the territory. The increase in weapons smuggling also reflects the weakening of the Palestinian Authority’s grip on security over the territory, as new militant groups jockeyed for power in recent months.

“I’m very concerned about what’s happening in the West Bank,” said Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University’s Moshe Dayan Center, but added that another intifada, or uprising, wasn’t “inevitable.”

“The question is whether the Palestinian people in the West Bank will be deterred by the dramatic visions they will see in Gaza, or whether they will demonstrate their solidarity,” said Milshtein, who is also former head of Palestinian affairs in the military intelligence of the Israel Defense Forces.

For two years across the West Bank, Palestinians have experienced a surge in armed settlers attacking their homes and destroying property, according to the United Nations.

Sixteen Palestinians were killed on Friday across the West Bank. Earlier in the week, three Palestinian men were killed in a settler attack in the village of Qusra near Nablus, according to Palestinian authorities. The day after, settlers attacked the funeral, killing another two men.

The IDF didn’t reply to requests for comment.

In a video shared by the Israeli human-rights organization B’Tselem, a man who the group said was an Israeli settler, accompanied by an Israeli soldier, is seen entering the West Bank village of Tuwani near Hebron and shooting an unarmed man in the stomach from close range. Storyful, which is owned by The Wall Street Journal’s parent company, News Corp, confirmed the location of the incident in the video and corroborated the date. The Israeli military didn’t reply to a request for comment.

Since the Hamas attack, the Israeli military says it has arrested 330 people in raids across the West Bank, including 190 alleged operatives of Hamas, which is present but not dominant in the territories. The IDF says it has thwarted more than 10 terrorist attacks in the West Bank since the start of the war.

Israeli forces have closed crossings into the West Bank and used checkpoints and roadblocks to cut the northern and southern parts of the territory off from each other. Access has also been blocked to sites that have been flashpoints in past protests, such as the town of Huwara, where only Israelis now have access to the road. Wajih Odeh, a resident of Huwara, said shops there had been closed for a week and residents needed permission even to take the garbage out.

In the Bedouin community of Wadi al-Siq east of Ramallah, settlers drove all the residents out with force, attacking them as they left, said Abdallah Abu Rahmeh of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who said settlers attacked the community late Wednesday. The attackers looted a home, broke solar panels and threatened to set the encampment on fire, Abu Rahmeh said.

“Under the cover of what’s happening in Gaza, settlers and soldiers feel emboldened to commit violations of Palestinian rights in the West Bank,” the think tank’s Hawari said. “The atmosphere that the Israeli government is creating is encouraging settlers to take matters into their own hands.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
An Israeli Painter’s Broad-Minded Brush,2023-10-15T20:45:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Daphne Merkin'],"Ever since Hamas’s barbaric invasion of Israel on Oct. 7—a Shabbat morning that also happened to herald the end of the Jewish holiday of Succoth and fell one day after the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the 1973 Yom Kippur War (the symbolism runneth over)—I have been thinking of Tal Mazliach . A gifted artist and magical woman, she lives in a two-room house in Kfar Aza, one of the southern kibbutzim close to Gaza that were attacked.

As I watch the news, flinching at yet another report of bodies mutilated, babies murdered, soldiers shot asleep in their underwear, or helpless grandmothers taken hostage, it occurs to me that it is difficult, however much we try, to think of that many people’s deaths at once, especially those who were stabbed, shot, or, most horrifically, decapitated. How to imagine body after body, face after face, consciousness after consciousness, all come to an abrupt and violent end? The tragedy isn’t lost on one so much as slightly blurred, like a gruesome video image that fails to come into precise view, perhaps because of the camera’s jerky movements or perhaps because of the carnival atmosphere, interrupted by shouts of “Allahu Akbar!” and yelps of joy.

Among its first moves, Hamas ravaged Kfar Aza, gunning down many of the inhabitants and taking hostages. That’s why I find myself thinking of Tal, who was born in Kfar Aza and once called it a “paradise” in an interview with Haaretz. I visited Tal, whose last name means leader or someone successful, there in February 2022 together with my sister, who has lived in Jerusalem since 1983 with an ever-growing family of four children and 12 grandchildren.

I discovered the artist’s work, which is in many collections in Israel, at the Alon Segev gallery in Tel Aviv. I have often thought Israeli artists are overlooked internationally, in part because Israel is frequently treated like a canceled entity whose art is suspect, and I always go gallery-hopping when in the country. Tal’s paintings, with their bold colors and childlike hieroglyphic-style markings, immediately captivated me. They reminded me of the paintings and drawings of Outsider Artists like Henry Darger and Jimmy Lee Sudduth, who are untrained and work outside the usual artistic conventions. She filled the canvas to its edges in a way that was reminiscent of the Outsiders’ horror vacui (fear of empty spaces) and included much repetition of images. Her figures, including dolls, other toys and body parts, were sprinkled with black dots, like a graphic form of measles, which I later learned represented Tal’s own rare skin disease, nevus, and were a tribute to the idea of human differences. She also frequently uses the colors of the Palestinian flag—green, white and red—in her paintings. One of Tal’s main concerns is Otherness, psychological and physical, and how to de-Other the perceived enemy, whether Arab or Israeli.

The kibbutz was charming, sparkling in the sun with street signs off small lanes. I’d been told the painter was reclusive and ill at ease with strangers, but in the event she was a gracious hostess, offering us grapes and hummus. She chatted merrily (my sister speaks Hebrew fluently and I speak fairly good Jewish day-school Hebrew) about her creative process and the group of children she had befriended who regularly visited, which included her nieces and nephews. (Tal is single but has family in the kibbutz.) The walls of her home were covered with her singular and whimsical work, like a map of a country of her own making, including unfinished pieces and bits of drawings that signified the start of a new idea.

Before we reached Tal’s house the two friends who were driving my sister and me stopped at the barbed-wire fence that separated Kfar Aza from Gaza, which lay some yards in the distance. I got out, walked up to the fence, and felt a flicker of fear on behalf of the kibbutzniks. Were they tempting fate, parading their seemingly good life a stone’s throw from a beleaguered, disempowered neighbor? l was told that there had been a few skirmishes but that the members of the kibbutz felt relatively secure. l wondered at the trust it took for this small group to build a foundation so near a crowded strip of land governed by their sworn enemies, Hamas, whose very charter demanded the death of the Zionist state.

Last week a former Hamas leader invoked jihad and called for a global day of rage in memory of the dead in Gaza. A sense of apprehension, not felt since the Holocaust, is building in Jews across the world. Jewish day schools on Manhattan’s Upper West Side were closed Friday, and Columbia University closed to the public a day earlier, in anticipation of protests. Across last week, there were large rallies, including in Athens, London, Paris and Sydney. The throng in Australia screamed, “Gas the Jews.”

Closer to home, Palestine supporters filled a theater in Dearborn, Mich., Tuesday where one of the speakers—president of the New Generation for Palestine, Amer Zahr—asserted that “this is not complicated” and that white-supremacist rallies are studded with Israeli flags. He claimed Zionists march down the streets shouting “Death to Arabs,” while pro-Palestinians agitate only for their liberation: “Free, free Palestine.”

Many of the young and those on the progressive left have responded with enthusiasm, their thinking muddled by disinformation and a profound ahistoricism—and, in some cases, Jewish self-hatred.

As the script always goes, Israel has been given a pass for a few days in which it can elicit sympathy, before the country is demonized again as the sole aggressor in the region and Jews fall victim to open, unbridled declarations of anti-Semitism.

Meanwhile, I think of Tal. I wrote to her gallery in Israel to clarify her fate and was thrilled to learn that she survived, after hiding for 17 hours in her bomb shelter. Her family survived too, but 52 people in the kibbutz were killed, seven taken hostage, and 13 others are missing. In my mind’s eye, I see her drawings flapping in a faint breeze on a wall that has been left standing amid the destruction, speaking to a spirit of inclusiveness and tolerance that has evaded the Mideast since the day Israel was proclaimed a state.

Don’t Hire My Anti-Semitic Law Students,2023-10-15T20:30:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Steven Davidoff Solomon'],"I teach corporate law at the University of California, Berkeley, and I’m an adviser to the Jewish law students association. My students are largely engaged and well-prepared, and I regularly recommend them to legal employers.

But if you don’t want to hire people who advocate hate and practice discrimination, don’t hire some of my students. Anti-Semitic conduct is nothing new on university campuses, including here at Berkeley.

Last year, Berkeley’s Law Students for Justice in Palestine asked other student groups to adopt a bylaw that banned supporters of Israel from speaking at events. It excluded any speaker who “expressed and continued to hold views or host/sponsor/promote events in support of Zionism, the apartheid state of Israel, and the occupation of Palestine.” Nine student groups adopted the bylaw. Signers included the Middle Eastern and North African Law Students Association, the Queer Caucus and the Women of Berkeley Law.

The bylaw caused an uproar. It was rightly criticized for creating “Jew-free” zones. Our dean—a diehard liberal—admirably condemned it but said free-speech principles tied his hands. The campus groups had the legal right to pick or exclude speakers based on their views. The bylaw remains, and 11 other groups subsequently adopted it.

You don’t need an advanced degree to see why this bylaw is wrong. For millennia, Jews have prayed, “next year in Jerusalem,” capturing how central the idea of a homeland is to Jewish identity. By excluding Jews from their homeland—after Jews have already endured thousands of years of persecution—these organizations are engaging in anti-Semitism and dehumanizing Jews. They didn’t include Jewish law students in the conversation when circulating the bylaw. They also singled out Jews for wanting what we all should have—a homeland and haven from persecution.

The student conduct at Berkeley is part of the broader attitude against Jews on university campuses that made last week’s massacre possible. It is shameful and has been tolerated for too long.

It’s time for the adults to take over, and that includes law firms looking for graduates to hire. The law firm Winston & Strawn revoked an employment offer for a student at New York University law school who wrote an open letter that pointedly refused to condemn Hamas’s attack. The letter denounced Israel instead and asserted that its “regime of state-sanctioned violence created the conditions that made resistance necessary.” The NYU law school dean had issued a tepid response to the massacres, but after the student’s anti-Israel screed caused an uproar, he made a second, more forceful statement condemning Hamas’s attack.

Legal employers in the recruiting process should do what Winston & Strawn did: treat these law students like the adults they are. If a student endorses hate, dehumanization or anti-Semitism, don’t hire him. When students face consequences for their actions, they straighten up.

If you are a legal employer, when you interview students from Berkeley, Harvard, NYU or any other law school this year, ask them what organizations they belong to. Ask if they support discriminatory bylaws or other acts and resolutions blaming Jews and Israelis for the Hamas massacre. If a student endorses hatred, it isn’t only your right but your duty not to hire him. Do you want your clients represented by someone who condones these monstrous crimes?

Hamas’s Enablers Should Take Gaza Refugees,2023-10-15T18:58:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Mark Dubowitz', 'Jonathan Schanzer']","Thousands of civilians in Gaza are about to endure another nightmare brought on by Hamas’s mass slaughter and kidnapping of Israelis and foreign nationals. Now that the border between Israel and Gaza is mostly under control, Israeli forces are preparing for a ground invasion to end Hamas’s brutal rule. The battle isn’t likely to end quickly.

Civilians are seeking to flee in advance of the fighting, and we shouldn’t expect Israel to take them in. With nowhere else to go, Egypt is the only possible escape route for Palestinians hoping to find refuge by land.

The U.S. has already started to discuss this with the government of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, according to recent reports. An Israeli military spokesman, when asked by reporters where displaced persons might go, suggested Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula is the logical location. He added, “Anyone who can get out, I would advise them to get out.” In an interview with Army Radio, Israel’s Education Minister Yoav Kisch also said that Palestinians seeking to flee Gaza should look to Egypt.

The Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border is open. The Israeli military issued a statement on Oct. 10 indicating that it was briefly closed. Egyptian officials later told Reuters that operations at Rafah had been disrupted by a nearby Israeli airstrike but had reopened shortly afterward, at least for humanitarian purposes. On Sunday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that Hamas has been preventing people from leaving through the Rafah crossing.

Egypt may not be thrilled about the role it is being asked to play. Egyptian security sources have said it wouldn’t permit a mass exodus of Palestinians from Gaza to Sinai. Cairo is deeply skeptical of Hamas, given the terrorist organization’s roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt’s government views as a threat. Moreover, Cairo has consistently tried to distance itself from any responsibility for Gaza, which it occupied between 1948 and 1967.

In recent years, Egypt has played a crucial role in negotiating cease-fires between Israel and Hamas, but it has balked at doing much more than that. Notably, then President Donald Trump’s 2020 plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace had to be rewritten after Cairo objected to the idea of setting up industrial zones in Sinai to employ Gazans.

But Egypt doesn’t need to be the final destination for Palestinians looking to escape. Cairo should call for a special session of the Arab League to wrestle with the sensitive topic of Gazan refugees. Nations that have normalized relations with Israel—such as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco—and those that could in the future, like Saudi Arabia, might then discuss a novel solution: urging Hamas’s sponsors and enablers to take responsibility. Iran, Hamas’s chief financier and arms supplier, should absorb the majority of Gazans looking to flee. Talks over the summer already set the stage for direct flights between Tehran and Cairo. The regime has cynically boosted Palestinian jihadists for decades, which has brought misery and destruction not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq—anywhere terror proxies operate.

Turkey and Qatar are two other countries that have offered material and financial support to the mass-murdering Islamist group. Both nations maintain operational Hamas headquarters within their borders. Malaysia also has been a haven for Hamas in years past, with operatives dabbling in weapons development and other research that should never have been allowed. Algeria and Kuwait have cheered on Hamas’s violent and brutal tactics through government statements and state-owned media. Each of these countries should be called on to take ownership of their terrible decisions.

Though these regimes are likely to bristle at such demands, they shouldn’t be given a pass. What’s more, if Egypt were to offer its territory as a haven, it would have the moral high ground to urge these states to do their part.

Another move that should be taken is to deploy the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to Sinai to help refugees. The agency already operates in Gaza and would presumably be ordered out during an evacuation. For decades, the agency has perpetuated the fiction of a Palestinian refugee problem and played a role in radicalizing generations of Palestinians. The agency, created to help refugees from the 1948 war, should have been disbanded decades ago. Yet it persists. Faced with a major conflict, it now has an opportunity to serve actual Palestinian refugees, not merely their descendants. It should retool its mission to handle the impending crisis.

The Middle East is on the precipice of significant change and tumult as a result of Hamas’s Iran-backed assault. World leaders will need to be flexible to handle the challenges that will emerge—and pay a portion of the bill they’ve long shirked.

‘Our Enemies Are the CEOs . . . Our Comrades Are in Gaza’,2023-10-15T18:56:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Allysia Finley'],"Liberals and conservatives alike roundly admonished Donald Trump in 2017, when he blamed “both sides” for violence at a Charlottesville, Va., protest over the removal of a Confederate statute.

“President Trump’s remarks yesterday were reprehensible,” Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry wrote in a statement. “He doubled down on blaming ‘both sides’ for the hatred, bigotry and violence” rather than stand up to “the white supremacists and their racist, anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic and anti-LGBTQ views.”

Six years later, Ms. Henry and others on the left are equivocating and blaming both sides for Hamas’s terrorist war against Israel. “The violence in Israel and Palestine is unconscionable,” Ms. Henry tweeted on Oct. 10. “@SEIU stands with all who are suffering, while strongly condemning anti-Semitism, Islamophobia & hate in all forms.”

Mr. Trump’s opponents accused him of empowering neo-Nazis, but Hamas’s jihad against Israel has exposed that the fiercest anti-Semites are on the left. Perhaps that’s because left-wing activists view Israel’s economic prosperity and Gaza’s poverty through an anticapitalist lens, which holds that all wealth is generated from exploitation.

Consider statements by lower-level SEIU leaders expressing solidarity with Hamas and its cause.

“The apartheid state of Israel is continuing to break international law & wage horrific crimes against humanity. We unwaveringly stand with the families & children of Palestine,” an SEIU Starbucks Workers United affiliate in Chicago tweeted. A union affiliate in upstate New York added: “The labor movement must support liberation for all and fight all forms of oppression.”

“Freeing Palestine was never going to be flowers and baby animals. What the [expletive] did you expect?” another Starbucks Workers United activist tweeted, blaming the U.S. for being “complicit in oncoming destruction and ethnic cleansing” of Gazans by Israel.

“Our bosses, our government want us to think [Hamas] are enemies of working class people, but they are not,” Kooper Caraway, executive director of the SEIU Connecticut State Council, exclaimed at an anti-Israel rally in New Haven, Conn. “Our enemies are the CEOs,” and “our comrades are in Gaza,” he added before denouncing capitalism, “colonialism” and “occupation.”

Young liberals increasingly view these disparate systems as synonymous. They evidently believe that Israel’s relative affluence derives from its exploitation of poor Palestinians. They forget—or never learned—that during its first few decades modern Israel was socialist and poor.

Beginning in the 1980s, thanks in part to advocacy from future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, free-market reforms unleashed economic prosperity. The nation’s per capita income is now more than 10 times that of the West Bank and Gaza. These reforms included tax cuts, privatization and financial deregulation to boost private investment.

“In the mid-1980s, Yitzhak Shamir’s Likud government, with Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu as its United Nations ambassador, did cut taxes—increasing the rewards of work and investment by some 30 percent, dramatically boosting economic growth, and reducing inflation,” investor George Gilder wrote in a 2009 piece for City Journal, “Silicon Israel.”

“As prime minister in the 1990s, Netanyahu also ushered in dramatic deregulation, along with tax cuts that brought in floods of new revenue,” Mr. Gilder writes. Israel used this surge of revenue to create incentives for startup businesses and to develop public works such as water-desalination plants, which have supported a growing population despite Israel’s lack of natural resources.

During the 2000s, Israel legalized investment banks, international private-equity funds and performance fees for hedge funds. “Eliminated were double taxes not merely on investments in Israel but also on international investment activities by Israelis,” Mr. Gilder adds. This unleashed private capital and business development.

Between 1991 and 2000, the nation’s annual venture-capital investment surged to $3.3 billion from $58 million. “By 1998, Israel had 140 scientists and engineers per 10,000 in its labor force, becoming the world leader in these terms, followed by the United States with 80, and Germany with 55,” Israeli-Canadian economist Reuven Brenner writes in a 2019 article for Law & Liberty.

Often referred to as “startup nation,” Israel now leads the world in venture capital per capita. While it still has relatively high individual income taxes and heavy business regulation, its social-welfare spending is lower as a percentage of gross domestic product than that of the U.S. and most European countries. Israel also spends more of its GDP on defense than any other developed country, a necessity in a hostile neighborhood.

Compared with the rest of the Middle East, Israel is a free-market mecca. That’s not the only reason Israelis have grown wealthy while Palestinians and neighboring Arabs remain impoverished. Soviet emigres also provided a burst of human capital, and Israeli schools place a high emphasis on meritocracy.

Yet union and progressive activists are so blinded by their disdain for capitalism that they can’t bring themselves to acknowledge the role of economic freedom in creating Israel’s prosperity. Instead, they spin an intellectually bankrupt narrative about colonialism. Their obsession with grievance and ideology leads them to rationalize the worst of humanity.

She and her family hoped that the hospital would be spared from the bombing that rained down on their city.

Then came Israel’s call for Palestinians to evacuate, conveyed in leaflets dropped from the sky and printed with a map showing Gaza cut in half, with an arrow pointing south. Abu Amra asked a doctor whether she could stay in the hospital.

“We can’t do anything. Everyone is responsible for themselves,” was the reply, she said.

Abu Amra decided that she had little choice but to join those moving south in a panicked search for safety.

“I may not be alive after this,” she said in a voice message to The Wall Street Journal. “I’m saying goodbye to everything I really love.”

Israel’s evacuation warning, as it bombarded the Gaza Strip and prepared for a ground offensive against Hamas militants in the territory, pushed Palestinians to make a terrible choice: stay and risk death as the war intensifies or abandon their homes for what many fear will be permanent exile.

Families walked along a road leading south from Gaza City on Friday, carrying blankets and clothing in plastic bags, their faces blank with exhaustion. Others piled into cars or onto the back of a flatbed truck rumbling southward.

Some Gazans vowed to stay in their homes. Some parted with relatives in tearful goodbyes. A few posted online a last will and testament.

The evacuation order accelerated a frantic rush by the more than 2.3 million people in the Gaza Strip, where more than 420,000 people have already fled their homes. Some have tried unsuccessfully to leave via the enclave’s border crossing with Egypt, which closed earlier this week after Israeli airstrikes struck the Palestinian side of the border. Egypt has resisted international pressure to open the border to allow more civilians to leave.

Israel launched waves of airstrikes and imposed a total siege on the Gaza Strip in response to a cross-border raid last weekend in which Hamas militants killed more than 1,300 Israelis, mostly civilians, including partygoers at a music festival and residents of kibbutz communities. The gunmen seized more than 100 hostages, taking them back into Gaza.

Israel’s bombing in Gaza since Saturday has killed more than 1,500 Palestinians, according to the enclave’s health ministry.

Israel’s evacuation warning came as many Gazans were already sheltering in relatives’ homes, hospitals, hotels, United Nations-run schools, and anywhere they saw as relatively safe from the bombing.

The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has deepened by the day since Israel cut off all supplies of food, fuel, medicine, water, and electricity. The strip’s power plant and water desalination plants have stopped working.

Human waste flowed into the streets in some neighborhoods after 53 of Gaza’s 65 sewage pumping stations stopped working. Palestinian residents are spending their nights in the dark as the explosions rock their buildings and missiles slam into apartment blocks.

Israel has said its aim is to crush Hamas and remove it as the ruling power in Gaza, setting up what is expected to be a long and difficult war. The Israeli air force has said its strikes are causing “maximum damage.” Israeli officials say they have limited capacity for precision strikes because its forces are stretched thin.

“We will make sure this threat does not exist on our borders. It will be lengthy. It will be lethal. It will be powerful. And it will be for forever,” said Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in comments to reporters alongside U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday.

The U.N. has urged Israel to rescind its evacuation order, saying it will only cause further misery.

“The scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone-chilling. Gaza is fast becoming a hell hole and is on the brink of collapse,” said Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestine Refugees.

Israel closed its borders to most Palestinians from Gaza in 2007 after Hamas seized full control of the strip in a military takeover that followed its 2006 victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections.

The closure isolated Gaza and ended decades in which many Gazans worked in Israel and moved freely throughout the country. Israel granted thousands of work permits to Gazans in recent years, but entry has remained off limits for most people from the territory.

Palestinians who fled southward from Gaza City this week said they felt bewildered, saying that nowhere in Gaza is safe during the bombing campaign, in which Israel has launched hundreds of airstrikes and thousands of tons of munitions, leaving streets strewn with rubble.

The strikes have hit hospitals, mosques and schools, and destroyed a total of more than 700 buildings, according to the U.N. “The emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israeli military, in a briefing for local media earlier this week. Asked about strikes on civilian buildings, the Israel Defense Forces said, “The IDF exclusively targets sites associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.”

The majority of internally displaced people in Gaza are sheltering in schools run by the U.N. Israeli strikes have hit 20 U.N. schools, including two that were being used as emergency shelters for displaced people, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when asked about Israel’s broad order for Gazans to move to the south, said the U.S. is seeking to create “safe zones” within Gaza with the International Committee of the Red Cross and others.

Seham Bseiso, a Palestinian-Moroccan dual citizen and mother of two, fled from Gaza City to Deir al-Balah in the southern part of the Gaza Strip with her children and some of her extended family.

“Everywhere seems to be shelled. We came to Deir al-Balah, but we really don’t know if we made the right call or not. We were told that the coast road was not being shelled at one moment so we went through, maybe we were lucky, because it was targeted again,” she said.

“We are hostages to rumors and acting on instinct, but we don’t know, we are told to leave, but we are not told how,” she said.

People living in the areas to the south of Gaza City said they were taking in displaced people from the northern part of the strip.

“I hosted a family today. I don’t know who they are, but they fled from Gaza and sought refuge here,” said Reem Buhaisi, a worker for a nongovernmental organization living in Deir Al-Balah.

Buhaisi said the area had come under heavy bombing on Thursday night, killing several relatives from her sister’s family. Her surviving relatives came to shelter in her house.

“We have no electricity, food, or water. All I want is some water to wash the blood out of my nephew’s clothes,” she said.

Some residents of Gaza vowed to remain, resisting what they said was an attempt to forcibly displace civilians that they compared with the 1948 mass expulsion of more than 700,000 Palestinians during the war at the founding of Israel. Palestinians refer to the mass exodus as Al-Nakba, the Catastrophe. The majority of Gaza residents are those displaced in 1948 and their descendants.

“I am not leaving my home. I am not going to be a refugee again. I am already a Palestinian refugee,” said Mahmoud Shalabi, a senior program manager for Medical Aid for Palestinians, a London-based charity, who lives on the outskirts of Beit Lahia in the north of Gaza. “I will die standing.”

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
The Marxian Roots of Campus Anti-Semitism,2023-10-13T21:20:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Barton Swaim'],"If you thought claims of anti-Semitism on university campuses were exaggerated, you can’t think it after the past week. The spectacle was appalling: university presidents responding to the murder of hundreds of Jews by pretending that the fault lies partially with Israel and that reasonable people can differ over whether Hamas’s atrocities are justified; student groups issuing letters proclaiming solidarity with Hamas; campus protesters brandishing signs bearing such slogans as “resistance is justified” and “from the river to the sea”—the latter signifying the goal of extirpating all Jews from Israel.

How is it possible hundreds of Jewish civilians—including children and the elderly—were gunned down, bombed in their homes, raped, abducted and beheaded, and some of America’s elite students, academics and college administrators commiserated with the perpetrators? Again and again you hear otherwise intelligent people expressing vacuous phrases—“state-sanctioned violence,” “Zionist apartheid”—solely to excuse the butchery of Jews.

They will hotly deny that they hate Jews, but their denials don’t bear scrutiny. Even if all they say about Israel were true—in fact, it’s filled with distortions and lies—you’d still be left wondering why they’re unbothered by brutality when carried out by Hamas or anyone else other than Israel.

Where are the campus protests against Chinese concentration camps in Xinjiang? Governments brutalize citizens in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria and many other places, but this week’s campus demonstrators bring their placards to the quadrangle only against the Jewish state.

That anti-Israel protests erupted on elite campuses this week—not after the accidental killing of a Palestinian demonstrator but after the systematic murder of at least 1,300 people in Israel—signifies an egregious failure at the heart of American higher education. That so many students and academics could think this was a proper response to an act of mass murder suggests something deeply amiss on our campuses. What we are witnessing is the fruition, many decades in the making, of a habit of mind that can accurately be called Marxian.

It was Karl Marx who, in “Das Kapital,” first argued that the wage earner in a capitalist economy never works for himself but only for the owner of the means of production. The capitalist appropriated as “profit” his “surplus labor”—that is, work beyond what was necessary to keep the operation going. The taking of surplus labor Marx called “exploitation.” This little idea—that the wealthy capitalist makes his millions by expropriating what rightly belongs to the worker—cast a spell on the minds of 19th- and early-20th-century radical intellectuals. It was a total misunderstanding of economic value, and philosophically it was akin to saying “up is down” or “blue is red”—nonsense in practice, but in theory who could contradict it?

Notwithstanding many dauntless efforts over several generations to defend regulated market economies as just, the belief that profit is theft, that prosperity under capitalism is taken from the poor laborer by force, is so much a part of today’s left-progressive mindset as to be unquestioned and immovable. The entire “social justice” movement is premised on the belief that if one group does well and another doesn’t, the former must have taken advantage of the latter—a thousand explanatory circumstances be damned. (See Thomas Sowell’s latest book, “Social Justice Fallacies,” for a brilliant treatment of the subject.) You can hear Marx’s concept of exploitation in Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s constant assertion that successful corporations and wealthy Americans have somehow gamed the system at the expense of the poor and middle class.

There’s an irony here. For America’s credentialed elite to take the Marxian view that prosperity is evidence of exploitation requires skill in the art of self-exculpation. Ms. Warren herself is wealthy. The vast preponderance of the anti-Israel students at Harvard, Stanford and other elite campuses are the products of privileged and well-connected upbringings. Shouldn’t they fix their attentions on their own acts of exploitation? Maybe, but their use of electric cars and belief in the right progressive causes expiate their guilt, and anyway it’s far easier to accuse others.

That’s why they particularly hate Israel—a wealthy nation among neighbors whose poverty is relieved only by oil revenue. Israel is the one country in the Middle East where ordinary people stand a good chance of creating prosperity for themselves and their families. For modern progressive academics, weaned on the Marxian concept that wealth is the result of exploitation, that is precisely the reason for Israel’s guilt. They can’t behold its prosperity without concluding that the Jews have stolen their wealth from their neighbors.

Other developed nations are targets of radical denunciations for their alleged histories of expropriation—especially the U.S., not coincidentally Israel’s greatest ally and financial supporter, and the place where many Jews found a haven even before modern Israel’s founding. But there must be few campus radicals prepared to demand that all American territory be given back to Native Americans. For our campus-dwelling anti-Semites, however, Israel’s removal is the goal.

Democratic political leaders, who have credibility on elite campuses their Republican colleagues lack, have a duty to denounce these spineless university presidents and fomenters of anti-Israel bigotry. Jew-hatred among the cognoscenti has a history of spreading faster than anybody expected.

What Israeli Victory Would Look Like,2023-10-13T21:18:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Elliot Kaufman'],"“I’m driving south to the Gaza corridor, the place Hamas invaded on Saturday,” Yonah Jeremy Bob says in our first phone conversation. “But it’s a straight drive, so let’s talk.” Mr. Bob is an expert on the Israeli shadow war with Iran, the subject of his new book, “Target Tehran,” and he covers the Israeli intelligence agencies and military for the Jerusalem Post. He’s busy tracking down answers to the questions every Israeli wants answered: How could this have happened? What’s the plan? Who will pay?

Even after the corpses of Israeli civilians had been cleared, “it’s some sort of nightmare,” Mr. Bob says when we catch up later on Wednesday. “What I saw was once a living, happy place, and it has been utterly destroyed.”

Israeli intelligence misjudged Hamas. “In the worst case,” Mr. Bob says, the expectation was that “Hamas might be able to take over one village that’s really small for three hours” and kill 20 people. “There was no scenario where anybody talked about 22 villages, a whole area of the country, 1,200 Israelis killed, including 800 to 900 civilians. That wasn’t conceivable.”

Saturday’s shock gave way to rage, “and then rage crystallized into a very steely determination,” Mr. Bob says. “It’s the thing Israel’s enemies never fully understand. They think of Israel as a weak Western state, where people care about their looks and money and all the things that will make them flee rather than fight.” Hamas often scoffs that “the Jews love life.” But that’s why they fight for it.

“Hamas was playing the long game,” Mr. Bob says. “Probably after the 2021 war”—in which Israel delivered it a beating—“Hamas diagnosed everything we did and took notes and started to plan.” When Israel next fought in Gaza, with Islamic Jihad, Hamas stayed out. Then, having lulled Israel, it executed a devastating plan.

“They fire 2,000 rockets in one day. They’d never fired that many rockets at once,” Mr. Bob says. But it was all a diversion. While Israel focused on the unprecedented barrage, Hamas deployed men on “motorized hang gliders, which were not even on our radar [as a threat], and dropped makeshift bombs on our lookouts. So, when they start sending people to the border fence, we’re blind. . . . They attack the big border crossings first, so we send reinforcements there, which means we leave the other spots open. We don’t realize that our lookouts are dead or blown up because we’re thinking about the rockets and they’re attacking everywhere at once.”

Each stage of the attack prepared the next, and each involved something new. “In terms of military strategy, they schooled us.”

It wasn’t unreasonable for Israelis to think they had deterred Hamas, Mr. Bob says. “But you need to plan for every eventuality.” That was the lesson of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which has become an Israeli metonym for military disaster. But Mr. Bob notes that war had a second half. “By the end, Israel had in some ways an even greater tactical triumph than in ’67. It retook the Sinai, which became the basis of the peace agreement with Egypt.”

He sees a similar two-part story here. “Hamas took its best shot and it won big on the first day,” he says. “But it really doesn’t have anything else. It isn’t going to accomplish anything else close to what it has already done. From here on, it’s going to be Israel demolishing them.”

Israel has issued one of its largest military call-ups ever, 360,000 reservists. Its comprehensive bombing campaign and siege tactics are laying the groundwork for a counterinvasion to destroy Hamas. “They decided that they need to get rid of the people who are running Hamas, and most of their military force, and most of their weaponry.” Mr. Bob says. But as Aaron MacLean writes in Mosaic, “Were the IDF simply to withdraw after a maximal campaign, the last surviving member of the Qassam Brigades will, as it were, grab a bloody Hamas flag, wave it for the cameras, and declare victory.” Gaza would still be fertile soil for terrorists.

That why’s regime change is on the table, too. Israelis used to worry that it might cost 1,000 soldiers to topple Hamas, and that ISIS could fill the vacuum. But by letting Hamas reign, Mr. Bob says, “We’ve now lost 1,200 people,” and Hamas is no better than ISIS. “So nobody has a hesitancy.”

That doesn’t mean Israelis want to govern Gaza themselves. “I still think Israel feels that it would be more trouble, that more soldiers would die over a long period of time, and it would rather hand Gaza back to somebody else,” Mr. Bob says. But to whom? “The Palestinian Authority was routed there in the past. Why wouldn’t that happen again? If multinational forces in Lebanon and the Sinai have shown that they’re incapable of protecting Israeli interests, why would this time be any different?”

Israel could turn to a hybrid solution, with autonomy for the Palestinian Authority, helped by a multinational group, and the Israeli military in some way involved to prevent a Hamas comeback. “That is utter speculation on my part,” Mr. Bob says. “No matter how hard you push it, officials right now are not hinting what their plans are for afterward. I think it’s because they haven’t decided.”

Perhaps unsure how to win the peace, Israel is focusing on total victory in the field. “Hezbollah is the strategic threat,” Mr. Bob says, and a second front in the north would spell trouble. “Israel would win, but it would look different.”

He says Israeli intelligence believes Hezbollah could fire 6,000 to 8,000 rockets a day early in a conflict, several times Hamas’s capability. “If you’re shooting down 90% of 2,000 rockets versus 90% of 6,000 or 8,000, it makes a huge difference. And probably the intercept rate drops to 80% because of the volume.” No Israeli leader would welcome that conflict, Mr. Bob says, even if it could generate a more decisive victory over the Iranian proxy network.

Hezbollah has fired on Israel and started cross-border skirmishes in the past week—“small things,” he says. Israel has so far declined to escalate. “It’ll kill whoever shot at it,” and maybe the people around it, but that’s it. “Clearly, Israel doesn’t want to be distracted by another fight.”

But the enemy has a say. Does Hezbollah want to fight? Mr. Bob thinks not. If it had been waiting “for the right moment to strike, it missed its chance” by holding back in the massacre’s immediate aftermath, Mr. Bob says.

Instead, “Hezbollah has been as careful as Israel. It wants to be seen as having gotten on the playing field and drawn blood, . . . not being cowardly and staying out. But unless something changes, since Saturday it has basically been cowardly and stayed out.” Its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, “has a lot to lose,” Mr. Bob says. “He basically controls a real country. I mean, Lebanon’s a mess, but he has real power. It isn’t Gaza.”

Mr. Bob acknowledges that the situation is fluid, and new orders could always come down from Tehran. Ultimately, that’s the point. Israelis may need to think big right now. “Israel will beat Hamas, but there’s still going to be the larger problem of Iran,” a revolutionary theocratic regime devoted to Israel’s destruction.

The Obama and Biden administrations have assumed that the right combination of incentives can moderate Iran’s ambitions. Surely, given a choice between prosperity and hardship, between fellowship and enmity, Iran would do the reasonable thing. It can be hard for Americans, who also love life, to understand a regime that chooses multigenerational sacrifice to make its dream of annihilating Israel come true.

“Iran is aggressively pushing Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah—anybody it can—to fight Israel, to make trouble with Israel, to destroy Israel. It’s giving funding, logistics and training for that purpose,” Mr. Bob says. Even if “nobody has been willing to go on the record and say, ‘Iran gave the order on this day,’ everybody would say that Iran’s fingerprints are on the idea of it, which would happen at some point.”

But perhaps the ayatollahs should have been careful what they wished for. “On Saturday, I think the Iranians are feeling great,” Mr. Bob says. “But when they see how much damage Israel is going to do to Hamas in response, and proxies that they’ve invested so much in are going to lose most or all of their power, they’re going to say, ‘This wasn’t worth it. These Israelis don’t turn the other cheek.’ ”

Not only proxies will feel the pain. “The Mossad’s abilities within Iran are astounding,” Mr. Bob says, referring to the Israeli intelligence agency. He points to “multiple instances when Israel went into Iran, kidnapped top Iranian officials, interrogated them within Iran, put the videos out, and then left the country without anybody knowing.” Mr. Bob’s years of “working to penetrate to top Mossad sources, all of the chiefs, and a lot of other people” lead him to conclude: “If the Mossad wants to go after someone in Iran, it can.”

Asked what Israel needs from the U.S. now, Mr. Bob rattles off four answers. First, “give Israel bunker-buster bombs.” Second, “declare that the U.S. won’t pressure Israel to prematurely halt its counterinvasion,” even as civilian casualties inevitably follow. Third, “shoot down one Hezbollah or Hamas rocket to show that the U.S. is willing to lean into this, and the naval movements aren’t for show.” Fourth, “move up delivery of the KC-46 refueling planes.”

It’s a plan of action whose meaning would be clear to Tehran. The bunker buster is a “dream weapon” for any potential strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities. Since Iran knows these bombs and KC-46 planes would “transform what Israel might be willing to risk,” he says, their transfer would make it think twice about ordering Hezbollah into the war. “Do I really want my proxy to do X, Y or Z, which could lead to an overreaction?” he imagines Ayatollah Ali Khamenei asking. “The spectrum of those ‘overreactions’ that Israel could offer would be much greater. And that could affect Iran’s calculations in every zone.”

One effect would be to deter a sprint to a nuclear breakout, which some fear Iran will try while Israel is distracted. Iran “could get to the 90% weaponized uranium enrichment level in either days or a week and a half,” Mr. Bob says.

President Biden has been weak on Iran, but his support for Israel after Hamas’s invasion has been steadfast. Ophir Falk, a foreign-policy adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, praises Mr. Biden’s remarks Tuesday on the subject: “We’re cynical and everything, but it was one of the most moving speeches that I’ve ever heard.”

Israelis know all too well, however, how fickle the world’s sympathies can be. Half the point of the state of Israel is to free the Jews from dependence on those sympathies. “There was shock when people saw the pictures,” Mr. Bob says, “but that lasts for only so long.” Israel’s assault on Gaza will lead to “new pictures on the Palestinian side” and moral equivocation from the West. That’s when Israel needs the U.S. to stand firm, because no one else will.

Mr. Falk says, “I truly hope, and I actually expect, that the civilized world will support us not only when we’re the victims, but also when we’re the victors here.” Victory might also save the prospects for a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia. “In this neighborhood, the strong survive,” Mr. Falk says. “The main reason that prior peace agreements were reached was because we’re strong.”

But if the peace plan goes by the boards, too bad. As Mr. Bob puts it, “This isn’t the Jew of the ghetto for 2,000 years. This is the modern Israeli army, which will do what it needs to do to defend the state.” Israeli society may be “richer and a little more spoiled now than it once was,” no longer the Jewish Sparta of the early days. “But underneath, there’s a determination that should not be underestimated. That’s what I’ve seen the past few days. You’re going to see more of that.”

Muslims Across Middle East Rally in Support of Palestinians,2023-10-13T17:35:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Sune Engel Rasmussen', 'Suha Ma Ayeh']","AMMAN, Jordan—Supporters of Palestinians gathered across the Middle East to protest after Friday prayers in a show of solidarity as Israeli forces prepared to launch a ground invasion against militant group Hamas in Gaza in response to last weekend’s deadly attack on Israel.

Israel’s air strikes in the Gaza Strip have stoked concern and anger among Arabs and others in the region over the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory. Under siege, Gaza is running out of food, water, electricity and fuel, while Palestinians trying to flee to safety have nowhere to go.

Tens of thousands of protesters rallied in Tahrir Square in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, burning large Israeli flags. In Iran, which supports Hamas with arms, training and money, crowds of thousands carried banners reading “Down with Israel” and waved Palestinian flags. The Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon held a rally in the southern suburbs of Beirut.

“The issue of Palestine will not end by destroying Gaza,” Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi told a crowd in southern Iran. “The people of Palestine and the world will hold you accountable because we consider defending Palestine as our duty,” he said, according to Iranian state media.

Protests also erupted at Cairo’s Al Azhar mosque, the seat of Sunni Islamic learning, despite Egyptian restrictions on demonstrations. Smaller crowds gathered in the Persian Gulf states of Bahrain and Qatar, and in Tunisia. Syria, an ally of Hamas, doesn’t permit protests, and neither does Saudi Arabia, where demonstrations were also absent from the streets.

The Palestinian struggle for self-determination has been an emotive issue across the region for decades, and the war could undermine efforts to improve diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab states. It has the potential to derail U.S.-mediated talks to normalize ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which gathered pace over the summer.

More than 1,300 Israelis, including many civilians, were killed when Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union, launched a surprise attack last weekend. Its fighters targeted military bases and towns in southern Israel, also kidnapping at least 100 hostages.

In response to Saturday’s attack, Israel has said it aimed to destroy Hamas. The Israeli Air Force said it has dropped about 6,000 bombs targeting Hamas sites and officials in Gaza since Saturday. It has mobilized troops and tanks on Gaza’s border and asked people in Gaza City to evacuate because military operations would take place there.

Almost 1,800 Palestinians have been killed so far, more than half of them women and children, and more than 7,400 wounded, according to the health authority in Gaza.

The war between Israel and Hamas risks drawing in other Iran-backed militant groups across the region, especially Hezbollah.

“Hezbollah knows its duties very well and we are ready and fully prepared,” Hezbollah’s deputy secretary-general Naim Qassem said in the Beirut rally. “The Israeli goal of wiping out Gaza will be a path to their extinction,” he added.

Hamas called on Palestinians to march to the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City, a flashpoint religious site where Israeli police have clashed repeatedly with Palestinians in the past. Israeli security blocked the roads leading to the mosque.

Hamas also called on its supporters in the occupied West Bank to confront Israeli troops. Thousands gathered in Ramallah, the West Bank’s administrative center, including people cheering in support of Hamas.

“We are the men of Mohammed Deif,” some of the protesters chanted, referring to the commander of Hamas’s armed wing. Israeli security forces dispersed protesters with live ammunition and tear gas as they marched toward Beit El, a nearby Israeli settlement.

At least nine Palestinians were killed in the West Bank after clashes broke out between protesters and Israeli security forces, according to the Palestinian health ministry.

A spokesman for the Israeli military didn’t confirm or deny that Palestinians were killed in clashes with security forces in the West Bank. The military said there were violent riots throughout the West Bank during which Palestinians lit and rolled burning tires, threw Molotov cocktails and stones and, in several areas, armed persons fired at the forces. The troops used riot dispersal means and in a number of cases also live fire toward those who posed a danger to the forces, according to the spokesman.

The rising acrimony in the West Bank could throw the area into further escalation with Israel after a year of violent flare-ups. The Israeli army has said it would supply thousands of firearms to licensed citizens across the country to defend themselves, and that anyone challenging Israel in the West Bank will be met with “huge force.”

National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said this week, “we will be ensuring that we are prepared, with guns on every street corner.”

The Palestinian Authority, which partly governs the West Bank and is led by Fatah, a rival of Hamas, has expressed solidarity with Gaza and warned that arming settlers risked blowing things up in the West Bank.

In Jordan, a staunch regional ally of the U.S., authorities used tear gas on protesters headed toward the border with the West Bank, and blocked cars traveling on the highway in that direction, after issuing a ban on rallies on the border.

In downtown Amman, the Jordanian capital, thousands of protesters gathered under heavy security presence after Friday prayer in a peaceful demonstration. The rally, attended by Jordanians and Palestinians, was called by the Muslim Brotherhood, which in a message Thursday called on the country’s government to arm Jordanians.

“We will sacrifice our souls and blood for Al Aqsa,” chanted protesters waving Palestinian flags, referring to the mosque in Jerusalem. “Open, open the borders,” they called, “We are going to Jerusalem in millions.”

Muhammad Qassem, a car dealer, said he rallied to protect the dignity of the Arab world and for Palestinian liberation. “We want our voices to be heard,” he said.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Border Crisis Invites Terrorists,2023-10-13T18:37:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Paul Mauro'],"What does war in Gaza mean for U.S. homeland security? The sudden outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas creates three broad categories of risk for domestic counterterrorism officials. First among them is America’s porous southern border.

I worked in counterterrorism with the New York City Police Department for 15 years. During that time, an undocumented border-crosser with a bad-guy footprint was a rarity. It’s hard for a foreign terror group to project power overseas. Not only is it expensive to deploy operatives on foreign soil, but doing so is rife with potential points of failure. The discovery of one in New York would have caused a “spin-up” involving major resources from surveillance teams to phone and cyber forensics.

The disaster at the southern border has made it easy for a potential terrorist to slip into the country. Such a “clean skin” is virtually untraceable. To make matters worse, we are inviting these border-crossers to come and paying their way to major terror targets like New York.

The Hamas charter confines the group’s mission to “the liberation of occupied Palestine,” and it hasn’t traditionally been a major actor in the U.S. Hamas’s stateside affiliates have mostly confined themselves to fundraising. But with the unprecedented events unfolding in Gaza, the group must now be considered part of the domestic counterterrorism landscape.

Iran and its proxy Hezbollah stand behind Hamas and have demonstrated a willingness to export terror. In 2011 Iran allegedly plotted from Mexico to murder the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. Hezbollah—with Iran’s backing—has carried out deadly overseas bombings against Jewish targets, including the 1994 attack on a community center in Buenos Aires and the 2012 attack on an Israeli tour bus in Bulgaria.

A second category of risk arises from propaganda. During its rise, ISIS successfully used the “loser to lion” recruiting model. Unlike al Qaeda, ISIS was adept at social media, creating slick videos and images that helped radicalize disaffected young Muslims around the world and invited them to join the jihad against Israel and the West. Hamas has clearly learned these lessons; its media outlets have already begun to disseminate ISIS-like videos depicting the attack on Israel with cinematic drama. Like ISIS, Hamas has released its own app.

Third among the risks are simple copycats who, acting from a legion of potential grievances, decide the time is right to emulate Hamas and lash out. The continuum here goes from the comparatively mild—say, harassing a yarmulke-wearing student on the street—to the violent or even deadly. Unlike a Hamas overseas “recruit,” who will undergo an indoctrination process, a copycat acts more from anger than ideology. The journey to violence can therefore be brief—as sudden as responding to an impulse. This makes copycat terrorists the toughest to interdict.

Counterterrorism officials must also consider the possibility of a major escalation in the war that leads to a military-level strike on the U.S. While such a possibility feels remote, it probably felt equally remote to Parisians in 1939. There is already a land war raging in Eastern Europe. Add to that a Middle East conflict with a high probability of drawing in major powers—including the possibility of direct U.S. involvement—and counterterrorism officials at the federal, state and local levels must spare at least some thought to where all this could be going. Keep in mind that law enforcement already has its hands full with the defund-the-police movement, hostile prosecutors and legislators, and a shortage of personnel and new recruits.

The success of the Hamas attack represents a major failure for Israel’s vaunted intelligence apparatus. But that isn’t the whole story. The public thinks about counterterrorism only when there’s been a failure; the successes stay buried. It can make for thankless work, but that comes with the terrain.

Tensions on College Campuses Mount Over Violence in Middle East,2023-10-13T00:48:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Douglas Belkin', 'Melissa Korn']","The debate on college campuses over the war in Israel and Gaza has taken a dark turn as tensions have led to doxing, shouting matches, online threats and at least one campus assault.

College students on both sides of the conflict say they fear for their safety as acrimony grows. At Harvard, a truck with a digital sign on the back circled the campus Wednesday and Thursday doxing—identifying the names and faces—of students accused of blaming Israel for the Hamas attack last weekend. Protesters on several campuses wore face coverings to avoid being identified and photographed.

Tensions have escalated since the weekend when Hamas militants from Gaza entered Israel and killed an estimated 1,200 people, most of whom were civilians. Israel responded by declaring a siege on Gaza, shutting off access to power, water and fuel and pummeling the territory with airstrikes.

Some campus groups in support of Palestinians issued statements blaming Israel for policies that they said led to the violence, sparking an intense backlash from supporters of Israel and putting pressure on university leaders to condemn the attacks.

In response, some outspoken advocates of Israel have demanded to see the names of the students associated with groups that signed the pro-Palestinian statements.

At Columbia University in New York on Wednesday night, police charged a 19-year-old female student with hitting a male student with a wooden stick after he confronted her as she ripped down posters advertising a rally supporting Israel, according to a New York Police Department report and the Columbia student newspaper.

Thousands of students gathered for hours Thursday on the grounds of Columbia’s Morningside Heights campus, a pro-Palestinian rally on one lawn and a pro-Israel rally on another across the quad.

Amid shouts of “free, free Palestine” and “from Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go,” the pro-Palestinian group held handwritten signs and jeered as a speaker detailed humanitarian conditions in Gaza. Protesters called on the university to stop providing financial support to Israel, including academic programs in Tel Aviv.

Most pro-Palestinian participants wore masks, with dozens declining to identify themselves to a Wall Street Journal reporter or comment generally on why they were masked.

The raucous gathering was juxtaposed by about 20 minutes of silence across the quad, with participants in the pro-Israel rally who held signs with pictures of dead or missing Israelis saying each second of silence represented a person’s death at the hands of Hamas, which the U.S. and other countries deem a terrorist organization. The group then made a circle, shoulder-to-shoulder, swaying as they sang “Oseh Shalom,” a Hebrew song calling for peace.

Elisha Baker, a 20-year-old student studying history and donning an Israeli flag as a cape, said the group’s demonstration was a show of unity among Jewish students.

“We want to show that we’re not going to be intimidated off of this campus. But we’re not going to do it in any sort of a yelling or violent manner, we just want to show our unity and mourn the loss of innocent lives.”

After the official rally ended, the pro-Palestinian group left the lawn and marched through the main pedestrian thoroughfare on campus. Small groups of students holding Israeli flags or wearing Stars of David necklaces watched from the side, tearful.

Students for Justice in Palestine, an umbrella organization that advocates for Palestinians to return to Israel, this week called for Thursday to be a day of protests on campuses around the country. Events were held at several universities, according to social media and published reports.

A rally at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill drew between 200 and 300 people, according to the News & Observer in Raleigh. One counterprotester, supporting Israel, was led away from the rally by university police after he and about a dozen others moved toward the group supporting Palestinians. That man reportedly identified himself as a professor at the university when speaking to police.

At Brooklyn College Thursday afternoon, a group of about 20 people with faces covered by scarves chanted “Hey Hey, Ho Ho, Zionism has Got to Go!” and “Palestine is our Demand, No peace on stolen land,” according to a video posted on Twitter.

One Harvard sophomore, who spoke on the condition of anonymity citing fear for her safety, said several of her friends were among those doxed on the truck circling the campus and were so unnerved they had not left their dorm room, afraid they would be harassed. A note from the school’s executive vice president sent Thursday said the school “does not condone or ignore intimidation.”

In addition to the truck at Harvard, several websites have popped up listing the names and affiliations—and, in some cases, photographs—of students and faculty they believe are linked to anti-Israel groups and activities.

On Wednesday, Max Meyer, who works for a venture-capital firm, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, what he titled “The Terror List,” calling it a guide for employers to find out who has been celebrating the brutality of Hamas’s invasion.

“The goal of the project is to document and preserve public statements that condone, excuse, decline to condemn, or promote violent terrorism against Israeli civilians,” he wrote in an email.

Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago Office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil liberties and advocacy group, said the tactic was designed to intimidate and shut down debate.

“It’s un-American,” he said.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Israel Tells 1.1 Million Civilians to Evacuate Northern Gaza,2023-10-12T11:07:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Chao Deng', 'Dov Lieber', 'William Mauldin', 'Omar Abdel-Baqui']","TEL AVIV—Israel’s military asked civilians in Gaza to move to the southern part of the enclave, signaling a widening offensive and prompting the United Nations to warn of devastating humanitarian consequences.

Israel’s military, just before midnight local time, told the U.N. that its staff and approximately 1.1 million civilians should leave the northern part of the Gaza Strip in the next 24 hours, according to spokesmen for the U.N. and Israel’s military. The U.N. called for Israel to rescind the order, saying it could transform an already tragic situation into a catastrophe.

“Evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields,” the Israeli military told civilians in Gaza, according to a spokesman.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had earlier urged Israel to avoid civilian casualties amid growing fears of a wider regional conflict as Israeli forces embarked on a military campaign to dismantle Hamas, pounding Gaza with airstrikes.

Israel on Thursday gave the clearest indication so far of its war aims, with the military saying it plans to capture or kill all of Hamas’s leaders, destroy the group’s militant units and make it impossible for the group—which the U.S., Israel and others have designated a terrorist organization—to govern Gaza.

“Hamas is ISIS and, just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “No country should harbor them, and those that do should be sanctioned.”

Flanking Netanyahu, Blinken said Israel had the right to defend itself, but the top U.S. diplomat urged the Israeli prime minister to take precautions to avoid harming civilians.

“How Israel does this matters. We democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard,” Blinken said.

Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said airstrikes on Wednesday night targeted a Hamas unit that Israel says was involved in the weekend attack that killed 1,300 Israelis. One of the Hamas operatives killed in the airstrikes was responsible for creating videos of the violence that spread over social media, Hecht said.

“We plan to get to every one of these people—every single one of them,” Hecht said.

Israel’s bombardment of Gaza since Saturday has killed more than 1,500 Palestinians, nearly half of whom are women and children, and has injured more than 6,600, according to the health authority there. More than a dozen health facilities have come under attack, the authority said.

Most of the strip’s more than two million residents have no way of fleeing the enclave, which Israel and Egypt have sealed off for years.

The conflict risks spilling over into a broader regional crisis. Israel has massed about 300,000 reserve troops, positioning many of them near the border with Gaza, ahead of a possible ground invasion.

On Thursday, simultaneous airstrikes hit Syria’s international airports in Damascus and Aleppo, Syria’s state-run media said, blaming Israel for the attacks. Syrian air defenses were responding to the attacks, which rendered both airports nonoperational. The strikes came as the Iranian foreign minister was expected to arrive in the country. The Israeli military declined to comment.

Israeli forces have also exchanged fire with Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group, along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon for four consecutive days. Hezbollah has a powerful militia of fighters who are battle-tested from the war in neighboring Syria and an arsenal of missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel.

Blinken was on a one-day visit to Israel before a tour of Arab countries—Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt—aimed in part at dissuading other states or militant groups from joining the conflict.

Diplomats see Blinken’s tour as an opportunity to map out a public response for Arab capitals if Israel invades Gaza. One Arab diplomat warned that images of a leveled Gaza risk fueling terrorism. It also risks bolstering the legitimacy of Hamas and emboldening Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthis, the diplomat said.

“It’s our determination—and that of Israel as well—that there not be a second front or a third front,” Blinken told reporters Thursday in Tel Aviv.

The Pentagon said a squadron of A-10 ground-attack planes arrived at al Dhafra Air Base, in the United Arab Emirates, on Thursday as part of the Biden administration’s effort to deter further attacks against Israel. The U.A.E.’s defense ministry said the arrival of U.S. aircraft is unrelated to developments in the region and has been taking place for several months.

A U.S. aircraft carrier strike group arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean earlier in the week, and additional squadrons of jet fighters are expected to be in place by next week, U.S. defense officials said.

Western officials are concerned the conflict could spread to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which is partly governed by the Palestinian Authority. Hamas has called for a “general mobilization” throughout the region in support of Palestinians, urging young people in the West Bank to confront Israeli soldiers.

Since Hamas’s surprise assault on Saturday, 35 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces, as well as in deadly incidents with armed Israeli settlers, according to Palestinian and Israeli officials.

In a sign of spreading violence, on Thursday evening, a Palestinian gunman opened fire on Israeli policemen in Jerusalem, injuring two officers, one seriously. Israeli police said the gunman was “neutralized” by officers while fleeing.

In a speech broadcast on Al Jazeera on Thursday night, Abu Obeida, the spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, said the group had been preparing its attack on Saturday since its last conflict with Israel in the spring of 2021. That was the first time the group fought Israel over tensions at holy sites in Jerusalem. He said the group is well prepared for an Israeli ground invasion and called on Palestinians everywhere to join the fight.

“It’s a jihad: It’s either win or get martyred,” he said.

Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said that if Israel didn’t cease its bombing and siege of Gaza, the whole region would “face new situations.”

Blinken on Thursday also met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and members of the cabinet. Later, along with a U.S. hostage negotiator, he met families of American citizens who were killed or still missing after the weekend attacks. The White House said Thursday that the death toll of American citizens has risen to 27 people, while 14 remain unaccounted for. U.S. officials haven’t said how many American citizens they believe to be held hostage by Hamas. Hamas said it had taken dozens of people captive.

The White House also said that the U.S. government would arrange charter flights, beginning Friday, to help evacuate Americans from Israel.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi discussed the conflict in a phone call Wednesday, according to state media in both countries, marking the first such call since diplomatic ties were restored in March.

Asked about the call, a senior U.S. official said it was important that Iran not act on the current situation. “With the detente of Saudi Arabia and Iran formalized in March, I assume the crown prince thought this was an apt moment,” the official said. The official added that Washington was working with all its partners to use their influence to deter Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.

Meanwhile, the U.S. and Qatar agreed to deny Iran access to $6 billion in oil proceeds that Washington had freed up as part of a prisoner swap reached last month, according to people familiar with the matter, amid concerns over Tehran’s long-running support for Hamas.

Israeli interrogations of captured Hamas militants had revealed the whereabouts of key members, Hecht said, as well as military sites, weapons stashes, rocket and antitank-missile launchpads, and areas that the group is trying to penetrate.

Hecht said Hamas is “disoriented right now” with its ability to command and control “a bit out of balance.” Still, the Israeli army was working to secure its borders and get rid of remaining Hamas militants inside Israel as of Wednesday night. More than 100 Israeli tanks have been stationed along the fence with Gaza, with additional barricades to come.

Hecht said no decision has been made yet about a possible ground invasion of the strip. “We are preparing for a ground maneuver if it is decided,” he said.

Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have triggered a mass displacement that is piling pressure on Egypt to open its border with the strip to allow refugees to flee. The White House said the U.S. is discussing with Israel and Egypt options for granting safe passage to Egypt for civilians in Gaza.

An estimated 500 to 600 U.S. citizens live in the Gaza Strip, and some are looking for safe passage out, including over the border into Egypt, the senior U.S. official said.

The Israeli military has urged Palestinians in Gaza to leave via the border crossing with Egypt, but they can’t cross without a special permit.

With Israel’s military having ordered a total siege on Gaza, supplies of food, fuel and water are no longer reaching the enclave, leaving Gazans in the dark with thinning supplies as explosions rock their buildings at night. Gaza’s only power plant ran out of fuel earlier this week.

Grim scenes were emerging from Gaza’s residential neighborhoods, with some people saying that the bombing by the Israeli Air Force appeared to be indiscriminate. Entire communities were sorting through rubble on Thursday, with some intersections completely blocked and thick dust hanging in the air.

“They’re bombing homes with people inside,” said 24-year-old Malak Al Sous, who had packed and was planning to flee her home. She was without electricity, water and internet for two days. “Everything is destroyed,” she said.

Earlier this week, Mahdi Eljamal, a 37-year-old engineer, and his wife went to Al Nasr hospital to take cover, after a neighbor had received a phone call from an Israeli number warning him that buildings in his neighborhood would be destroyed within half an hour. People around him started screaming, trying to evacuate as quickly as they could.

“We have been living in fear for six days now,” Eljamal said. “The bombing never stops.”

Israeli military officials say they only target sites that intelligence shows are used by Gaza militants.

At Gaza City’s largest medical complex, Al Shifa Hospital, patients including crying children packed the halls. Some had wounds that were hastily bandaged. Limited electricity supplies were being allocated to operations rooms. Ambulances arrived nonstop carrying the wounded and deceased.

The International Committee of the Red Cross warned Thursday that as Gaza loses power, newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen would be at risk and that families were having trouble accessing clean water.

As of Thursday, 12 employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees have been killed since the offensive began over the weekend, the agency said. The Palestinian Red Crescent said four of its medics were killed after Israeli forces struck an ambulance in the northern Gaza Strip.

Israel’s military campaign is unfolding against a brutal backdrop in the country’s south, where authorities are retrieving hundreds of bodies and documenting communities that were targeted by Hamas. Col. (Res) Golan Vach, who headed the recovery of the Israeli dead, said he saw decapitated soldiers, dozens of young people’s bodies burned, women mutilated and babies without heads.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
The October Horror Is Something New,2023-10-12T22:27:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Peggy Noonan'],"We are again in a new place. What has happened in Israel the past week is different. I have spent much of my life as you have, hearing regular reports of fighting in the Mideast, so when news broke last Saturday of what was happening near Gaza my mind started to process it as a continuation of the past. Within hours, as the facts of the October horror began to emerge, I understood no, wait, this is a new thing. And I felt a foreboding.

We must start with what was done. Terrorists calling themselves a resistance movement passed over the border from Gaza and murdered little children; they took infants hostage as they screamed. They murdered old women, tormented and raped young women, targeted an overnight music festival and murdered the unarmed young people in cold blood or mowed them down as they ran screaming. They murdered whole families as they begged for their lives; they burned people alive; they decapitated babies.

There is no cause on earth that justifies what these murderers did. There is no historical grievance that excuses or “gives greater context” to their actions. Spare me “this is the inevitable result when a people are long abused.” No, this is what happens when savages hold the day: They imperil the very idea of civilization. They killed a grandmother and uploaded pictures of her corpse to her

page. They cut an unborn child from a mother’s body and murdered both.

This wasn’t “soldiers morally brutalized by war who, in a frenzy, butchered people.” Butchering people was the aim. It is what they set out to do. This wasn’t cruelty as an offshoot; it was cruelty as an intention.

This sadism was strategic. It’s meant to force something.

I have been troubled by, angered by, Israel for years—expanding settlements, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s high-handedness with American political leaders, his party’s embrace of an ignorant populist nationalism. I feel no shame at this and am certain I am right. But you can’t see what we have seen this week and not feel—how to put it?—a reawakened sense of affiliation with this suffering people, a sympathy reborn; as an American Catholic I am experiencing it as a renewed sense of loyalty to kin. And if you can’t feel any of these things, or appreciate how they might be justified, and if you instead use this occasion to say Israel deserves it as the price of its sins—sorry, wrong word, they don’t even know what sin is—then you are a walking, talking moral void.

I’m not going to dwell on The Squad, or the Ivy League student groups that declared support for Hamas. Except to say, about the latter, we seem to be raising a generation whose most privileged and educated members appear to be incapable of making moral distinctions. They made me think of the Oxford Union vow, in 1933, not to fight for king and country: High-class dopes always get it wrong. In Oxford’s defense, when World War II came many of them did their part. These guys are apparently upset they might not get jobs on Wall Street. What cold little clowns.

I will only quickly say of Mr. Netanyahu that I think of him as I thought of Boris Johnson, a bad man who is bad because he thinks politics now is beyond bad and good; you don’t even have to make a choice, there’s nothing in being “good”; it’s all about you and your quest for power and greatness. It never occurs to them not to be selfish because the self is all. This is how he divided his country over domestic questions, alienated his armed forces, stigmatized functioning establishments, and left his country vulnerable to the epic intelligence and security failure that is now his legacy.

“Nothing is the same in Israel as it was two days ago,” read a Monday Haaretz headline on a column by Linda Dyan. “Everyone trusted that the state would protect us,” she wrote. Everyone thought Israel was as strong as in the past. But its enemies saw it wasn’t.

I am worried for Israel. Here I speak of my fears.

It is impossible to me the savagery was not the strategy. The sadism the terrorists delivered was intended to do something, elicit a particular response.

What? We can’t be sure, but there are many possibilities. Maybe the terrorists and Iran, their masters, want to leave Israel with no choice but to go at Hamas by pummeling, then taking and occupying Gaza. That will be a terrible battle—a wracking and, in the end, a hand-to-hand, door-to-door fight. Maybe the point is to bleed Israel there, focus it there, and allow the world in coming weeks and months to absorb the gruesome pictures that will surely follow, as innocent people, including children, are among the collateral casualties. Almost half the population of Gaza is under 18.

Maybe they hope to see Israel preoccupied in Gaza while they open second and third fronts, with Hezbollah moving in from Lebanon, or the West Bank suddenly engaged.

Here is what I hope: that Israel be deliberative, farsighted, cautious. If that means slow, then slow.

Caution isn’t rousing or bold, and it certainly isn’t satisfying. It doesn’t bestow on the grieving any sense of justice. But the famously dangerous neighborhood has never been more so, and one senses Israel’s enemies think this is their moment. Israel must make itself safer and move against Hamas without starting World War III.

The Israelis should reach out in every way, including diplomatically, in their grief. Is the peace deal with Saudi Arabia still gettable? Do everything to get it. Might Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman enjoy saving them? Let him.

They must look to internal stability and security—fortify, build up defense positions, firm up security and intelligence on the borders and internally. Replenish arms and ammunition, continue making arms available to the people. Israelis have to begin feeling secure in their homes again. Do everything possible to proceed in attempting a return of the hostages. Be frank about this.

Continue to unmuddy the moral waters. What Hamas did was stone evil. Tell the world and show the world, over and over.

For now they must bury the dead and mourn. But something else. There is something Israel has shown to a heroic degree each day since that terrible Saturday morning.

It has led with its heart.

On a Zoom call this week a man living with his family in Israel told Americans a story. One of the young women killed at the rave was from Brazil. Her mother and sister flew in for the funeral. But someone on WhatsApp sent out word, a fear that no one else would be there to mourn. So the man’s teenage son jumped in his car and drove, and he had to stop 25 minutes from the site, traffic at a standstill, because . . . 7,000 or 8,000 people showed up, having heard that the family might be alone. My eyes filled as I heard it, and fill again as I write.

What a people. Hearts like that can awe and move the minds of the world.

Beyond the Instagram War,2023-10-12T21:19:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Emma Osman'],"‘Never Again Is Now.” “Now and Always, We Stand With the People of Israel.” “Am Yisrael Chai.” So reads my Instagram feed since Hamas’s brutal attacks on Israeli citizens Saturday.

With these social-media posts, friends who belong to my temple, classmates who attended my bat mitzvah, family members with whom I observe the High Holidays all declare their solidarity with the state of Israel.

But as I keep scrolling and exit my personal bubble, I see a wider world on Instagram. Some posts express support for the Jewish people and the state of Israel. Others attempt to furnish some kind of “context.” A college acquaintance uses a graphic to illustrate that “this has been the deadliest year in decades for Palestinians under the Occupation.” A Manhattan restaurateur reminds his followers of their “Responsibility to Listen to the Other Side.” After a furor, he apologized, deleted the post and wrote: “All I want is peace in the Middle East.” Another person posts differing opinions within hours, swayed by the comments on her feed. As I move further from my echo chamber, I see members of Hamas depicted as heroes fulfilling their duty rather than as terrorists descending on a music festival to brutalize and murder young people.

Members of my generation—I’m 24—grew up with social media and are accustomed to learning through these platforms. Many young people turn solely to social media for their daily news and information. As news outlets and our government become more divided, so have social-media platforms.

Now, we are watching a war unfold on Instagram. We are seeing women raped and children slaughtered right on our feeds. And yet we are coming away with drastically different understandings.

As the platforms’ algorithms reinforce our views and mute opposing ideas, we risk losing sight of reality. Our feeds foster an environment in which the NYU Law Student Bar Association’s president posted that “the full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life” rests on the Israeli government. Thirty Harvard student groups “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” All while the leaders of many top universities fail to make public statements.

A moment of 9/11-like moral clarity has been transformed into a series of political statements scrolling on phone screens.

As the war grinds on in Israel and Gaza, many who post on social media will forget their brief stints of activism.

It’s time to look up from our screens.

Don’t Go Wobbly on Peace,2023-10-12T21:16:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Nadim Koteich'],"The economic ministers of Israel and the United Arab Emirates pose for a photo at the signing ceremony of a free trade deal in Dubai, May 31, 2022.

A new Middle East was dawning last week. Commercial flights were taking off between the Arabian peninsula and Israeli cities, goods were flowing from Israel to ports along the Gulf, entrepreneurs in Dubai and Tel Aviv were trading ideas, and a historic normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel was in the works. Then, on Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists stormed into Israel, endangering the nation and region at large.

Though Hamas launched the assault, Iran aided it as part of a larger strategy to sabotage nascent peace initiatives between Israel and Arab countries. This wouldn’t be the first time the regime was implicated in such efforts; in the mid-1990s, Tehran was suspected of assisting several suicide bombings in Israel. This period of instability also saw the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, the quintessential symbol of peace in his era.

In recent weeks Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Muslim countries “betting on peace are betting on a losing horse.” President Ebrahim Raisi labeled normalization efforts “reactionary and regressive.” After the weekend’s horror, Mr. Raisi reportedly congratulated Hamas leadership on the group’s “victory.”

The message among regional leaders must be clear: Now isn’t the time to go wobbly on peace. Hamas and its allies have made that difficult by poisoning the climate for normalization. Arab media makes matters worse by not accurately reporting on the conditions in Gaza, which could have been a model of social and economic progress before Hamas turned it to ruin.

Oversimplified arguments for Arab resistance and victimization have shaken even the most peace-oriented nations in the region. Initial responses, including from old peace partners like Egypt and Jordan, fell short of addressing the gravity of the civilian attacks. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the few regional actors to condemn Hamas.

Israel will likely have to use extreme military force to re-establish its deterrent power. This presents a quandary: Israel can’t pursue peace while feeling vulnerable—yet the actions required to regain strength and security could further undermine the political foundations for peace. The situation is more difficult with Benjamin Netanyahu at the helm, whose tenure as prime minister—from oversight of expanded settlements to lethal operations in Gaza—has made a two-state solution increasingly unlikely.

A perfect storm is brewing that threatens to set the region back to 1967. That year Mideast leaders gathered for the Arab League Summit in Khartoum, Sudan, where they agreed to no peace with Israel, no recognition and no negotiations. This resolution, known as the “Three Nos,” shaped the Arab world’s mind-set toward Jerusalem for decades.

The geopolitical landscape has recently undergone a seismic shift. The Three Nos have been morphing into Three Yeses: peace, recognition and cooperation. The region has engaged in more-proactive engagement thanks to the Abraham Accords, which has catalyzed direct diplomacy and unlocked untapped commercial and trade avenues, including collaboration in such sectors as space, artificial intelligence and security. Hamas and Iran saw this as a threat and reverted to their old playbook of terrorism and grievance.

While Palestinians have a legitimate claim to statehood, their success will rest on their ability to overhaul their national agenda. This means abandoning corrupt governance in the West Bank and, most important, renouncing extremism in Gaza. The onus for achieving lasting peace—especially in light of past support from the U.S. and Arab nations—primarily lies with the Palestinians themselves.

The Middle East can embrace this new era of yes or revert to a past of no. While Washington can assist, only regional leaders fortified by moral courage can accomplish sustainable peace. Demand peace today, enforce it tomorrow, and sustain it always. Anyone who chooses otherwise should be left behind.

Simchat Torah and the Jewish Love of Life,2023-10-12T20:38:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Meir Soloveichik'],"Fifty years after the Yom Kippur War, Israelis face an attack launched on another holiday—Simchat Torah, which brings the festival season to a close. As in 1973, Israel’s enemies took advantage of Israeli soldiers celebrating with their families at home. As in 1973, the war shattered a feeling of complacency in the Jewish state—five decades ago because of the stunning success of the Six Day War; today because of the nation’s remarkable missile-defense system, the Iron Dome.

Amid the striking similarities, there is an important difference. In 1973, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat launched his war to strengthen his negotiating hand as he pursued an elaborate geopolitical strategy that entailed an alliance with the U.S., detachment from the Soviets, and eventually peace with Israel.

Hamas seeks the death of every Jew, a goal stated explicitly in its charter, which asserts as a religious obligation: “The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews . . ., when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say, ‘Oh Muslims, Oh Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.’ ” That sentiment drove Hamas’s terrorists as they hunted down, tortured and murdered soldiers and civilians, elderly and children.

The juxtaposition of Jewish celebration and war underlines the conflict’s civilizational import. Simchat Torah, the “Joy of the Law,” marks the year’s completion of the Torah, the five books of Moses, which is read aloud weekly in synagogue. Near the end of Deuteronomy, in a passage read late in the cycle, is one of Moses’ last exhortations: “Therefore choose life, so that thou and thy children may live.”

The verse captures Jewish history, including the story of modern Israel. Among the horrific images of massacres and abductions, I was struck by a video of an Israeli reservist, called up to army service, watching via Zoom the circumcision of his 8-day-old son. He pronounced the traditional liturgy over his phone, concluding with one of the most poignant blessings in Jewish life: “Blessed art thou, Lord our God, . . . who has kept us alive, allowed us to endure, and allowed us to reach this moment.”

The video epitomizes what is at stake. Israel’s culture cherishes life, while Hamas and its allies worship death. Years ago Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah proclaimed: “We have discovered how to hit the Jews where they are the most vulnerable. The Jews love life, so that is what we shall take away from them. We are going to win, because they love life and we love death.” Hamas official Ali Baraka sounded this same note this week, adding: “We consider our dead to be martyrs. The thing any Palestinian desires the most is to be martyred for the sake of Allah, defending his land.”

Jews do love life, especially because of the fragility of our history. We celebrate on Simchat Torah the completion of the Torah and the opportunity to begin it again, seeing in the continuing cycle a symbol of our people’s eternity. The Jew, Tolstoy reflected, “has brought down from heaven the everlasting fire and has illuminated with it the entire world. . . . He whom neither slaughter nor torture of thousands of years could destroy, he whom neither sword nor inquisition was able to wipe off the face of the earth, . . . he who has been for so long the guardian of prophecy, and who transmitted it to the rest of the world—such a nation cannot be destroyed. The Jew is as everlasting as is eternity itself.”

Anti-Semites, from those murdering children on the streets of Israel to those celebrating Hamas on the streets of New York, are driven by jealousy and hatred of a people that doesn’t die. They are convinced they will finally succeed in destroying the Jews.

They will fail, thanks to the fortitude of the Jewish state and the providential nature of Jewish history.

For many years after Yom Kippur in 1973, Jews in Israel marking Judaism’s holiest day remembered where they were when the siren sounded, the reserves were called up, and loved ones bid goodbye to soldiers, some of whom they never saw again. Countless Jews will now mark every year the completion of the Law of Moses and remember the Simchat Torah of 2023. The celebration will be rendered more profound in the knowledge that the story of the Jewish people continues, that its enemies have failed again, that the cycle of the Torah will begin once more, and that there will be many Jewish babies’ births celebrated in the year to come.

A Middle East Wake-Up Call,2023-10-12T16:29:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Walter Russell Mead'],"Almost a week after Hamas fanatics bent on murder slipped across the borders of Gaza, the world is still struggling to process the shock. It will be months or perhaps years before the full consequences of this attack can finally be assessed, and we do not know if the war in Gaza will spread across the Middle East and possibly beyond.

But three consequences of the attack can already be discerned. First, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been seriously and maybe irrevocably wounded. Mr. Netanyahu has argued that he was the indispensable man who alone had the stature and vision to guide a small nation in a rough world—even if the price of his continued leadership involved bringing an unruly and chaotic coalition to power and a year of all-consuming domestic political strife. That seems harder to justify now.

Similarly, the belief among some on the Israeli right that Israel was strong enough and the Palestinians were isolated enough so that expanding settlements on the West Bank entailed no real risks or costs has been exposed as a dangerous delusion. The decision to plunge Israel into a year of turmoil over judicial-reform proposals also looks more questionable in light of the Hamas attacks.

Israel needs a sober government. Too many of the parties in the current coalition are too poorly led, impulsive and prone to wishful thinking to provide the leadership an embattled nation needs. Wednesday’s announcement of a wartime freeze on controversial legislation and a unity government with an experienced war cabinet will help Israel focus on the tasks at hand, but a serious political reckoning lies ahead.

Second, while the Israeli right has lost ground, the cause of the Palestinians has suffered even more. After these attacks, the two-state solution is sick, and the one-state solution is dead.

The time may come when the establishment of an independent Palestinian state returns to the agenda, but I see no prospect that any Israeli government of any party would embrace this cause now. The danger that Hamas-linked genocidaires would take over is too real to make the idea acceptable to Israelis. Israeli politicians must make the survival of Israel the supreme goal of their policies. Thanks to Hamas, the goal of Palestinian independence is further off than ever.

The idea of combining the two peoples into a single state is even more absurd. No sane person can imagine that Israelis would accept millions (or even tens of thousands) of Hamas supporters as fellow citizens of a common state. No serious person would ask them to.

Third, the ability of the Muslim Brotherhood (of which Hamas is a member) to advance democracy in the Arab world has sustained a staggering, perhaps fatal blow. Until the brotherhood unambiguously repudiates Hamas, its credibility as a stabilizing democratic force will collapse. Western governments and nongovernmental organizations will have to review their links with Hamas-supporting groups, and Western pressure for democratization in the Arab world will weaken even further.

If some things have become clear in the wake of the attacks, important questions remain. The most immediate and urgent concern the possible spread of the war and the role of Iran. The Iranian proxy Hezbollah has launched rockets into Israel and, with an arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets and missiles at its disposal, could significantly widen the conflict. The Iranian regime has poured money into Hamas and provided technical training, weapons and political cover without which attacks on this scale couldn’t have happened.

Washington’s first priority, correctly, has been to reduce the chance of escalation by moving forces into the region and warning Iran and Hezbollah to keep their distance. “Don’t,” was President Biden’s advice for any country or armed group thinking of attacking Israel during this crisis.

For Israel, the priority is to deal directly with Hamas. But soon both Washington and Jerusalem must develop a response to Iran’s undoubted role as funder and sponsor of these attacks. Lawyerly quibbles about the exact details of Iran’s involvement can’t obscure the reality that its role was sufficient to demand a response. If the U.S. and Israel are, in effect, deterred by their fears of Iranian retaliation from inflicting this price, Iran has achieved its long-sought hegemonic position in the Middle East even without the nuclear weapons it will soon possess. It can attack Israel without being punished. It will do so again. Israel and the U.S. must either act or accept this new reality.

The Biden administration has a historic choice to make. Strategic passivity in the face of Iran’s relentless and remorseless rise to regional power was the central plank of President Obama’s Middle East policy and has largely guided policy in the Biden years. The Biden administration hoped that U.S. security guarantees to Israel and Saudi Arabia could maintain a regional balance in the face of growing Iranian power. The Hamas attacks were intended to frustrate this initiative. Iran is determined to destroy the Jewish state and to banish American power from a region that remains vital to the peace and prosperity of the world. Mr. Biden must decide whether he will stand his ground or cede regional leadership to a hostile Iran.

Finally, there is the question of whether American and Western opinion will awaken to the new state of the world. In a horrible way, the descent of death-dealing paragliders into a peaceful music festival in Israel is an apt symbol of our times. The post-Cold War trance of the West, reaping peace dividends, celebrating flower power, and generally living as if utopia had already arrived, has left us mentally and morally disarmed. The revisionist powers that recognize no moral limits on their power as they seek to overturn the existing world system in an ocean of blood are descending onto our festival of folly like the hell-bound paragliders of Hamas. We cannot and should not respond with irrational panic and random outbursts of violence. We must soberly and deliberately address a mortal danger to everything we hold dear—and we must at long last wake up.

Hamas Invasion Rewrites Rules in Middle East,2023-10-11T23:43:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Yaroslav Trofimov'],"DUBAI—Saturday’s attack on Israel by Hamas militants, who killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped many others back to the Gaza Strip, has upended fundamental assumptions about the Middle East.

Now, as Israel, its enemies and its main partner, the U.S., respond to these shocking events, the new—and untested—rules of the game risk turning the bloody confrontation between Israel and Hamas into a much wider war.

Israel’s expected land operation against Hamas in Gaza, and the reaction to it by Iran and its group of allied Islamist militias around the region, could determine the new balance of power in the Middle East and the new set of understandings about the region’s future.

“Hamas inflicted this surprise, devastating attack because it wanted to change the equation, not just between Hamas and Israel, but also between Israel and the axis of Iranian supporters and Iranian proxies,” said reserve Brig. Gen. Yossi Kuperwasser, a former head of research for Israeli military intelligence. “Israel now wants to change the equation, too, but in the other direction—if we kick Hamas out of Gaza.”

Should Israel manage to eliminate Hamas as Gaza’s dominant force, it would reverse one critical aspect of the fallout from Saturday’s events: the crumbling of the long-cultivated perception of Israel’s superior military and intelligence prowess. After swiftly breaching costly Israeli border fortifications and overrunning military bases, Hamas gunmen went on a killing spree—causing the worst loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust.

The attack destroyed another assumption, long cultivated by Hamas’s backers such as Turkey and Qatar, and accepted by many in the West and even inside parts of the Israeli establishment: that the Islamist group had somehow moderated its original ideology, which seeks the elimination of any Jewish presence between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean.

Aiming to put a new gloss on its goals, Hamas in 2017 even issued a policy statement that said that its conflict is with “the Zionist project” rather than Jews, and implied acceptance of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza—though still rejecting Israel’s right to exist.

The horrors of the Hamas assault have also punctured the notion, long championed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that Palestinian aspirations could be reduced to a manageable nuisance, and that the occupation could persist, even as Israel pursues new relationships in the Arab world.

“The Netanyahu doctrine that you can ignore the Palestinians without paying a price has been shattered,” said Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israel and Palestine at the International Crisis Group. “It turns out that, no matter how much economic and military and diplomatic power you have, your entire country can ground to a halt.”

More Israeli citizens were killed Saturday than during the entire Second Intifada of 2000-2005, she said.

The corollary of this new reality is that the U.S. is having to return to the Middle East, reversing the trend of three consecutive administrations that had tried to pivot away and focus on other global challenges such as China and, since last year’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia.

The Biden administration has already dispatched two carrier groups to the Eastern Mediterranean, as part of an effort to deter Iran and its Lebanese protégé, Hezbollah, from joining the conflict and potentially sparking a regional war that could also involve Iran and nations in the Persian Gulf. Washington is also rushing weapons to Israel.

“It’s a re-engagement. It turns out that our partners in the region are still heavily dependent on the security umbrella that the U.S. continues to provide,” said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “They still look to us as the primary security partner of choice—not at China, and certainly not at Russia. And when a crisis like this emerges, we are on the speed dial.”

Israel’s enemies were celebrating the surprising weakness displayed by the country’s military and intelligence services on Saturday. Israel’s high-tech border surveillance system around Gaza was knocked down with cheap drones, senior officers were killed at captured Israeli military bases and it took several hours for Israeli forces to start driving back Hamas—time that the Palestinian gunmen used to murder or kidnap defenseless civilians.

“The blow of Saturday, Oct. 7, cannot be recovered from. You have brought this calamity upon yourselves,” Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed Israelis in a gloating Hebrew-language post on X, a social-media platform formerly known as Twitter. To some Arab commentators, Hamas’s success indicated that Israel could indeed be militarily defeated and that the seemingly unrealistic goal of wiping out the Israeli state isn’t that far-fetched.

But despite Israeli officials describing Saturday’s events as the country’s Pearl Harbor, the damage to Israel’s actual military capabilities was limited. The country’s powerful air force is intact, and within hours started pummeling the Gaza Strip. Several hundred Gaza residents, including civilians, have been killed since then, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, and key infrastructure destroyed.

“It’s clear that the Israelis have underestimated Hamas, but now Hamas, Hezbollah and all the rest of the Iranian proxies stand a great risk of underestimating Israel,” said Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group intelligence and security consulting firm. “It’s still by far the strongest military in the region, and they’re now especially motivated to seek vengeance against a number of longtime adversaries.”

On Tuesday, President Biden said he expected the Israeli response to be “swift, decisive and overwhelming”—while also upholding the laws of war. Biden also compared Hamas’s actions to the “worst rampages” of Islamic State, in language seen by many in Israel as a green light to do in Gaza what the U.S.-led coalition had done to oust Islamic State from Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, in 2017.

Both cities were heavily damaged in sustained U.S. bombing campaigns and artillery barrages that caused numerous civilian casualties. Unlike Gaza, however, Mosul and Raqqa weren’t blockaded, and many Iraqi and Syrian civilians managed to escape to safety.

Israel’s expected ground campaign to eradicate Hamas, with the potential for the high casualties inherent in urban combat, would test the degree to which Iran and Hezbollah are committed to the Palestinian group—and the Palestinian cause.

In past conflagrations over Gaza, Hezbollah stayed largely on the sidelines, observing the rules of mutual deterrence agreed after the 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The Lebanese group possesses an arsenal of Iranian-supplied precision missiles that could inflict significant damage to Israel’s vital infrastructure and military facilities.

“At a very strategic level, Hezbollah and Iran are not very interested, as yet, to jump into this fight,” said Emile Hokayem, a senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “The fundamental calculus for Iran still holds: Hezbollah is such a unique and powerful instrument of its security policy that it’s not going to waste it on this war. Hezbollah is to be used and deployed when the regime in Iran, its very existence, is threatened.”

So far, Hezbollah has engaged in limited skirmishes along the border. Its fighters hit an Israeli armored personnel carrier with antitank missiles on Wednesday. Such clashes raise the risk of an unintended conflagration, said Nadav Pollak, a former analyst for the Israeli government who is now a lecturer on Middle East affairs at Reichman University in Israel.

“Since 2006, we have never been so close to another war with Hezbollah,” he said. “If God forbid, they fire an antitank missile and kill 10-15 soldiers at the border, Israel will have to reply or even initiate a war.”

One significant change since 2006 is Iran’s new doctrine of the “unification of the arenas” which seeks to improve coordination and joint actions of Tehran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iranian proxies in Iraq and Yemen, in their confrontation with Israel. An eviction of Hamas from Gaza would be a huge blow to that doctrine—one of the reasons why Tehran may decide to expand the conflict to maintain its regional influence.

“There is a very big risk that a war in Lebanon can morph into a regional conflict. I don’t think that Iran, Israel or Hezbollah want it. But they’ve locked themselves into positions where if one step is taken by one side, then the other side has to take a counter-step,” said Lebanese analyst Michael Young, a senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “There are no real clear offramps for this steady escalation toward the worst option.”

For now, such concerns are unlikely to deter Israel’s leadership. Hardly any voices, in the just-expanded government or in the Israeli opposition, oppose a sustained land operation to defeat Hamas. “The only game in town is getting rid of Hamas, and there is tons of political pressure to do that,” said Zonszein of the International Crisis Group. “The consensus is that Hamas cannot remain intact.”

Questions about who should govern Gaza’s two million people after that, and whether Israel is prepared to once again occupy the area, are for now set aside. “I don’t think anyone is thinking about the day after right now,” said Pollak. “Everyone knows one thing: Hamas has just launched the most horrible terror attacks in Israeli history, and we need to fight back, and, sorry to say, we need to kill as many of Hamas as we can.”

The bombardments following Saturday’s devastating attack by Hamas—which killed more than 1,200 Israelis—raised concerns about an escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, while skirmishes along Israel’s northern border threaten a regional expansion of the conflict.

At an event with Jewish community leaders Wednesday, President Biden called the Hamas attacks on Israel the “deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust” and a “campaign of pure cruelty.” He added, “It matters that Americans see what is happening. I have been doing this a long time—I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children.”

Hamas has denied that its militants beheaded children.

An administration official later said that the president was referring to what the Israeli government and soldiers have said. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday they could say with “relative confidence” that beheadings of children happened in Be’eri kibbutz near the Gaza Strip.

Israelis have been shocked at the intensity of the violence meted on civilians by the Hamas attacks. “They didn’t distinguish between anyone. Everything with a pulse, they massacred them,” said an organizer of the music festival close to Gaza where Hamas killed more than 250 revelers. “This is cruelty…It’s incomprehensible.”

The organizer, who was interviewed anonymously by search and rescue organization South First Responders, said he witnessed many children, young men and women and the elderly shot or hacked to death.

Israeli strikes have killed at least 1,200 Palestinians in Gaza since Saturday, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. Most of the strip’s more than two million residents have no way of fleeing the enclave, which is about twice the size of Washington, D.C., and has been all but sealed off from the world by Israel and Egypt for years.

With Israel’s military having ordered a total siege on Gaza, supplies of food, fuel and water are no longer reaching the enclave, leaving Gazans in the dark with thinning supplies as explosions rock their buildings at night. Gaza’s only power plant ran out of fuel on Tuesday, Gaza’s energy authority said.

Of the more than 260,000 people who have fled their homes, more than half are sheltering in schools run by a United Nations agency that serves Palestinian refugees, the U.N. said early Wednesday. Others are seeking shelter in hotels.

With military operations under way, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz, a former chief of staff of the Israeli military and defense minister, said they had formed a unity government to manage the country’s war with Palestinian militants.

Netanyahu and Gantz would join a small “war management cabinet” also including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, according to a joint statement issued Wednesday.

Netanyahu has come under domestic political pressure over the Hamas attacks, which caught the government, the military and intelligence services by surprise.

The Israeli military on Tuesday urged Palestinians in Gaza to leave via a border crossing with Egypt, but Palestinians can’t cross the border without a special permit. Israeli forces have bombed the crossing three times in recent days, leading to long disruptions at the border for those who have permission, according to local authorities, Egyptian officials and the U.N.

The mass displacement in Gaza is piling pressure on Egypt to open its border with the strip to allow refugees to flee, illustrating how the situation in Gaza and Israel threatens to spill over into a broader regional crisis. The White House said the U.S. is discussing with Israel and Egypt options for granting safe passage to Egypt for civilians living in Gaza.

“Civilians are not to blame for what Hamas has done,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. “They didn’t do anything wrong.”

Egypt’s military-backed government has tightened its restrictions on both Gaza and the neighboring North Sinai region in recent years, and has shown no indication that it will accept a tide of refugees.

In Gaza City’s al-Karama neighborhood, Ahmad Hassouna, a 42-year-old man wearing an orange T-shirt, a pair of glasses tucked into his collar, paused to catch his breath as he stepped over rubble in the street.

“We all came out, my sister, my brother, my mother and me. We were all here on the ground and we were all injured. We called for an ambulance and when it came, they struck the ambulance,” he said, describing how his family fled an airstrike the night before.

“Forget human rights, we don’t even have animal rights,” he said.

The Palestinian Red Crescent aid organization said later on Wednesday that Israeli forces had struck an ambulance in the northern Gaza Strip, killing three medics. The World Health Organization said it has documented 37 attacks on health facilities and ambulances which had killed six medics before Wednesday.

Nine employees of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees have been killed since the offensive began over the weekend, the agency said on Wednesday.

Israeli forces exchanged fire with Lebanon’s Hezbollah for a fourth consecutive day on Wednesday, dialing up fears that a second front could open up in the war if the Shiite Hezbollah movement chooses to enter the fray.

The Israeli military said an antitank missile from Lebanon was launched toward a military post near the village of Arab Al-Aramshe along the Lebanese border on Wednesday morning. Israel said it struck in Lebanese territory in response.

Hezbollah said it fired a missile at an Israeli military vehicle in retaliation for an Israeli attack that killed three members of the group on Monday. An Israeli military officer was also killed in the clashes.

The clashes with Hezbollah and with Palestinian armed groups in Lebanon have so far been limited in scope and within the broad rules of engagement understood by both sides, military analysts say.

If Hezbollah were to fully join the war, it could spell catastrophe for both Israel and Lebanon. The Iranian-backed group has a powerful militia of fighters who are battle-tested from the war in neighboring Syria and an arsenal of missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel.

Israeli officials have said that the offensive in Gaza would be larger and more severe than any in recent memory. It could be complicated by Hamas’s seizure of more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages who are being held in Gaza. At least 20 Americans in Israel are still missing after the Hamas attacks.

The Israeli Air Force said Wednesday that it launched more than 80 airstrikes that it said hit weapons stockpiles, bank branches used to fund Hamas and underground tunnels used by militants. The air force also said it struck high-rise buildings in Gaza.

Palestinian residents, medics and the U.N. said the strikes killed and injured civilians.

Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian surgeon stationed at Gaza City’s largest hospital, said an increasing number of children are among the wounded flooding into a hospital already full of injured people.

“This morning, we had a child, a beautiful young girl with really indescribable facial injuries, whose mother was a doctor at Shifa and who was killed when their home was targeted. Last night, a 10-year-old boy with devastating facial injuries, who was taken out of the rubble of his home,” he said.

“The situation continues to deteriorate,” he said.

“Several residential buildings in heavily populated areas were also targeted, resulting in casualties, including among the elderly, women, and children,” said the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The Israeli military has said that it has a reduced capacity for precision strikes because its forces are stretched thin.

An Egyptian official said the government is expecting a large number of Palestinians to attempt to cross the border soon, whether or not the Rafah crossing point is reopened. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi could face public pressure to open the border if that happens.

“Sisi is stuck here. Allow them in and avoid a public uproar or let them die to protect Sinai,” the official said.

The military offensive and siege are cutting back on Gaza’s already limited basic services, limiting supplies of running water and reducing supplies of electricity to three or four hours a day, according to the U.N.

The strikes also destroyed two of Gaza’s three main lines for telecommunications, leaving Gazans with little to no internet or mobile service.

Israel imposed a strict closure on Gaza in 2007 after Hamas seized control of the strip in a military takeover that followed their victory in a Palestinian parliamentary election a year earlier. The restrictions ended decades in which many Gazans worked in Israel and moved freely throughout the country following Israel’s 1967 occupation of the territory.

The enclave has been in a long-running humanitarian crisis ever since, as the closure devastated Gaza’s economy, which had once been integrated into Israel’s. A series of wars between Israel and Hamas has further devastated Gaza’s infrastructure.

The worsening situation in Gaza poses a challenge for the Israeli government. Netanyahu has promised a response to the Hamas attacks that he said would be remembered by Israel’s enemies for decades to come.

But any attempt to dislodge Hamas, with its thousands of fighters and network of underground tunnels, could result in a long and costly war of attrition. Even if Israel were to reoccupy Gaza, it isn’t clear who would take charge of the enclave in the aftermath.

“He’s got to do something that allows him to say that he’s made good on that. A huge number of Palestinians casualties may go some way to meeting that bar, but may somehow feel insufficient,” said Daniel Levy, president of the U.S./Middle East Project, a policy institute, and a onetime adviser to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.

The Israeli military said it is mobilizing more than 300,000 reservists ahead of an expected ground invasion of Gaza.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
U.S. Looks at Risks of Deeper Involvement With Israel’s War on Hamas,2023-10-12T00:53:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Vivian Salama'],"National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that no decisions have been made about U.S. assistance for recovering hostages.

WASHINGTON—As Israel hammers Gaza with retaliatory strikes following Hamas’s weekend attacks, Biden administration officials are deliberating what actions might trigger U.S. military involvement in what threatens to become a broader regional conflict.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken departed for Israel on Wednesday on a two-pronged mission to show U.S. support for Israel and rally regional allies to pressure Hamas to release the hostages its fighters took. A still undetermined number of Americans are believed to be among the dozens of hostages Hamas took in the attack that killed at least 1,200 Israelis and 22 American citizens, some of them dual citizens.

While the administration looks for a diplomatic breakthrough to end the fighting and secure safe passage for civilians in Gaza, it is mixing diplomacy with military muscle to try to keep the conflict from spreading and thereby forestall deeper U.S. involvement. The USS Gerald R. Ford, the first of two aircraft carriers the U.S. is deploying to the region, arrived in the Mediterranean near Israel this week, officials said, to deter Lebanon-based Hezbollah and other like-minded actors from joining in.

“We don’t want to see this conflict widen any more than it already has,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday. “Israel is focused, rightly, on Hamas. Opening up additional fronts for them, obviously, would be just a horrible scenario.”

Among the scenarios that could trigger the unleashing of U.S. firepower would be a large-scale incursion from the north by fighters from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group, U.S. officials said this week. So far, Hezbollah has traded sporadic fire with Israeli forces. A concerted offensive could strain Israeli forces, jeopardizing their ability to focus on what is expected to be a pounding ground battle to clear Hamas from Gaza. Additional clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank, where tensions were already high over the expansion of Israeli settlements, could further tax Israeli forces.

Evacuations of American citizens out of Israel or Gaza might also require U.S. military assistance given the fraught nature of any such operation, and the administration isn’t ruling out providing help for hostage rescues.

An estimated 500 to 600 U.S. citizens live in Gaza, and some are looking for safe passage out, including over the border into Egypt, a senior administration official said.

The administration has said that it doesn’t intend to send U.S. ground troops into Israel or Gaza to support the war. Kirby said Wednesday no decisions have been made about assistance for hostage recovery, pointing to the absence of any reliable information about their whereabouts or well-being.

American involvement, while intending to deter a wider conflict, also risks drawing the U.S. into another potentially long-term, bloody conflict, despite President Biden’s vow early in his administration to avoid future “forever wars” such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. While Biden and his top officials have spoken forcefully about U.S. commitment to Israel, the administration is reluctant to risk additional resources and lives in a new conflict.

Biden has firsthand experience in the risks of U.S. involvement in Middle East security. As vice president, he was part of Washington’s reluctant decision to conduct airstrikes in Syria and Iraq and provide support to Iraqi forces decimated by Islamic State’s 2014 blitzkrieg. Until then, the Obama administration had scaled back the U.S. presence in Iraq.

Another potential headache for the Biden administration would be mounting civilian casualties in Gaza. Biden said he drew a contrast between Hamas, with its attacks on civilians, and the restraint the U.S. and Israel exercise to minimize the deaths of noncombatants in a conversation Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“We uphold the laws of war—the law of war. It matters. There’s a difference,” Biden said.

Biden also spoke Wednesday with United Arab Emirates President Mohamed bin Zayed, about the need to keep others from exploiting the current conflict and to ensure humanitarian assistance, the White House said.

Blinken, as he left the U.S. Wednesday, said he is confident Israel would take “all the precautions” on any military operations in Gaza.

But a number of humanitarian organizations, including the Palestine Red Crescent Society, on Wednesday reported casualties among their workers. The World Health Organization in a briefing Tuesday said that it had documented 37 attacks on health facilities and ambulances that had killed six medics.

Nine employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees have been killed since the offensive began over the weekend, the agency said on Wednesday.

Though Blinken’s official schedule, as of Wednesday, has him traveling to Israel and then Jordan, U.S. officials said the trip might be prolonged to draft support from other allies.

With waves of Gazans attempting to flee, U.S. officials said they are in discussions with the government in Egypt to open up the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Cairo had been reluctant to open the border crossing and allow in swarms of Gazans, according to U.S. and Middle Eastern officials.

Discussions are under way, including between Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, about what Cairo might be willing to do.

Egypt has long-running concerns about militant activity in the Sinai Peninsula, which abuts Gaza and was once hotly contested in the country’s own wars with Israel. While Cairo used its leverage with Hamas fighters to help the U.S. broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in 2021, it is wary of the militant group and has sealed its borders with Gaza to prevent fighters from infiltrating Sinai.

Other U.S. partners that have lines to Hamas include Qatar and Turkey. Blinken has made several calls to his counterparts in both countries seeking their assistance in ensuring a safe release of hostages.

The new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. (Not Charles Q. Brown or C.Q. Brown.)

Our Washington bureau checked with his staff, and while his full name is Charles Quinton Brown Jr., it turns out that CQ Brown Jr. is the name he strongly prefers. In almost all cases, we go by the name that an individual prefers and uses consistently.

Some grammarians recoil at the use of initials without periods, but we go along with it—if, as stated, the person consistently does so.

And yes, as journalists, this case was a tough one to swallow. As any newspaper vet or journalism student knows, CQ looks like a copy-editing note that mistakenly found its way into an article. CQ is the notation that has long been used by editors, for internal use only, to mean the spelling or fact has been checked and is correct (remember it as “Correct as Quoted”).

So in this case, you might say that CQ is CQ’d.

Guidance for X/Twitter posts

Many of you have heard about the elimination of story headlines on X (formerly Twitter) posts. Here’s guidance, from Patrick Hedlund and his social team, for writing social language in this new environment.

Our longstanding instructions have been to not rely on headlines to get the full point of the story across. To wit:

Above all, share language should be able to stand and be understood on its own…. An article’s lede, nut graf and web summary are good places to look for inspiration. For general news stories, a trimmed-down version of the lede should suffice for social language.

In this sense, nothing has changed. Remember to include essential names, actions, etc., in your social language—the same way we would in headlines. This will not only help with clarity, but could help users searching for the same keywords within X. Another note from our earlier guidance:

[W]e should always go with something that more closely resembles the headline or summary than risk plugging in additional details that could muddy the point or confuse the reader.

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

And a reminder that social language should be written in complete sentences, in the past tense. If a story’s headline is descriptive enough to get the main point(s) across, then adapt that using the complete-sentence, past-tense rule.

X users can still click on the teaser image below the social language and navigate to the article page, but it doesn’t hurt to prompt them. Something to the effect of “Read the full story below.” Also, one way to ensure that people realize there is a clickable article accompanying the post is to add the URL twice. (One of the links will be replaced by the teaser image, while the other will show as a URL.)

The teaser image in X posts is now that much more important without headlines, so also remember to choose those wisely and for maximum visual impact.

Finally, be transparent with readers when sharing opinions, essays or first-person accounts. You can do this by tagging the author or primary account (@WSJOpinion, for example) or otherwise making it clear in the share language that the link you’re pointing to isn’t a straight news article.

Nonprofits and not-for-profit

We have updated the stylebook entry on nonprofits/not-for-profit.

In general, refer to tax-exempt organizations as nonprofits. The IRS and tax scholars typically use this term—and only this term—to refer to any of more than two dozen types of tax-exempt organizations allowed under Section 501(c) of the federal tax code.

The most prominent type of nonprofit is the 501(c)(3) charity, which includes many colleges, hospitals and museums, and donations to them are tax deductible. Another common type is the 501(c)(4), which includes the Sierra Club, the National Rifle Association and Planned Parenthood Action Fund. They are allowed to be more politically active, and contributions to them are not tax deductible.

The term not-for-profit is far less common and often more imprecise, although it may be used in some state laws.

Rulings & reminders

Be sure to uppercase God when referring to a single deity. Thus, the phrase “Oh, my God!” not “Oh, my god!” As the stylebook notes, lowercase when referring to gods and goddesses or in phrases that aren’t about God, such as god-awful and godsend.

The stylebook notes that Palestinian territories, not Palestine or the state of Palestine, is the term we use for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, since they don’t constitute a fully independent, unified state.

People can feel nauseated (as with motion sickness), not nauseous, even though the latter is how many of us speak. As the stylebook says, nauseous means causing nausea, and nauseated means being victimized by nausea. The rough sea is nauseous; the sailor was nauseated by it.

A thought on fraught: We try to avoid the word on its own as an adjective (as in: “a situation is fraught”), which is more of a British English usage. More commonly, something is said to be fraught with something else, such as fraught with danger.

The F-35 has a range of so-called stealth modes that restrict its visibility to radar and other detection. The Marines haven’t commented on what mission the jet—one of two on a sortie—was performing.

Answers

He is a player whom the Jets acquired. (The who/whom grammar trick is to use who if the name can be replaced by the pronoun he, and whom if it can be replaced by a him. In this case, the Jets acquired him, so we use whom.) A nitpick, but the word range—used twice here with two different meanings—might cause a moment of confusion. To rein in, as with a horse, of course. If he or she doesn’t. Our stylebook says the “singular they” (or their) still isn’t good grammar but is acceptable in specific reference to someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns. Or start the sentence off as a plural: If buyers have the additional cash…. A twofer: As discussed before, use a possessive before a gerund such as burying; and miles aren’t experienced as one complete mile at a time (so we use less rather than fewer). Thus: Both proposals would likely result in PG&E’s burying far less than 10,000 miles in total.

"Blaming Israel for Hamas Attacks Sparks Backlash Across U.S., Exposing Deep Rifts",2023-10-11T21:57:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Douglas Belkin', 'Lindsay Ellis']","Across U.S. universities, workplaces and halls of power, a swift backlash is meeting those who denounce Israel in the wake of Hamas’s deadly attack on Saturday.

On social media and beyond, some groups and individuals sympathetic to the Palestinian cause effectively placed blame for the attack on Israel, alleging that the nation’s policies have left Palestinians little choice but to lash out with violence. Some of that commentary came over the weekend, as reports of atrocities committed by Hamas were beginning to emerge.

Many of those statements have since been met with fierce resistance from a variety of voices, including Jewish groups and university heads. Some corporate leaders have also entered the fray, with some threatening not to hire students who blamed Israel for the attack.

That pushback has prompted some progressive politicians and left-leaning student organizations to walk back statements blaming the Jewish state for the violence that began over the weekend or remove their names from petitions condemning Israel.

The tension has ensnared the likes of Harvard President Claudine Gay, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and college students who faulted Israel for creating the conditions that they said led to the attacks.

On Tuesday, the law firm Winston & Strawn rescinded a job offer to a summer associate studying at the New York University School of Law after the student wrote in a newsletter that “Israel bears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life.”

“These comments profoundly conflict with Winston & Strawn’s values as a firm,” the company wrote in a statement. “Accordingly, the Firm has rescinded the law student’s offer of employment.”

The fallout highlights the deep rift between progressive Democrats, who have a strong voice on many college campuses, and moderate Democrats and Republicans over Israel and especially the treatment of Palestinians. The U.S. has long backed Israel with military aid and diplomatic support, but in recent years, pockets of the left have grown increasingly critical of Israel, likening it in some instances to an apartheid state for failing to give Palestinians full rights. The rising rhetoric has accompanied an uptick in antisemitism reports on college campuses in recent years.

On Saturday morning, as the details of the attack were only starting to emerge, campus groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine said Israel was to blame because its policies in Gaza were too restrictive.

The Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee and more than 30 other student groups signed a statement last weekend saying that Israel’s “apartheid regime is the only one to blame” for the violence.

Around the same time, Harvard President Gay issued a memo saying she was “heartbroken by the death and destruction” caused by the surprise Hamas attack on Saturday and Israel’s retaliation against Gaza.

Shortly thereafter, former Harvard President Larry Summers criticized Gay for failing to condemn Hamas.

On Tuesday, at least 17 Harvard student organizations, including Harvard Hillel, 500 faculty and staff members and more than 3,000 alumni and students signed a statement calling the Palestine Solidarity Committee statement “completely wrong and deeply offensive.”

Gay on Tuesday amended her statements about the attacks amid growing pressure.

“As the events of recent days continue to reverberate, let there be no doubt that I condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas,” Gay wrote. “Such inhumanity is abhorrent, whatever one’s individual views of the origins of long standing conflicts in the region.”

Several groups withdrew their support for the letter this week, including the school’s Islamic Society and Nepali Student Association. By Wednesday, all of the signatories of the letter were removed and a note attached at the bottom of the letter said they had been “concealed” for student safety.

Alex Morey, director of campus rights advocacy at Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said universities stepped up their commentary on political issues during the pandemic and following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. The engagement shifted expectations, said Morey, and has left schools “trapped…in a cycle of having to weigh in on everything and if they don’t, that failure to say something is saying something.”

Meanwhile, companies, which have a long history of scouring job candidates’ online personas for racist and other red-flag comments, have in recent days shown an unwillingness to put up with sentiment casting blame toward Israel.

Bill Ackman, a prominent hedge-fund manager, said Tuesday on social-media platform X that CEOs have been asking for the names of students involved with the organizations who signed the letter that circulated around Harvard to ensure “that none of us inadvertently hire any of their members.” Other CEOs, including Jonathan Neman of

, said online that he also wanted to know, so that he wouldn’t hire them

Ackman, who has given roughly $50 million to Harvard over the years, said he has since heard from more executives, other significant Harvard donors and parents of Harvard students thanking him for speaking out.

“When you’re hiring someone, among the issues that are critically important are their character, their judgments and how they care about their fellow human beings. If they support terrorists, I don’t know what company would want them,” he said in an interview. Ackman, who has long been active on X, formerly known as Twitter, said his tweet was his most-liked ever.

The Anti-Defamation League Wednesday urged CEOs of Fortune 500 companies to sign its “Workplace Pledge to Fight Antisemitism,” promising to support Jewish employees and use workplace media platforms to condemn antisemitic acts.

In recent years, many young professionals and job seekers have become more highly attuned to employers’ engagement on social and political issues. Some, for instance, called for a broad corporate response to the murder of Floyd in 2020. In a Gallup survey last year, 59% of young professionals said businesses should take a public stance on current events. That share was lower among older generations, and as low as 41% for workers between the ages of 45 and 59.

Many companies have stayed out of the discussion of Israel and Hamas. Some, including Microsoft, opted to put out internal notes to employees instead of making public pronouncements like they did when Russia attacked Ukraine, according to one communication strategist who advises corporate clients.

Elected officials who in the past have voiced criticism of Israel have moved to guard themselves against association with activists who have called for the nation’s destruction.

On Sunday, some of the hundreds of participants at a rally promoted by the Democratic Socialists of America in New York City’s Times Square blamed Israel for the attack. The group posted on social media that the events “are a direct result of Israel’s apartheid regime—a regime that receives billions in funding from the United States.”

Ocasio-Cortez has been associated with the DSA. On Tuesday, two days after the rally and after she had been called out on social media, she distanced herself from the event.

“It should not be hard to shut down hatred and antisemitism where we see it,” she said.

If We Had to Be Governed by the Harvard Faculty...,2023-10-11T21:05:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['James Freeman'],"Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Mass. Photo: Kayana Szymczak for The Wall Street Journal

Observing unhinged campus reactions to Saturday’s murderous barbarity, some commenters on social media have been recalling William F. Buckley, Jr.’s opinion that he would rather be governed by the first series of names in a telephone directory than by the faculty of Harvard. Certainly one must be extremely wary of consenting to be governed by Harvard students. But not all of their instructors would necessarily oppress us.

On Tuesday afternoon the Journal published this disturbing report from Harvard doctoral student J.J. Kimche:"
The Moral Duty to Destroy Hamas,2023-10-11T18:09:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Walter E. Block', 'Alan G. Futerman']","A mob of Islamist Arabs incited by Jew-hatred entered the town and killed as many Jews as they could find. They went door to door, broke into the homes of their victims, and slaughtered innocent men, women and children. These gangs raped, mutilated and tortured them while screaming “Kill the Jews!”

That was 94 years ago, on Saturday, Aug. 24, 1929, in Hebron. The picture is essentially the same, only that then the Arab riots that included this massacre ended with 133 Jews murdered. This time, it is several times as many, and we don’t know the final figure.

Given that the events are virtually the same, the question is: Why? There was no state of Israel in 1929. There were no “occupied” territories, no “settlers.” There was no “blockade.” No security fence, no checkpoints, nothing. If the excuses of today’s murderers did not exist at that time, what did exist? A deep, maniacal, murderous and utterly destructive hatred of Jews—the same essential factor operating today, to which all other excuses are subservient.

It has been the policy of the state of Israel not to show what its enemies do to its citizens. That both kept the victims’ dignity and prevented the demoralization of Israelis. But it also avoided letting the world see clearly what kind of threat Israelis were dealing with. What kind of true evil they are fighting against. Now that is clear. The videos showing mass murder; the kidnapping of children, elderly and women; the storming of a music festival to shoot and kill whatever person they could find; and the stories of rape, execution and utter destruction are there for the world to see.

These images and videos were propagated by the assassins themselves. They use them to show their strength and prove Israeli weakness. To demonstrate to the Palestinian Arab population that the Jews can be killed like flies. What does it say of a society that these monsters think this type of “propaganda” is a “good” way to mobilize the population? It screams of a deeply perverse and murderous culture, in love with death and destruction. It is the same culture that teaches toddlers to hate. The same society that pays wages to mass murderers and celebrates on the streets with sweets and shootings when Jews get killed. It is the culture that creates the types of monsters capable of the evil they themselves proudly show to the world through social media.

“From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” chant the useful idiots at elite institutions and parades in the West. Who are these people? Atheists who support theocratic lunatics, democrats who endorse medieval tyrants, feminists who defend misogynists who parade with the desecrated corpses of women, gays who defend maniacs who would joyfully hang them or toss them off the roof of a tall building. They talk of a secular, democratic and socialist Palestine. As George Orwell observed: “One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.” But the world has now seen what “from the river to the sea” actually means. It is nothing less than a remake of the Nazi Einsatzgruppen.

Israel expelled its own population from Gaza in 2005 so that Palestinian Arabs could begin building their own state. They instead chose Hamas. The enemies of Israel aren’t in favor of a Palestinian state. They aren’t in favor of anything positive, but only of a negative: the denial of life, especially of Jewish life. The goal is genocide. The method is mass murder of the type Jews haven’t experienced since the Holocaust.

Hence, the West needs to understand that to defend human life and dignity, it isn’t enough to claim to side with Israel. It needs to understand what this means: total, unrestrictive support. That is nothing less than allowing this beleaguered country to defend itself fully. To recognize that Hamas needs to be destroyed for the same reason and by the same method that the Nazis were. Israel is entitled to do whatever it takes to uproot this evil residing next to it. And, more important, that once it begins to proceed in that direction, it won’t be demonized for defending that which is the core of Western civilization and which its enemies hate the most: the love of everyone’s right to human life, dignity and happiness.

In other words, it needs to support a complete, total and decisive Israeli victory. If this implies an overwhelming, unprecedented use of military force, so be it. Hamas is and will be responsible for any civilian casualties. Cause and effect. They created their own destruction, and its consequences.

Mere victory isn’t enough. Israel has won every war it has ever fought. This time, the triumph must be so thorough and conclusive that there will never be any other war for this country. Israel has a moral right to finish the job, and the West has a moral duty to support it. Let Israel do what it must to finish this war in the fastest way possible, with the minimum civilian and military casualties on its side. The consequences of this lie on the group that initiated the causal sequence—the one that must be completely destroyed, Hamas.

Messrs. Block and Futerman are the co-authors of “The Classical Liberal Case for Israel.”

Secretive Hamas Commander Known as ‘The Guest’ Is Israel’s Prime Target,2023-10-11T11:08:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Rory Jones'],"People carried a portrait of Mohammed Deif, depicted as a black silhouette, commander of the armed wing of Hamas, during a demonstration in the West Bank in 2014.

Over the past two decades, Israel has tried to assassinate Mohammed Deif several times, maiming him in attacks and killing his wife and baby son. The commander of the armed wing of Hamas on Saturday inflicted in return one of the deadliest-ever Palestinian blows on Israel.

The brutality of the attacks by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, directed by Deif, have shocked even hardened Israelis. Militants mowed down revelers at a music festival, murdered entire communities of people on the Gaza border and kidnapped children and the elderly.

The assaults show how Qassam under Deif has changed from an insurgent militia into a capable fighting force, one that could prove formidable for an Israeli military contemplating a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. Qassam is now threatening to execute prisoners unless the Israeli military gives civilians a warning before they strike, posing a wrenching moral dilemma for Israel over how aggressively to respond.

There is little doubt, though, that Deif is now in the crosshairs of the Israelis. On Wednesday, Israeli airstrikes hit the home of one of his family members, killing his brother and his brother’s wife and children, according to Palestinian media reports and people in Gaza. A spokesman for Hamas didn’t respond to a request for comment on the deaths.

“In the end, we will get not only him, but the entire” leadership of Hamas, Yossi Kuperwasser, former head of research at Israel’s military intelligence agency, said of Deif. “In the long run, his calculation was wrong. He showed how savage he is.”

Among Palestinians, the secretive Qassam commander has become an almost mythical persona in his fight against Israel. Few people inside Hamas have even met Deif, who has remained in the shadows over the past two decades, fearful of Israeli bombs and bullets.

His tendency to move between homes to evade Israeli assassinations has earned him numerous nicknames. His real name isn’t believed to be Deif, which in Arabic means “guest” in reference to his nomadic lifestyle, but Mohammed al-Masri, according to the U.S. government, which designates him a terrorist.

“Deif is a ghost,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University. “He’s the commander of Al Qassam but we don’t really know who he is, and he’s the one who launched this whole operation.”

A spokesman for Hamas, Ghazi Hamad, declined to comment on the Qassam commander, saying only that “everyone now respects Mohammed Deif for his leadership of the recent assault.”

As fighters flooded through gaps in Israel’s security fence on Saturday, Arab media broadcast a silhouette of what was supposedly Deif sitting down in an office and issuing a recorded message.

Qassam had launched the operation, Deif said, so the “enemy understands that the time for him to revel without accountability has ended.”

Born in Khan Yunis, a city in the southern Gaza Strip, between 1963 and 1965, according to the U.S. government, Deif was one of the early members of the militant wing of Hamas, which emerged in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian political movement Muslim Brotherhood. The brigade is named for Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, a Syrian-born Muslim preacher who fought French and British colonial rule at the start of the last century and later against the establishment of a home for Jews in Palestine, dying at the hands of British forces in 1935.

According to Israel, Deif was the protégé of Yahya Ayyash, an explosives expert known as the Engineer, who taught Deif the art of explosives. Israel later blamed Deif for participating in a series of bombs on buses in the 1990s that killed dozens and marred the Israeli-Palestinian peace process known as the Oslo Accords.

In the early 2000s, he became commander of Hamas’s armed wing after Israel assassinated Qassam’s leader.

In 2002, Israeli security forces initially believed they had killed Deif when two army helicopters fired missiles on his Mercedes sedan in Gaza, but they later conceded he had survived and may have lost an eye. Four years later, an Israeli F-16 jet bombed a house in the north of Gaza City where Deif was located, killing nine members of a family, media reported at the time. He survived, but was again widely believed to have been badly wounded.

While the Israeli military tried to assassinate the Qassam commander, Deif sought to improve his militia’s capabilities, according to military analysts.

The Israeli military says he focused on the design of the homemade Qassam rocket, which later was repeatedly fired on Israeli cities. Israel launched a three-week ground invasion of Gaza in 2008 to stop indiscriminate rocket fire and encountered poorly trained fighters who for the most part melted away.

By 2014, however, when Israel mounted another operation inside the strip, Israeli forces encountered a more capable adversary under Deif. This time, Hamas surprised Israeli soldiers by using a network of tunnels under the walls and fences enclosing the Gaza Strip to emerge inside Israel.

Commando units that Israel believed Hamas had created only in the previous year carried out complex ambushes inside and outside Gaza. Hamas’s internal communications proved more difficult for Israel to track, and Qassam appeared to be able to better gauge Israeli troop movements.

As a weeklong truce in that conflict collapsed, Israel again tried to assassinate Deif, instead killing his wife and 7-month-old son in airstrikes. At the public funeral, the crowd waved Hamas flags and called for revenge.

But Deif largely lay low until two years ago when he emerged from the shadows with a broadcast message to weigh in on a dispute over Palestinian homes in Jerusalem. Hamas fired rockets from Gaza and helped spark an 11-day conflict that shook Israel from within.

Dina Lisnyansky, a lecturer at Israel’s Reichman University, said Deif’s influence over the wider Hamas political movement is unclear, given Israel’s repeated assassination attempts that have left him maimed. But the group is attempting to mythologize the commander via the broadcast messages that reach Palestinians across Gaza and the West Bank.

“We don’t even know how alive he is,” she said. But “it’s important to maintain him as a symbol.”

Qassam also learned two things from previous conflicts with Israel, said Michael Milshtein, a former intelligence officer for Palestinian affairs in the Israeli army who is now at Tel Aviv University. The first was that it should be the one to start the next conflict, and it should fight inside Israeli territory, rather than Gaza, to establish a Palestinian state.

But, Milshtein added, Deif may have miscalculated by killing so many civilians and will now face the force of Israel’s response.

Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to the head of the political bureau of Hamas, said Deif had “asked the people to fight for their dignity and country” after many Palestinians had tried a nonviolent approach. “This is the only language the Israelis can understand,” he said.

President Biden Calls Attack on Israel ‘Sheer Evil’,2023-10-10T10:22:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Jared Malsin', 'Ken Thomas', 'Nancy A. Youssef']","President Biden condemned Hamas’s attack on Israel as an “an act of sheer evil” that left more than 1,000 civilians dead, including at least 14 U.S. citizens, as his administration weighs how to support America’s closest ally in the Middle East without being pulled into another regional conflict.

The Israeli military massed forces on Tuesday for a ground invasion of Gaza, and Israeli officials warned of a lengthy and destructive war. Biden said that the U.S. was providing further military assistance to the country, and the Pentagon is deploying a second aircraft carrier strike group near the region to deter Hezbollah and other militant groups from joining the fight.

At the White House, Biden said the U.S. was “surging additional military assistance” to Israel, including ammunition and interceptors for its Iron Dome anti-rocket system.

“We stand with Israel, and we will make sure it has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself and respond to this attack,” Biden said.

The first plane carrying advanced U.S. weapons landed at an air base in southern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces said. In a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden called on other countries to condemn what he described as the brutal atrocities of Hamas, comparing the attack on Israel to ones carried out by Islamic State. The radical group enforced a harsh version of Islam on parts of Syria and Iraq before being crushed by international forces.

The fighting has abruptly upended the U.S. president’s efforts to bring stability to the region and preserve the Biden administration’s focus on the war in Ukraine and tensions with China. The administration is still contending with the fallout of the chaotic American withdrawal from Afghanistan.

In the Middle East, the Biden administration is now facing the prospect that the fighting in Israel and Gaza could lead to a broader regional conflict with potential American military involvement—a crisis that is further complicated by the taking of American hostages.

Israeli airstrikes reduced parts of an upmarket Gaza City neighborhood to rubble as the Israeli government stepped up its reaction to this weekend’s cross-border incursion by Hamas gunmen who killed more than 1,000 civilians and took more than 100 hostages.

Early Wednesday local time, the authorities updated the death toll to 1,200, according to Israeli public radio.

About 20 Americans remain unaccounted for, according to U.S. officials. Biden stressed the brutality and human impact of the Hamas attack. “Young people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate peace,” he said in his White House remarks Tuesday. “Infants in their mothers’ arms, grandparents in wheelchairs, Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage—hostages whom Hamas has now threatened to execute in violation of every code of human morality.”

Israeli strikes have killed 900 people in Gaza since, according to the Palestinian enclave’s health ministry. On Wednesday, an Israeli strike on a house in Gaza killed the brother of Mohammed Deif, the military commander of Hamas, according to Arabic broadcaster Al-Mayadeen.

In the Israeli city of Ashkelon, Israeli forces backed by a helicopter gunship and a drone traded fire with Palestinian fighters, continuing the battle on Israeli territory following the militants’ incursion on Saturday.

The death toll could rise considerably on both sides as Israel and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, head toward all-out war. The risk is growing that the conflict in Gaza could spill over into a regional war that draws in Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement, or even Iran, after Israeli forces traded fire with the Lebanese group’s fighters for a third straight day on Tuesday.

Hamas’s mass killing of Israelis and Israel’s planned assault on Gaza could be the start of another bloody and dangerous phase in one of the world’s longest-running and most intractable conflicts, as Israel tries to crush Hamas as a threat and the Islamist organization tries to light a spark for a broader uprising by Palestinians and their supporters across the Arab world.

For years, Israel has sought to isolate Gaza, keeping two million Palestinian civilians under blockade there while retaliating against attacks by Hamas but not aiming to eliminate the group. Reeling from Saturday’s catastrophic attack, Israel is now preparing potentially its riskiest war since its 1982 invasion of Lebanon, while Hamas seeks to light a spark for a broader uprising by Palestinians and their supporters across the Arab world.

The prospect of a war of unprecedented intensity in densely populated Gaza is also heightening fears of devastating destruction and mass loss of life among the enclave’s Palestinian population.

“The scope of this is going to be bigger than before and more severe. It’s not going to be clean…We are going to go very, very aggressively against Hamas,” Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said. “We should all change the paradigm.”

It wasn’t clear when a possible ground invasion of Gaza would begin. While Israel has mobilized more than 300,000 reservists, tens of thousands of Israeli soldiers are still sweeping southern Israel for any Hamas members still hiding in the area, and working to seal the border with Gaza, the military said.

Israeli officials have urged Palestinians fleeing the bombing to leave the Gaza Strip entirely—an option they don’t have since the strip’s borders are sealed by both Israel and Egypt.

Israel has cut off supplies of food, electricity and fuel to the enclave, raising the pressure on Gazan civilians to leave ahead of an invasion.

Asked where Gaza residents should go, Hecht urged Palestinians to use the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. “Anyone who can get out, I would advise them to get out,” he said.

However, the Rafah crossing shut down on Monday after an Israeli airstrike on the border terminal. Even in calmer times, most Gazans can’t cross the border without special permission from Egypt, which residents say is nearly impossible to obtain.

Hecht later tweeted in clarification: “I said they should check if Rafah is possibly open. And that I’m not aware if its [sic] still open. The IDF is not in charge of that crossing.”

Israel faces a major military challenge in Gaza. An attempt to dislodge Hamas or fully reoccupy the strip would likely result in a long war of attrition, military analysts say. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have thousands of fighters, a network of underground tunnels, and would have the advantage of defending an urban area against an attack.

“I still find a full reoccupation of Gaza quite difficult. You’re talking about an area in which they haven’t been on the ground since 2005 and [Hamas] were able to prepare this whole operation without Israeli intelligence having a clue,” said Mouin Rabbani, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies, an independent research center based in Qatar.

Hamas on Tuesday called for a “general mobilization” throughout the region in support of Palestinians, specifically urging young people in the occupied West Bank to confront Israeli soldiers, opening the door to protests and possible clashes. Palestinian militants launched more rockets into southern Israel on Tuesday, killing two foreign workers in the Eshkol region, according to Israeli first responders.

Elsewhere, Israeli police shot dead two Palestinians who threw fireworks at police in East Jerusalem’s Silwan neighborhood on Tuesday, according to Israeli police and the Palestinian Red Crescent.

The continuing Israeli airstrikes underscore a dilemma facing Israel’s government, which is trying to free the Israelis who were taken captive by Hamas during its raid. Hamas’s military wing on Monday threatened to execute civilian hostages if Israel continued to bomb civilian homes without warning. Israel’s heavy strikes on the strip also risk accidentally killing hostages, who are being held in unknown locations.

“It’s a sensitive one,” said Hecht of the hostages. “We’re handling it and we’re going to try and act in a disruptive and severe way.”

Between 100 and 150 Israelis are currently being held by Hamas in Gaza, according to Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations.

Egyptian and Hamas officials said that the group isn’t willing to engage in talks over the hostages until Israel’s bombing in Gaza stops.

Israel has carried out four separate military offensives in Gaza since 2008, each one ending inconclusively, with Hamas remaining in control of the enclave. Israeli officials say their goal this time will be to strike a decisive blow against Hamas.

The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier arrived on Tuesday in the region with its accompanying guided-missile destroyers, U.S. Central Command said in a statement.

The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and its accompanying ships were scheduled months ago to sail this week for the region. They are expected to reach the area in roughly two weeks, defense officials said. The Pentagon is considering, but hasn’t formally decided, whether the Eisenhower will relieve the Ford or both groups will remain, defense officials said.

The leaders of the U.S., France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. voiced strong backing for Israel as it responded to this weekend’s attack, signaling the support of leading Western countries for the coming offensive against Hamas.

“We make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned,” the leaders said in a joint statement. “Our countries will support Israel in its efforts to defend itself and its people against such atrocities.”

Middle Eastern nations including Egypt have tried, so far fruitlessly, to calm the situation, working to prevent a military escalation that could provoke a surge of displaced people toward the Egyptian border. Turkey has also said it is working to defuse the situation and offered to mediate in a potential prisoner exchange.

The Gaza Strip, a ribbon of land along the Mediterranean coast about twice the size of Washington, D.C., has been all but sealed off from the world since 2007 when Israel closed its borders to Palestinians in the enclave. The closure ended decades in which many Gazans worked inside Israel and moved freely throughout the country after Israel’s 1967 occupation of the enclave, a part of historic Palestine that had been controlled by Egypt.

Israel withdrew its remaining settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005. Hamas won Palestinian legislative elections in 2006, and seized greater control of Gaza in a 2007 military takeover that caused a schism with the rival Fatah movement, which controls the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.

Since the 2007 closure Gaza has been in the grips of a deepening humanitarian crisis, with the blockade degrading the strip’s economy and restrictions on the transfer of basic goods eroding its water, electrical and other civilian infrastructure. In its series of wars with Hamas, Israeli bombs have hit the strip’s airport, power plant, and U.N. warehouses and schools.

In Gaza City’s Rimal neighborhood, an upmarket area of shopping malls, broad boulevards, restaurants and apartment blocks, residents stepped over piles of broken concrete on Tuesday while the sound of explosions thudded in the distance. The Israeli military warned everyone in Rimal on Monday to leave the area and head toward the southern Gaza Strip.

“There were people trapped under one of the residential buildings but no one could reach them. They were actually texting for help and stating that they were suffocating,” said Mahmoud Shalabi, a program manager in Gaza for the London-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. The trapped people were later rescued, he said.

“What’s happening right now, as it is, is worse than any other escalation that Gaza has ever seen, so I hope that there will be no ground invasion and that this cloud will pass, but we are really concerned about what’s to come,” Shalabi said.

Gaza residents say they are spending their nights in fear, with long power outages and the sound of explosions. “The bombing is around me all the time. The darkness in the night is a cruel monster,” said Rama Husain Abu Amra, a 21-year-old student studying translation. “I want to continue our normal life, going to work, going to my university.”

Israel’s response to Hamas’s attack has forced more than 200,000 Palestinians to flee their homes in Gaza, according to the U.N.’s Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory Lynn Hastings.

Four U.N. schools, six hospitals and the building housing the headquarters of the U.N.’s relief agency for Palestinian refugees have been damaged since the start of the Israeli military operation, the U.N. said.

The Israeli air force said on Tuesday morning that it had dropped hundreds of bombs and thousands of tons of munitions throughout Gaza including on Rimal, saying it was targeting Hamas intelligence infrastructure and the homes of Palestinian militants.

The air force said in a tweet that the Israeli military operation “continues to cause maximum damage.”

Hecht said Israel’s capacity for precision strikes is currently reduced because Israeli personnel are stretched, and that therefore strikes in Gaza wouldn’t be carried out with the same “level of fidelity” as before.

The risk of war on a second front is rising after Israeli forces and Hezbollah traded fire for a third straight day on Tuesday, with Israeli artillery and a helicopter firing into Lebanon in response to rocket fire claimed by the Lebanese group. Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shiite militant group that the U.S. has designated as a terrorist organization, hasn’t said it would join the conflict but hasn’t ruled it out.

An exchange of fire on Monday killed at least three members of the group and one Israeli military officer. Israel said it launched airstrikes and artillery fire into Lebanon after unknown suspects crossed the border into Israeli territory.

With Hezbollah’s large arsenal of missiles capable of firing deep into Israeli territory, the group would likely provoke a massive Israeli military response if it entered the war. All-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, which is considerably stronger militarily than Hamas, could be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
"Peace, Deterrence and Other Gods That Failed",2023-10-10T21:46:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Elliot Kaufman'],"“Too long have I lived among men who hate peace,” says Psalm 120, recited by Jews around the world for safety in Israel. “I am for peace; but whenever I speak of it, they are for war.” Israelis know the feeling. They awoke Saturday to a jihadist invasion that may shatter as many illusions as it has lives.

How can it be, Israelis have begun to ask, that they allowed a genocidal terrorist group to reign for so long in Gaza, the fiefdom next door? There was no mystery about Hamas’s intentions. It seeks to kill Israel’s Jews any way it can.

Crazy as it now seems, Israelis learned to live with that. They took a series of defensive measures: a blockade to keep weapons out, a missile-defense system to shoot down cheap rockets, and, when those rockets got out of hand, brief campaigns of targeted strikes to quiet Hamas down. But Hamas never had to worry about Israel sweeping it from power.

To force out Hamas, Israel might have had to govern Gaza itself, and the usual suspects in the safe Western democracies—diplomats, reporters, human-rights groups and prize-seeking politicians—would have screamed bloody murder. Our cautious eminences would have deemed it “bad for peace.” But as the Jewish tradition teaches, whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind.

A perverse alternative reality was constructed in which every Israeli response to the threat from Hamas was illegal, immoral and disproportionate, a war crime if not sadistic outright. Gaza, which Israel gave up in 2005, is still called “Israeli-occupied” by the U.N., a claim Western media parroted. Never mind the territory’s dictatorial rulers sworn to Israel’s violent destruction. The terrorists themselves—the ones live-streaming their slaughter and mutilation of defenseless Jewish civilians to shouts of “Allahu akbar”—were politely termed “militants,” their savagery usually excused as a Newtonian reaction to Israeli security measures.

Israel was even condemned for using force to stop Hamas’s previous attempts to rush the border. Gullible Western media described those would-be infiltrators as “protesters.” Did Israel really need to shoot?

On Sunday, after a meeting with the Turkish foreign minister, Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted, “I encouraged Türkiye’s advocacy for a cease-fire and the release of all hostages held by Hamas immediately.” He deleted the tweet as criticism mounted, but we should recognize it as his department’s first instinct. Its Office for Palestinian Affairs (in another deleted tweet) had already urged “all sides to refrain from violence and retaliatory attacks.”

This is like calling for a cease-fire the day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It’s just another word for surrender. Peace isn’t the answer when the enemy will come back to kill you the next day.

But what could be more ingrained and respectable than the push to impose such a peace on Israel? Enlightened opinion in the West is firm that Israel needs to “end the occupation” in the West Bank, establishing a Palestinian state a stone’s throw from Israel’s capital, or a binational state in which Israel’s Jews are subject to an Arab majority. Not doing so, Israelis are told, is unsustainable and against international law. It’s even “apartheid.” In other words, by law Israel must offer up its major population centers for the kind of slaughter we have witnessed in its south, doubtless provoking an even larger war. We call this “the peace process.”

The Second Intifada (2000-05) disabused many Israelis of that idea. Maybe this, a whole intifada packed into a single weekend, will help Western liberals catch up. The two-state solution, rejected by the Palestinians every time it has been offered, is dead. Palestinian terrorism has killed it.

Israelis instead have put their faith in deterrence. Hezbollah, the story used to go, had been deterred by the pummeling it received in the 2006 Lebanon war. Iran, beset by the sabotage, bombings and assassinations that a former Mossad director called “divine intervention,” knew that it could push Israel only so far. Hamas, too, it was thought, had been deterred by its previous bouts with Israel. That Hamas had stayed out of recent exchanges between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad was taken as confirmation of the thesis.

Until Saturday, the threat from Gaza was supposed to be manageable. Israel even allowed Qatar to deliver monthly cash infusions to Hamas to grease the peace. The Jerusalem Post’s Yonah Jeremy Bob, an expert on Israeli intelligence, writes that “every official who briefed the Jerusalem Post made it clear that Hamas was broadly deterred from a big conflict with Israel.”

They were dead wrong, and Israel will never be the same because of it. One wonders if evidence will emerge that this conceptual error concerning deterrence, in a replay of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, led Israeli intelligence to discount indications of aggression. More important for the future, has Israel made a similar mistake with Hezbollah—sitting on its northern border with more than 100,000 rockets? We may find out in the coming days.

How about with Iran? Like the Psalmist, the Biden administration is all for peace. Its plan is to pay as much as it takes for Iran to stand on the nuclear threshold without tipping over. But Iran is for war. It doesn’t stop pursuing nuclear weapons, and it sustains 19 terrorist proxies, including Hamas. For 20 years, Israel has sought to buy time and establish deterrence by striking Iran in the shadows. Once considered aggressive, this policy, too, may come to be seen as remarkably dangerous—because it is so restrained.

Harvard Shrugs at Jew-Hatred,2023-10-10T17:59:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['J.J. Kimche'],"Cambridge, Mass.

Hamas’s attack on Israel was a small-scale Holocaust, a moment no Jew alive with the tiniest speck of communal feeling will ever forget. As a Jewish student, I was similarly chilled by the reactions at Harvard.

The university’s “Palestine Solidarity Groups,” a collection of some 30 student groups, issued a statement exculpating the terrorists for their acts of murder, rape, kidnapping and mayhem. “We, the undersigned student organizations,” it began, “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” The signatories—groups such as the Harvard Islamic Society and Harvard Law School Justice for Palestine—made clear that they stand shoulder-to-shoulder with this “resistance,” fashionable doublespeak for those feverishly working to wipe Jews off the face of the earth. Harvard isn’t alone: Some 50 student organizations at the University of California, Berkeley declared their “unwavering support for the resistance in Gaza.”

Most Jewish students have harbored mixed feelings toward pro-Palestinian groups on our campuses. Some sympathize with their cause; others see them as hostile; most ignore them. By and large, we have been happy to regard members of such groups as fellow travelers on the journey of learning and discovery, with whom we share spaces and engage in respectful classroom discussion. But during a moment of stunning moral clarity—such as the live-streaming of masked terrorists gleefully machine-gunning Jewish families—one would expect fellow students of all political persuasions to unite in horror and condemnation. The deepest political differences can be tolerated if we all abide by a basic framework of decency.

Not only have our fellow students failed to condemn this proto-genocide; they have justified and celebrated it. The authors and signatories of this statement, men and women with whom we share dormitories and libraries, have exposed themselves as worse than common anti-Semites. They are enthusiastic proponents of our slaughter, a vanguard of apologists for those who seek the extermination of the Jewish people.

This realization has grave consequences not only for Jewish life on campus but for the university’s existence as a community. How can we share dormitories, classrooms and ideas with students who would makes excuses or even celebrate if we and our families were hacked to death by a Hamas terrorist tomorrow?

Harvard’s top administrators made no effort to assuage such fears. The Harvard media office didn’t respond to my request for comment on Monday afternoon. That night, 18 administrators put out an equivocal statement titled “War in the Middle East” that only mildly criticized Hamas and made no mention of the student groups cheering its atrocities. Only on Tuesday did President Claudine Gay “condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas.” She didn’t condemn the statement excusing Hamas, but merely distanced herself from it: “No student group—not even 30 student groups—speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.”

As a grandson of an Auschwitz survivor and a student of German-Jewish history, I was always incredulous that highly cultured Germans, the people of Goethe and Beethoven, could have displayed sympathy and even enthusiasm for the Nazi slaughter of the Jews. Now I believe it. I have seen it happen here.

Hamas Attacks Are the Beginning of the End for Netanyahu,2023-10-10T17:03:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['William A. Galston'],"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a confident address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 22. The skeptics were wrong, he said; Israel reached the Abraham Accords with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco without a peace agreement with the Palestinians. These accords herald “the dawn of a new age of peace” in the Middle East, which will be capped by an accord between Israel and Saudi Arabia. When this happens—Mr. Netanyahu said “when,” not “if”—the Palestinians will be “more likely to abandon the fantasy of destroying Israel and finally embrace a path of genuine peace with it.”

Fifteen days later, Hamas mounted a surprise terror attack that killed at least 1,000 Israelis, mostly civilians, and wounded at least 3,400 more. The Saudis could have responded with a forthright denunciation of these murders, committed by an organization whose ideology places it squarely in the camp of Saudi Arabia’s enemies. Instead, the kingdom’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement noting its “repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation, and deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.” The Saudi message to Mr. Netanyahu: Do not imagine that we are free to set aside the Palestinian issue on the path to normal relations.

Yet whatever this may mean for Palestinians on the West Bank, Hamas is a different matter. There can be no peace between Israel and Hamas, because Hamas from its beginning to now has been sworn to Israel’s destruction.

Don’t take my word for it—read the organization’s statement of “General Principles and Policies,” issued in 2017. Palestine, the document says, extends from “the River Jordan in the east to the Mediterranean in the west.” It is an “integral”—that is, indivisible—territorial unit. More, it is a “sacred land” at the heart of the Arab and Islamic community and enjoys a “special status.”

Hamas says that the “Zionist project,” which is “racist, aggressive, colonial, and expansionist,” is wholly illegitimate, as are the Balfour Declaration, the British Mandate, and the U.N. Palestine Partition resolution. The establishment of Israel is “entirely illegal.” The document continues: “Hamas believes that no part of the land of Palestine shall be compromised or conceded” and that there must be “no recognition of the legitimacy of the Zionist entity.”

Hamas insists that its quarrel is with Zionists, not with the Jews and their religion. Its founding charter, issued in 1988, undermines this claim. Article 7 of this document quotes a saying of the prophet Muhammad: “The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say, ‘Oh Muslims, Oh Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.’ ”

How do you deal with an implacable enemy sworn to your political and physical destruction? Israel has long relied on deterrence and defense; both have failed. It now faces a new situation. The initial response has been massive airstrikes plus a total blockade of Gaza. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced that “there will be no electricity, no food, no fuel. Everything is closed.”

This is just the beginning. I believe Mr. Netanyahu has decided on an all-out land invasion of Gaza and that, faced with these circumstances, any Israeli leader would do the same. In a briefing Monday, retired Israeli Maj. Gen. Noam Tibon, a widely respected counterterrorism expert and vigorous supporter of a two-state solution, said, “We must push the war as much as possible into Gaza.” He insisted that “Hamas has to pay” and that Israel has no choice other than to win a “decisive victory.” He acknowledged that this invasion will be brutal and ugly and could lead to the execution of the hostages Hamas has seized but suggested that these dreadful consequences shouldn’t prevent the operation.

Now is not the time for recriminations, but they will come. After the operation in Gaza ends, there likely will be a commission of inquiry, as there was after the Yom Kippur War half a century ago. It is too soon to know what the inquiry will reveal, but reports, which the government has denied, suggest that it ignored repeated warnings from Egypt. Aharon Ze’evi Farkash, an Israel Defense Forces former head of intelligence, has charged that the government diverted troops from the defense of Israeli towns near Gaza to operations in the West Bank. There clearly was a massive intelligence failure, and the IDF’s response to the invasion was painfully slow.

Wars change nations. Throughout his career, Mr. Netanyahu has portrayed himself as the leader best able to ensure Israel’s security. The events of the past few days have undermined this claim. I suspect that his political career will end soon after the war does, setting the stage for profound changes in Israeli politics.

In an interview with 'Global View' columnist Walter Russell Mead, the Prime Minister of Israel pointed to developments in Iran, then queried what might happen should it become the first nuclear power run by radical Islam.

Hamas’s Global Test for Biden,2023-10-09T22:13:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Walter Russell Mead'],"Gaza is burning as Israeli forces methodically proceed to dismantle its structures of terror. The coming retribution will be terrible, but it is necessary and just. Hamas has lost the right to rule Gaza. It must be dismantled and disarmed, and neither Israel nor its neighbors can permit the group to return to power. Despite the best efforts of the Israel Defense Forces, innocent civilians will suffer, and too many will die. Urban warfare against a brutal enemy that doesn’t scruple to use civilians as shields can have no other result, but what is coming to Gaza is not the fault of the IDF.

What will follow the fighting can’t be foreseen. The establishment of a new Palestinian governing authority for the territory, linked to Fatah, closely guarded by Israel and Egypt, and funded by the Gulf states would be perhaps the best outcome for all concerned, but the war must be won before peace can be built.

At best, Gaza’s future seems bleak. More than two million people are crowded into a barren wasteland with few natural resources and little hope. A rational Palestinian leadership would understand that, so situated, the only hope for the people of Gaza lies in close collaboration with Egypt and Israel. It would then settle down to the hard but necessary task of creating an economy that can support its people with dignity and security.

Hamas has had other ideas. The misery and poverty of the Palestinian people is the soil, the only soil, in which a movement this perverted can flourish. Hamas has done all it could to keep Gaza wretched while inculcating an ideology of genocidal rage.

Israelis are temporarily setting their differences aside in the face of this hideous shock, as well they should. But there will be a reckoning in Israel too. Those who missed or misread the signs of danger will be driven ingloriously from office if they lack the grace to resign. A national-security establishment that wasted the past year in frenzied political infighting shouldn’t be allowed to escape harsh public scrutiny. From the prime minister to the intelligence chiefs, those at the helm of Israel’s affairs will have to account for their actions.

We aren’t yet past the height of this crisis. While the exact details of Iranian involvement in the attacks are unknown, there is no doubt that Iran trained, supported, advised and equipped the killers. The hands of the mullahs are dripping with Jewish blood, and no one in Israel doubts that the fanatics in Tehran are hungry for more. In self-defense, Israel can’t allow Iran’s engagement with Hamas to go unpunished, but taking on a near-nuclear regional superpower means potentially a much wider war.

The consequences of the Hamas attack for President Biden’s Middle East policy are, as Iran may well have calculated, devastating. Desperate to avoid a Middle East crisis while war rages in Europe, oil prices rise and tensions over Taiwan mount, the Biden administration has consistently sought to pacify Iran.

Believing détente with the mullahs to be America’s best hope of avoiding yet another conflict in the Middle East, Mr. Biden has extended olive branch after olive branch to Tehran, which has slapped them away. Iran turned down the Biden administration’s offer to re-enter the nuclear deal. It wasn’t moved by the administration’s quiet but dramatic loosening of sanctions. It released five hostages in exchange for $6 billion but is obviously more interested in collecting ransoms than in building bridges to Washington.

There’s a pattern here. When he arrived in the White House, Mr. Biden hoped, in a phrase administration officials often used at the time, to “park Russia.” In the spring of 2021 he exempted a company engaged in the construction of the massive Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from U.S. sanctions and publicly contradicted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s claim that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was ready to accept Ukrainian membership. Instead of applauding Mr. Biden’s statesmanship, Vladimir Putin thought he smelled Western weakness and cast his covetous eyes toward Kyiv.

Mr. Biden has tried even harder to park Iran, but as Tehran’s support for Hamas’s attack on Israel demonstrates, he hasn’t had much success. It’s a failure Franklin D. Roosevelt would have foreseen. “No man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it,” FDR said. “There can be no appeasement with ruthlessness. There can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb.” The Biden administration hasn’t merely been stroking the Iranian tiger, it has fed it salmon and cream, yet the tiger isn’t satisfied.

The Hamas attack was not only an assault on Israel. In recent months, Mr. Biden’s efforts to promote normalization of Saudi-Israeli relations began to bear fruit. American backing for a security and diplomatic partnership between Israel and Saudi Arabia has the potential to stabilize the Middle East while limiting America’s direct military role. A major war between Israel and Hamas, the Iranians hope, will throw a monkey wrench into Team Biden’s plans.

The world will now see what Mr. Biden is made of. Will he stand up against terrorists seeking to derail what could otherwise be his greatest diplomatic accomplishment? Will he offer Jerusalem his full military and diplomatic support when and if it is ready to show Iran the price of supporting mass murder in Israel? Or will he abandon America’s closest Middle East partners in their hour of greatest need?

Fecklessness in Washington breeds recklessness abroad. Standing by Israel in a confrontation with Iran carries risk, but yielding to Iranian threats is more dangerous still. As Winston Churchill said to Neville Chamberlain after Munich, “You were given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor, and you will have war.”

Unless Israel and the U.S. acting together can deter Iran from more aggression, Mr. Biden could soon face a similar choice.

Hamas’s al-Aqsa Lie Has a Long and Disgraceful History,2023-10-09T18:34:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Douglas J. Feith'],"Most of the coverage of the Hamas-Israel war omits the reason for Hamas’s attack. Reports that do address the question often cite the official Hamas explanation that Israel is plotting to destroy the al-Aqsa Mosque on Jerusalem’s Temple Mount. Hamas calls this war “Operation al-Aqsa Deluge.” But that justification is a fraud. The mosque is in no danger, and Hamas isn’t defending any Muslim holy site. The attack is offensive. Hamas wants to torture and kill Israelis in hopes of triggering mass uprisings by Muslims and perhaps spurring a larger war that might wound and isolate Israel, with the ultimate aim of destroying the Jewish state.

The accusation that the Jews are plotting against al-Aqsa was concocted a century ago by Haj Amin al-Husseini (1897-1974), the predominant political leader of the Palestinian Arabs from the 1920s through World War II and beyond.

Haj Amin, an Islamist radical from a notable Jerusalem clan, became a significant figure at age 24 when a British official appointed him mufti of Jerusalem, a high religious office. Britain made the appointment because it conquered much of the Near East—including Palestine—in World War I, after the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire sided with the Germans. The British victory ended 400 years of Turkish rule.

The Arab-Jewish conflict arose from the peace settlement after the war, which put the approximately 19 million Arabs of the Near East on the path to sovereignty over 99% of the region’s territory. The remaining less than 1% was Palestine west of the Jordan River, the bulk of the ancient Jewish homeland. It was put into a trust, called a “mandate,” for the benefit of world Jewry, which then constituted some 15 million people. Its small population of Arabs—600,000 or so—naturally preferred to remain the majority, like Arabs in the rest of the Near East. The Jewish people, however, would then have had to live as a stateless and vulnerable minority everywhere, and enjoy national self-determination nowhere.

Haj Amin was a violent enemy of Zionism. He had no interest in sharing the land, no sympathy for the Jews, and no interest in peace with them. He said Palestine belonged to the Arabs, period. While Zionist leaders time and again showed a willingness to accept the best deal offered to them—to set up a state in less territory than they believed they were entitled to—Haj Amin argued that national control of the land was a matter of honor and religious faith and therefore couldn’t be compromised.

Haj Amin expanded his power beyond the religious sphere by appealing to the public’s nationalist passions. He concentrated on making a white-hot issue out of Jerusalem. He claimed the Jews weren’t interested only in a national home but intended to wreck Islam’s holy sites on the Temple Mount and eliminate Arabs from the country. He repeated these accusations for decades, summarizing them in an article he published in the 1950s: There is “a plot devised long ago between the Jews and colonialism,” he wrote, and its aim is “to remove the indigenous Arabs from their homeland.”

This “plot also intends to terminally eliminate the Arab character, religion, holy places and places of worship in this country” and “to uproot its sons,” he wrote. “They also intend to rebuild the Jewish temple known as the Temple of Solomon on the current site of the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque.” He described “our battle with World Jewry” as “a question of life and death, a battle between two conflicting faiths, each of which can exist only on the ruins of the other.”

Haj Amin positioned himself as Islam’s champion in Jerusalem. He made a project of heightening the city’s importance in Muslim eyes and systematically—and falsely—alleging horrific Jewish threats. He succeeded in becoming the predominant Palestinian Arab political leader of the 1930s and ’40s. Britain expelled him from Palestine in the late 1930s for supporting terrorism. During World War II, he helped organize a pro-Nazi coup in Baghdad, which Britain helped suppress. Haj Amin then fled to Berlin, where he met Hitler, became a Nazi government guest, made pro-German wartime propaganda broadcasts, and helped the SS recruit Bosnian Muslims. Haj Amin’s embrace of Hitler discredited the Arab cause in Palestine, making Palestinian Arabs diplomatic pariahs for a quarter century after World War II.

Today, Hamas brazenly uses Haj Amin’s playbook. Its leaders hope to rally the Muslim world by repeating the mufti’s claims of Jewish threats to al-Aqsa. The allegations’ falsity should be obvious. Israel has controlled the Temple Mount for 50 years. It hasn’t destroyed the al-Aqsa Mosque or the Dome of the Rock. Regarding freedom of worship on the Temple Mount, it has shown extraordinary deference to Muslim interests and sensibilities. Muslims pray there without hindrance. Visits by Jews are allowed, but not in the main buildings, and Arab security personnel generally prohibit open prayer outdoors.

The alleged Jewish threat to al-Aqsa has been bogus since Haj Amin invented it. Hamas’s actual goal, also borrowed from the mufti, is to drive the Jews out of Israel—to win what he saw as “a battle between two conflicting faiths, each of which can exist only on the ruins of the other.”

In aligning itself with Haj Amin, Hamas conceives and fights its battle against Israel in such a way that diplomacy cannot resolve. Opposing all compromise, Hamas demands a fight to the death.

Iran Helped Plot Attack on Israel Over Several Weeks,2023-10-08T20:40:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Summer Said', 'Benoit Faucon', 'Stephen Kalin']","DUBAI—Iranian security officials helped plan Hamas’s Saturday surprise attack on Israel and gave the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut last Monday, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iran-backed militant group.

Officers of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had worked with Hamas since August to devise the air, land and sea incursions—the most significant breach of Israel’s borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War—those people said.

Details of the operation were refined during several meetings in Beirut attended by IRGC officers and representatives of four Iran-backed militant groups, including Hamas, which holds power in Gaza, and Hezbollah, a Shiite militant group and political faction in Lebanon, they said.

U.S. officials say they haven’t seen evidence of Tehran’s involvement. In an interview with CNN that aired Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: “We have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind this particular attack, but there is certainly a long relationship.”

“We don’t have any information at this time to corroborate this account,” said a U.S. official of the meetings.

A European official and an adviser to the Syrian government, however, gave the same account of Iran’s involvement in the lead-up to the attack as the senior Hamas and Hezbollah members.

Asked about the meetings, Mahmoud Mirdawi, a senior Hamas official, said the group planned the attacks on its own. “This is a Palestinian and Hamas decision,” he said.

A spokesman for Iran’s mission to the United Nations said the Islamic Republic stood in support of Gaza’s actions but didn’t direct them.

“The decisions made by the Palestinian resistance are fiercely autonomous and unwaveringly aligned with the legitimate interests of the Palestinian people,” the spokesman said. “We are not involved in Palestine’s response, as it is taken solely by Palestine itself.”

A direct Iranian role would take Tehran’s long-running conflict with Israel out of the shadows, raising the risk of broader conflict in the Middle East. Senior Israeli security officials have pledged to strike at Iran’s leadership if Tehran is found responsible for killing Israelis.

The IRGC’s broader plan is to create a multi-front threat that can strangle Israel from all sides—Hezbollah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the north and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, according to the senior Hamas and Hezbollah members and an Iranian official.

At least 700 Israelis are confirmed dead, and Saturday’s assault has punctured the country’s aura of invincibility and left Israelis questioning how their vaunted security forces could let this happen.

Israel has blamed Iran, saying it is behind the attacks, if indirectly. ​​ “We know that there were meetings in Syria and in Lebanon with other leaders of the terror armies that surround Israel so obviously it’s easy to understand that they tried to coordinate. The proxies of Iran in our region, they tried to be coordinated as much as possible with Iran,” Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said Sunday.

Hamas has publicly acknowledged receiving support from Iran. And on Sunday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi talked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ziyad al-Nakhalah and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh.

Iran has been setting aside other regional conflicts, such as its open feud with Saudi Arabia in Yemen, to devote the IRGC’s foreign resources toward coordinating, financing and arming militias antagonistic to Israel, including Hamas and Hezbollah, the senior Hamas and Hezbollah members said.

The U.S. and Israel have designated Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations.

“We are now free to focus on the Zionist entity,” the Iranian official said. “They are now very isolated.”

The strike was intended to hit Israel while it appeared distracted by internal political divisions over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. It was also aimed at disrupting accelerating U.S.-brokered talks to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel that Iran saw as threatening, the senior Hamas and Hezbollah members said.

Building on peace deals with Egypt and Jordan, expanding Israeli ties with Gulf Arab states could create a chain of American allies linking three key choke points of global trade—the Suez Canal, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Bab Al Mandeb connecting the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea, said Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.

“That’s very bad news for Iran,” Ibish said. “If they could do this, the strategic map changes dramatically to Iran’s detriment.”

Leading the effort to wrangle Iran’s foreign proxies under a unified command has been Ismail Qaani, the leader of the IRGC’s international military arm, the Quds Force.

Qaani launched coordination among several militias surrounding Israel in April during a meeting in Lebanon, The Wall Street Journal has reported, where Hamas began working more closely with other groups such as Hezbollah for the first time.

Around that time, Palestinian groups staged a rare set of limited strikes on Israel from Lebanon and Gaza, under the direction of Iran, said the Iranian official. “It was a roaring success,” the official said.

Iran has long backed Hamas but, as a Sunni Muslim group, it had been an outsider among Tehran’s Shia proxies until recent months, when cooperation among the groups accelerated.

Representatives of these groups have met with Quds Force leaders at least biweekly in Lebanon since August to discuss this weekend’s attack on Israel and what happens next, they said. Qaani has attended some of those meetings along with Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah, Islamic Jihad leader al-Nakhalah, and Saleh al-Arouri, Hamas’s military chief, the militant-group members said.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian attended at least two of the meetings, they said.

“An attack of such scope could only have happened after months of planning and would not have happened without coordination with Iran,” said Lina Khatib, director of the SOAS Middle East Institute at the University of London. “Hamas, like Hezbollah in Lebanon, does not single-handedly make decisions to engage in war without prior explicit agreement from Iran.”

The Palestinian and Lebanese militias’ ability to coordinate with Iran will be tested in the coming days as Israel’s response comes into focus.

Egypt, which is trying to mediate in the conflict, has warned Israeli officials that a ground invasion into Gaza would trigger a military response from Hezbollah, opening up a second battlefront, people familiar with the matter said. Israel and Hezbollah exchanged fire briefly on Sunday.

Hamas has called on Palestinians in the West Bank and Palestinian citizens of Israel to take up arms and join the fight. There have been limited clashes in the West Bank, but no reports of clashes between Arabs and Jews inside Israel, as happened in May 2021 when Israel and Gaza last engaged in extended combat.

The Iranian official said that if Iran were attacked, it would respond with missile strikes on Israel from Lebanon, Yemen and Iran, and send Iranian fighters into Israel from Syria to attack cities in the north and east of Israel.

Iran’s backing of a coordinated group of Arab militias is ominous for Israel. In previous conflicts, the Soviet Union was the ultimate patron of Israel’s Arab enemies and was always able to pressure them to reach some type of accommodation or recognize a red line, said Bernard Hudson, a former counterterrorism chief for the Central Intelligence Agency.

“The Soviets never considered Israel a permanent foe,” he said. “Iran’s leadership clearly does.”

Israel’s Opportunity to Destroy Hamas,2023-10-07T19:27:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Daniel Pipes'],"Hamas’s surprise attack is a humanitarian horror. It is also a strategic opportunity for Israel, the U.S. and democracies everywhere.

Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which author Cynthia Farahat describes as “the world’s incubator of modern Islamic terrorism.” From Hamas’s origins in 1987, it has engaged in violence against Israelis, Palestinians and whoever else might cross its path. A sequence of Israeli missteps led in 2007 to its taking power in the Gaza Strip, an area the size of Omaha, Neb., with a population of two million. It imposed a totalitarian rule on Gaza similar to that of the mullahs in Iran, attempting to implement medieval strictures, oppressing its own population, and threatening to destroy Israel.

There are many indications that Gazans hate Hamas. “There is boiling anger in the streets against the Hamas movement,” Tholfekar Swairjo, a Gazan political analyst, told NPR in 2022. “They are blamed for the very low quality of life in Gaza.” A 32-year-old woman said that “most Gazans have stopped believing in Hamas and the others. You know why? Because they don’t feed us, they don’t provide anything. You have to depend on yourself. How can we build a future with these guys?”

Polling finds overwhelming support among Palestinians, especially in Gaza, for the statement that “Palestinians should push harder to replace their own political leaders with more effective and less corrupt ones.” Gazans also reject Hamas by emigrating in droves. An estimated 250,000 to 350,000 young adults have left the strip since Hamas took over in 2007.

In short, most Gazans loathe Hamas, but they dare not rise up against their power-hungry oppressors, who enjoy support from Iran. What about Israel? It has the motive and the means to end Hamas rule, but its security establishment has preferred that Hamas, for all its horrors and threats, stay in power rather than have the Israel Defense Forces move back into Gaza (from which they withdrew in 2005) and run the territory again. For one sign of Israel’s acquiescence to Hamas rule, note that it permits and even encourages the government of Qatar to send Hamas $30 million a month.

As a result, nothing changes. Perhaps the moment has come for American leadership. In 2003, President George W. Bush said that “the free world, those who love freedom and peace, must deal harshly with Hamas” and that “Hamas must be dismantled.” President Barack Obama said in 2014: “I have no sympathy for Hamas. I have great sympathy for ordinary people who are struggling within Gaza.”

Joe Biden should join their ranks. In a statement Saturday, he said he “unequivocally condemns this appalling assault”—a good start. The next step is to urge Israel to remove Hamas. Perhaps this, along with the size and barbarism of the latest assault, will change the Israeli security establishment’s reluctant acceptance of Hamas and persuade it to rid the world of this scourge.

Once Gaza has been secured, Israel would find a great number of its inhabitants ready to start over and build productive lives rather than focus endlessly and hopelessly on the destruction of Israel. Gaza could aspire to become the “Singapore of the Middle East” of which optimists dreamed decades ago. None of this can happen as long as Iran’s medieval-minded agents run the enclave.

The Hamas charter of 1988 calls for Islam to “obliterate” Israel. After this vicious assault, the time has come for Israel to obliterate Hamas.

The Iran-Gaza War,2023-10-08T19:59:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Eugene Kontorovich'],"Jerusalem

As Jews celebrated a festive holiday on Saturday, the Iranian-backed Palestinian militia Hamas invaded Israel from Gaza. Spreading out through Israeli towns, the terrorists went house to house gunning down innocent civilians, including hundreds of young revelers at an outdoor “peace” rave. They abducted scores of civilians—the precise count is as yet unknown—including women and children, as hostages; and chilling videos have surfaced of them desecrating bodies and parading captives through the streets of Gaza, as large crowds yell “God is great.”

It is a rampage of unspeakable cruelty, the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. It is also a security catastrophe of unprecedented proportions for Israel’s military and political class. Much time will be spent figuring out the causes and responsibility. For now, some broader observations:

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

First, call it the Iran-Gaza War. To be sure, Hamas bears responsibility, and any serious Israeli response will involve its total, unconditional defeat. But Hamas is an ally and instrument of Iran. An operation of such scale and complexity is unlike anything Hamas has previously attempted and strongly suggests significant Iranian involvement. Hamas has publicly thanked Iran for its support, and Iran’s supreme leader applauded the invasion.

In the north, Israel faces Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy that has de facto control over much of Lebanon, with a vast arsenal of missiles aimed at Israeli cities. Iran is reportedly close to nuclear breakout. This is the war with Israel that it wants—on Israeli soil, through once-removed marauding militias. Tehran terrorizes much of the Middle East in this manner.

Any serious response must go through Tehran. If the U.S. and the international community are truly outraged by the scenes of senior citizens gunned down on the street and women and children abducted, they must not only refrain from limiting Israel’s operation in Gaza but resolve to oust the genocidal regime in Tehran. President Biden’s policy has been exactly the opposite. His administration has sought rapprochement with and even allegedly been manipulated by an Iranian influence operation. He has eased sanctions and in recent weeks gave the mullahs $6 billion for the release of American hostages.

Another lesson involves the high cost of Israeli territorial concessions. Until 2005, there were many Jewish communities in Gaza, known as the Gush Katif settlements. Palestinians routinely attacked and attempted to infiltrate them. Israel’s critics claimed the presence of these communities caused conflict. Some Israelis wondered why significant resources should go to protecting these small towns. In 2005, Israel’s army completely withdrew from Gaza and uprooted every Jewish community, even taking the bodies from the cemeteries. Now the whole country faces the danger those communities face, but 100 times worse. The myth that the presence of Jewish communities beyond the 1949 armistice line is the root cause of the conflict has now been firmly disproved. Israel left Gaza voluntarily. Now Gaza comes to Israel, and it is literally dragging Jewish women back there.

Now imagine if those who perpetrated yesterday’s attacks also had control of Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), a vastly larger territory with a much longer, irregularly shaped frontier a few miles from Israel’s main population centers. The consequences would be orders of magnitude worse.

Yet for decades, even as Hamas used the opportunity created by Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza to launch countless attacks against it, the dominant paradigm of Middle East diplomacy has remained the “two-state solution,” which in practice means Israel making greater and more strategically critical territorial withdrawals. Today’s events are a foretaste of what the “two-state solution” would mean.

Palestinian Kremlinology seeks to distinguish the Ramallah-based Fatah faction from its rival Hamas. But once one concedes the notion of a Palestinian state, one can’t decide who runs it forever. Fatah also ruled Gaza when Israel left, until Hamas took power. Hamas could likely prevail in West Bank elections if Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ever held them. Mr. Abbas, who was elected to a four-year term in 2005, responded to Saturday’s pogrom by asserting Palestinians’ right to “self-defense.”

Many in the West don’t take seriously Iran’s or the Palestinian factions’ aspirations to wipe out Israel. Such motives are foreign to them. They see Israel as strong enough to guarantee its security through technology and hard borders—which Saturday’s events show can’t be relied on for the essential security of the people. The Islamists understand that they can’t win through conventional military means. That is why they pose as victims so that Western governments pressure Israel into territorial concessions, which they use as a base to make Israel unlivable.

The gruesome scenes of bloodied Jewish women carted off to Gaza are reminiscent of the recent ISIS reign of terror. Islamists have driven Yazidis, Christians and other minorities from much of the Middle East. It can happen here.

Finally, there is the question of what can be done with Hamas in Gaza. False doctrines of international law have given the terror group an insurance policy: No matter what atrocities they commit against Israel, they will come out of any conflict with no less territory than before. They may lose men, but they gain gruesome honor. Hamas’s war aim isn’t to minimize its own casualties but to drive out the Jews. To defeat and discredit its leadership, the Palestinians must pay a permanent territorial price. Israel is fighting the clearest possible war of self-defense. Its 1967 capture of the Golan Heights buffer zone was legitimate and humiliated the regime of Hafez al-Assad. Israel has every right to annex buffer zones in Gaza permanently.

Israel Declares War on Hamas After Surprise Assault From Gaza,2023-10-07T04:52:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Shayndi Raice', 'Dion Nissenbaum', 'Anas Baba', 'Anat Peled']","TEL AVIV—Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was at war with Hamas after the militant group’s forces poured across the border from Gaza on Saturday, clashing with Israeli forces and pushing into a swath of territory in the south of the country.

The broad Hamas assault caught Israel’s military and security establishment off-guard. Militants invaded by air, land and sea, according to the Israeli military, penetrating at least four military bases along Israel’s border with Gaza.

Saturday evening, Israeli soldiers were fighting to regain control and expel militants from Israeli towns and villages, with four army divisions moving to the country’s south. The Israeli military estimated that 3,500 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israel. Across the country, shaken Israelis sought refuge in safe rooms and bomb shelters. Explosions boomed across Tel Aviv as the country’s Iron Dome air-defense shot down a fusillade of rockets from Gaza on Saturday night, although some fell on the city and injured civilians.

Abu Obeida, the spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing, said the group had abducted dozens of people, including Israeli army officers. He didn’t share the exact number of hostages. “They are all around the Gaza strip,” he said, adding a warning to Israel: “It’s better not to take any irrational decisions.”

The Israeli military said soldiers and civilians had been captured and taken into Gaza, and that most of its casualties weren’t due to rockets but close-contact fighting and “cold-blooded killings” by Hamas. Militants held hostages in at least two Israeli towns, the authorities said. On Sunday morning, Israel’s embassy in Washington said the number of civilians and soldiers captured had reached 100.

“As we’re speaking, the situation in Israel is still not fully under control,” Israel Defense Forces spokesman Jonathan Conricus said in a live briefing on X, formerly Twitter, around 1:30 a.m. Tel Aviv time. He said Israeli soldiers were still going house-to-house in the southern part of the country near Gaza, in an effort to clear the area of a “high number of hundreds” of Hamas militants who crossed over during the day. He didn’t say how many terrorists might remain, although the IDF killed more than 200 so far.

Meanwhile, Israel hit back with airstrikes that it said targeted Hamas leaders and militants.

“What happened today has never been seen before in Israel, and I will make sure it doesn’t happen again,” said Netanyahu in a nighttime address to the nation. “Difficult days are ahead of us, but we will win.”

The prime minister followed up later in the night, posting on X that Israel had started an offensive and “will continue without hesitation and without respite—until the goals are achieved.”

Netanyahu is in discussions with opposition leaders about forming an emergency unity government. The invasion by Hamas comes amid political turmoil in Israel over a plan by Netanyahu and his far-right allies to weaken the country’s Supreme Court.

Around 300 Israelis, mostly civilians, were confirmed dead and 1,864 wounded, according to Israeli authorities. At least 256 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,788 injured in Israeli counterstrikes on Gaza, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.

The broad attacks unleashed at dawn on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah threaten to derail U.S.-brokered talks to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel and come at a time of significant domestic political turmoil and division within Israel.

In Washington, President Biden said he spoke to Netanyahu and told him the U.S. stands ready to offer all appropriate means of support.

“The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza,” he said. “The United States warns against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation. My administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Hamas’s attack also caught the Biden administration by surprise, several senior U.S. civilian and military officials said. These officials said they hadn’t seen any intelligence reports in recent days alerting Washington that the audacious assault was in the works.

The Biden administration said Saturday it was still too early to tell if Iran played a role in the planning of Hamas’s attack, but there was no doubt Tehran has been providing support for Hamas in the form of funding and arms, a senior administration official said. Biden convened his national security team on Saturday to look for ways in which it could assist Israel.

Hamas has called on other Palestinian groups and Arabs more broadly to join its campaign against Israel, saying Saturday’s attacks were just the beginning, raising the specter of a broader conflict. There were limited clashes in the West Bank between Palestinians and Israeli settlers and soldiers.

“We are on the verge of a great victory and clear conquest on the Gaza front,” Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a video.

In neighboring Lebanon, the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah said it was watching the battle play out “with utmost interest” and that it was in direct contact with Gaza’s rulers. “It sends a message to the Arab and Islamic world, and the international community as a whole, especially those seeking normalization with this enemy, that the Palestinian cause is an everlasting one, alive until victory and liberation,” said Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog blamed Iran for coordinating the attack by Hamas, calling on the international community to support Israel in condemning the Palestinians militants and Tehran.

Iran didn’t take responsibility for the attack but Yahya Rahim-Safavi, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, said Iran would stand by the Palestinian fighters until they had liberated Palestine and Jerusalem, according to a statement on the state-run ISNA news agency.

“We congratulate the Palestinian fighters for this operation,” he said.

In response to the attacks, the Israeli military said it launched strikes against 17 military compounds and locations connected to Hamas’s leadership in Gaza. The army released videos of strikes on cars, Palestinian militants and other targets. Dozens of air force jet fighters launched the attacks, the Israeli military said.

The army also flooded southern Israel with ground troops to manage the incursion, it said. The Israeli military said it had named the counteroffensive against Hamas Operation Swords of Iron.

Palestinians in Gaza fled their homes by the thousands in anticipation of Israeli retaliation, seeking shelter in schools.

Some Hamas militants used paragliders to enter Israel as others came by land and sea, said Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman.

Yoni Asher, 37, said his wife, Doron Asher, 34, went missing along with their two daughters, ages 5 and 3, while she was visiting her mother in Nir Oz, an Israeli village near the border with Gaza. He said no one from the military has been in contact with him formally.

“I need help in trying to locate her,” he said. Later Saturday, footage emerged of his wife and children being held by Hamas militants.

Residents in the south said they heard gunshots and were sheltering. “We are in a bad situation,” said Yahaloma Zechut, a resident of Ofakim, a city near the Gaza border.

“During all the previous rounds of fighting I was in the shelters and supporting people but the situation now with infiltration into our homes is unbearable. It is very hard.”

The military called up reservists and braced its citizens for more conflict. It warned residents to stay near bomb shelters and obey orders from authorities. Hecht said that the military would take time to decide how to respond to what he called a “dire situation.”

Videos shared on social media by Israeli news organizations showed cars burning and smoke rising from buildings in the southern city of Ashkelon.

In another southern city near the border, Sderot, Natan Flayer first heard about a group of militants inside his city from his neighborhood WhatsApp group. “The photos started coming in and it was hard to believe but I recognized it was in Sderot,” he said. “Later, photos of bodies started coming in.”

Israeli police said it was dealing with “several rocket impact sites” in Tel Aviv and had sent four injured civilians to the hospital; a Hamas rocket that hit one residential neighborhood left debris on the street and several vehicles and a multistory building damaged, according to a video by Israel’s emergency services organization.

Tensions at the Gaza-Israel border have been heightened in recent weeks, with Palestinians sending incendiary balloons and the Israeli military conducting airstrikes. But there had been no indications that the tensions would break out into full-scale conflict.

Israel’s military has engaged in on-and-off confrontations with Hamas—which the U.S. considers a terrorist organization—since the group took over the Gaza Strip after a violent battle with Fatah, the political group that controls the Palestinian Authority. In May, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza, and Israel exchanged five days of fire before a cease-fire was called.

In recent years, Israel’s strategy in Gaza has been to intermittently attack militant groups but avoid a full-scale war. The last time ground troops entered Gaza was in 2014. In a strategic briefing earlier this month, the Israeli military described the Gaza Strip as being in a state of “stable instability” and said that Israel was able to use a variety of economic tools to help keep the situation calm. Israel has been handing out more permits to Palestinians to work in the country as part of that effort.

Israel-Hamas War Latest news and key analysis on the conflict, selected by the editors"
Unesco Writes Jews Out of Ancient Jericho,2023-09-28T22:11:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Eugene Kontorovich'],"Of all the ways to observe Rosh Hashanah, leave it to the United Nations to do so by negating Jewish history. As Jews welcomed the new year, the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organization convened its World Heritage Committee in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On Sept. 17, the organization voted to designate Tell es-Sultan—Ancient Jericho—as a “World Heritage Site” in the “State of Palestine.” That will undermine Unesco’s stated aim of respectful stewardship and reward the Palestinian Authority for its campaign of archaeological destruction.

According to Unesco, the designation is reserved for places of “outstanding universal value to humanity” that should be “protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.” Ancient Jericho doubtless fits the bill. The site is home to the Battle of Jericho (1400 B.C.), where, the Book of Joshua recounts, Jews fought to enter the land of Israel. Centuries later, it’s where the prophet Elisha purified its waters and, as mentioned in three of the Gospels, Jesus visited. Palaces and burial caves from the Second Temple era can still be found in the town and its vicinity.

Unesco’s document explaining the nomination carefully strips this history of its Jewish connection. The authors avoid any mention of Jews, Israelites, Hebrews, Maccabees and Herodians in recounting Ancient Jericho’s significance. The proposal instead refers to the “Canaanite city-states in Palestine”—a geopolitical term for Judea only later applied to the area by the Romans.

This antagonism is nothing new for Unesco. It admitted Palestine as a member state in 2011, leading the U.S. to cut its funding. Since then, it has approved resolutions denying a Jewish connection to the Temple Mount, Judaism’s holiest site. In 2017 Unesco put the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron—the burial place of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah—on the World Heritage List as a “Palestinian” site.

Such actions are why the U.S. withdrew from Unesco in 2018, citing systematic management problems and “continuing anti-Israel bias.” While bipartisan criticism of Unesco continues in Washington, the Biden administration apparently couldn’t bear not being a member of the Paris-based club. In its fiscal 2023 appropriations bill, Congress granted the State Department the authority to waive restrictions on funding the agency. The U.S. officially rejoined in July, claiming that the organization had reformed itself and praising its supposed “focus on decreasing politicized debate, especially on Middle East issues.”

The Jericho resolution proves the opposite. To earn Unesco’s special designation, a government must demonstrate that it will “safeguard” a site and its archaeological treasures. The Palestinian Authority shows no sign of doing anything of the sort. Its efforts to erase Jewish history on paper are coupled with an even more malign destruction of Jewish history on the ground.

Ancient Jericho is mostly under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, which has had oversight of the grounds for decades. The site and its surroundings include several Jewish antiquities, most notably a sprawling complex of palaces and government buildings built by the Hasmonean kings through the reign of Herod the Great.

On a visit this month, I saw firsthand what their stewardship looks like. The Palestinian Authority hasn’t merely neglected the area’s palaces, synagogues and ritual baths; it’s paved over them. Ancient Jericho is covered with recently constructed concrete private houses, interspersed with piles of garbage. Never mind that under the Oslo Accords the Hasmonean palaces and other sites in Ancient Jericho are explicitly identified as “archaeological” sites of “importance to the Israeli side” that the Palestinians are obligated to “protect and safeguard.” By contrast, the section of the complex under Israeli jurisdiction is meticulously maintained and features signs in Hebrew, English and Arabic.

Ancient Jericho isn’t a one-off. The Palestinian campaign against such sites is part of a pattern playing out throughout Judea and Samaria. As documented by Shomrim al HaNetzach (“Preserving the Eternal”) and Regavim—two Israeli groups dedicated to preserving Jewish archeology and open land—the Palestinian Authority is enabling the construction of a suburban subdivision on top of the 3,200 year-old Joshua’s altar in Samaria.

Also on the tentative list for Unesco’s historical destruction are Har Greizim—the biblical Mount of Blessings—and the Dead Sea Scroll caves, which the Palestinian Authority has asked the agency to recognize as “Palestinian” sites. It’s no surprise that some international institutions want to turn Jewish heritage to dust. But it’s a shame that the U.S. is a party to the demolition. When Congress’s waiver for Unesco funding expires in two years, Washington should let it die.

A Union Railroad Job in Congress,2023-09-21T22:29:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['The Editorial Board'],"It pays to be wary of politicians rushing out legislation after an accident or disaster, and the Railway Safety Act is a classic of the genre. It uses February’s train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, to enact a Big Labor priority.

The bill is courtesy of Ohio’s Senate duo, Democrat Sherrod Brown and Republican J.D. Vance.

Yet the bill’s main provisions are irrelevant to the Ohio rail accident and most others. Instead it maximizes work hours for union laborers and slaps mostly redundant rules on rail carriers.

The biggest union giveaway is a mandate requiring rail carriers with more than $1.032 billion in annual revenue to maintain two-person train crews. That would mean more jobs and longer hours for rail workers, and more dues for the union, but any safety benefit is speculative. The Federal Railroad Administration declined a crew-size mandate in 2019 after finding it would have no effect on safety, and the failed Ohio train had three men aboard. Yet the 12 rail labor unions have sought it for years.

The same goes for the bill’s handling of inspections. It mandates that railcars be inspected by a railroad-certified mechanic instead of a conductor, and it directs the Transportation Department to ban railroads from setting a maximum time limit for inspections. The result will be backed-up trains awaiting inspectors, but no visual check would have caught the heat failure that caused the Ohio derailment.

Sensors beat human eyeballs in detecting malfunctions, as shown in a pair of studies by consulting firm Oliver Wyman in 2015 and 2021. Rail carriers in recent years have focused on developing on-board technology for heat sensing and other common malfunctions, and the mandates will divert money that could finance future breakthroughs.

The biggest carriers already have two-man crews under their collective-bargaining agreements with the rail unions. Midsize carriers often don’t, however, and they would be hit hardest by new costs. Sens. Brown and Vance rushed their bill into draft after the Ohio crash, and they seem not have considered how its rules will burden rail shipping.

Mr. Vance has said he “privately” has enough Republican support to clear the 60-vote Senate filibuster rule. But let’s hope the months since the accident have given other Senators time to consider the merits rather than the easy politics. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer planned to schedule a full vote after the bill cleared the Commerce Committee in May, but only seven Republicans have said they would support it. It would also face a tough hurdle in the GOP-controlled House.

Lawmakers will always be tempted to follow a crisis with new laws they can take credit for, especially when the event is close to home. Yet there’s no excuse for passing an ill-considered law loaded with unnecessary priorities that cater to a political special interest.

Correction: An earlier version misstated details of the Railway Safety Act passed by the Senate Commerce Committee.

"‘Father and Son’ Review: Anchored in Space, Voyaging in Time",2023-09-22T16:03:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Michael O Donnell', 'Jonathan Raban']","On his first night in rehabilitation after a massive stroke at age 68, the writer Jonathan Raban took on a project. “I had long promised myself to read Tony Judt’s ‘Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945’—a long book that covered my own lifetime and a good test of my working brain cells,” Raban writes in his memoir, “Father and Son.” Yet his interest went further than subject matter or mental aerobics. The two British expatriates and contemporaries had something in common. Judt had publicly chronicled his struggle with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, continuing to dictate his work until his death in 2010. Here was an example of intellect unmarred by self-pity or physical limitation. “He puts to shame my own disablement,” Raban writes of Judt, “and reminds me of just how lucky I am to live in writerly solitude on my own terms still.”

Raban’s memoir was likewise written using voice-dictation software and completed over the course of years. Published posthumously following the author’s death this past January from complications of his stroke, the book tells two stories in parallel. The first is Raban’s six-week stay in a Seattle rehabilitation center in 2011. The second is his father Peter Raban’s three-year separation from his wife and infant son while serving as a British army officer during World War II. As full of eloquence as it is free of sentimentality, the memoir is a parting gift from a figure of insight and fierce independence.

Given Raban’s prior renown as a travel writer, his stationary outlook in “Father and Son” is as cruel as an anchored ship. The author of some 18 books, including several novels, he worked in the tradition of Peter Matthiessen, V.S. Naipaul and Paul Theroux. These writers crossed back and forth between fiction and nonfiction and turned their journeys into literature. Raban’s “Bad Land” (1996), about Montana at the turn of the 20th century, won the National Book Critics Circle Award; several of his other travelogues explored America’s waterways by sailboat. Unsurprisingly, the best passages in “Father and Son” convey movement, as when the author recalls a trip through eastern Washington state: “I headed south on a road as true as a line of longitude.”

16 Books We Read This Week A journey through a father’s wartime letters, the making of modern synagogues, a battle over China’s history and more.

This interest in motion drives Peter’s story. It begins with Jonathan at his father’s bedside on the day before Peter died in 1996. The narrative then turns back more than half a century, to Peter’s evacuation at Dunkirk. There followed service in North Africa, then Italy, Palestine and Syria. While tracing this journey, the younger Raban paints a portrait of his father that is critically objective yet humane. The young artillery officer wore his class pretensions stiffly, as when he commented on the pleasant accommodations of his officers’ train. Unremarked by Peter: the enlisted men sleeping fitfully on straw in a cattle car. Raban also writes unsparingly of his father’s petty prejudices and bigotries. Yet Peter’s decency is evident as well: his coolness in action, his willingness to sponsor his men for compassionate leave, and his gentleness to his wife, Monica, as she anxiously awaited her husband’s safe return.

All of this is gleaned through correspondence. Peter and Monica exchanged letters that were passionate, ardent and frank about everything but combat. Their son experienced them as a revelation, so unlike the cheerless notes he received from his father while at boarding school. When writing to his wife, Peter played down the horror of war out of both duty (army censorship) and patronization (she’d fret!). Although he faced ample danger, particularly during the Anzio campaign in Italy, he rarely let on in his letters home.

The younger Raban sets a warm—and exaggerated—tableau of the comforts of the pen during his father’s trench life: “Six feet below ground, working by the light of a storm lantern, the air of his snug burrow smelling of paraffin, freshly turned earth, and St. Bruno Flake pipe smoke, and with a bottle of NAAFI Scotch close to hand, Peter clearly took a writerly pleasure in inhabiting the world created by his own words—a world in which he could spend a blessed hour or two in exile from the war.”

Interspersed with Peter’s story are accounts of Jonathan Raban’s stroke and slow recovery. These chapters convey less motion, but the pages turn quickly because the lines are so raw. The rubble of Judt’s “Postwar” proves an apt metaphor for all that Raban must rebuild in rehabilitation. To say that he is not the ideal patient of the American healthcare system is like saying that a rusted chain dragged across broken glass might offend the ear. He is prickly, observant and blunt; he sneaks in wine and steals a chance to smoke. If there is one thing he cannot abide, it is to be spoken to condescendingly, as when one nurse asks him to “go potty” or another tells him to wash his hands. Raban responds to these insulting remarks with salt and vinegar. “Do you know what the word ‘infantilization’ means?” he asks one nurse, who leaves his room with her nose in the air.

This is a vivid firsthand account of the indignities of rehabilitation: its institutional food, forced smiles, lack of privacy and petty humiliations, with each therapist looking “young, trim, impersonal, like a curator” of patients. Yet Raban would come to find the physical and occupational therapists to be his allies. Working one-on-one with them for extended sessions produces conversation and friendship, whereas revolving nurses regard “patients as an undifferentiated class.” This observation likely reflects Raban’s personality or his unique experience and is not at all fair to the nursing profession. Yet his portrayals of Richard, the urbane staff member who declares “Happy Bloomsday” in honor of James Joyce, or Kelli, the kind and encouraging physical therapist who agrees to read David Foster Wallace on Raban’s recommendation, undoubtedly reveal the best of Raban’s stay.

What links the two disparate narratives—the father dying near the beginning of the book and the son just after the end? Raban does not say, but his prose and the memoir’s structure offer a clue. As he tries to quantify the cognitive effects of his stroke, he writes, “I’ve now spent more than eleven years asking myself two questions every writing day: What have I lost? and Am I fooling myself?” It occurs to the reader of this remarkable book that both queries apply to the death of a parent as much as to medical recovery. How to reckon with the magnitude of such a loss? Are those who have endured it deceiving themselves that life can go on as before? These questions are so haunting that they are not asked directly. Not even a writer as wise as Jonathan Raban had the answers.

Union Pacific Draws Safety Regulator’s Ire After Worker Furloughs,2023-09-21T15:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Esther Fung'],"Jim Vena came to helm

The Omaha, Neb.-based freight railroad recently furloughed 138 rail-yard workers, drawing the ire of the Federal Railroad Administration, the industry’s safety regulator.

U.S. railroads are confronting a drop in cargo this year that is testing their staffing strategies. It is a reversal for an industry that not long ago was struggling to find enough workers to keep all their trains running.

The FRA said its recent inspection of outbound trains at a Union Pacific yard in North Platte, Neb., showed the rates of defects in freight cars and locomotives were twice the national average. That raises the question, FRA Administrator Amit Bose wrote in a letter this month to Union Pacific, if it was “a result of not having the personnel to make the necessary repairs because of the recent furloughs.”

Vena responded that Union Pacific will never compromise on the safety of its employees and communities. “There is no correlation between recent furloughs and Union Pacific’s ability to address mechanical repairs,” Vena wrote in a letter to the FRA.

andhave said that they don’t plan to furlough workers the way they would during past industry downturns. Earlier in the pandemic, when demand rebounded, railroads said they struggled to rehire workers whom they had earlier furloughed. This led the companies to turn away business as they struggled with poor service levels.

Training a new conductor typically takes six months, and leaders at Norfolk and CSX said it is more economical to retain train crew and send them for additional training during periods of low volume.

Union Pacific said that the recent furloughs were in response to lower business volumes and resulting equipment storage and that the moves affected less than 4% of the company’s mechanical craft employees. The company also said it has a supplementary work and training program in place for train crew.

A Union Pacific spokeswoman said that the railroad operator is hiring in other areas where there are shortages, and that some affected employees are considering pursuing other openings in the company. The railroad operator had 32,060 employees at the end of June 30, up 4% from the same period a year earlier.

Vena said in his letter to the FRA that the regulator’s recent investigation involved 1% of the overall Union Pacific fleet and that the company’s locomotive fleet is safe to operate.

Vena, a proponent of precision scheduled railroading, was chief operating officer at Union Pacific from 2019 to 2020. He previously worked for more than 40 years at

. A New York hedge fund pushed for Vena to succeed Lance Fritz, Union Pacific’s former CEO, arguing that the company had underperformed under Fritz’s leadership.

Since the February derailment of a Norfolk Southern freight train in East Palestine, Ohio, that released toxic chemicals, there has been heavier scrutiny on railroads’ safety efforts. Labor unions have said staffing cutbacks in recent years have affected the depth of inspections and training for new workers. Railroads say their investments in technology including those that identify defects have resulted in better safety outcomes compared with human inspections.

Railroad operators have to constantly evaluate their resources against volume, which is subject to the vagaries of economic cycles. In the first eight months this year, U.S. railroads moved 4.9% fewer carloads, containers and trailers than they did in the same period a year earlier, according to data from the Association of American Railroads.

Weak volumes have prompted railroads to slow their hiring. A 17-month streak of gains in train and engine workers came to an end in July, but picked up again in August, according to railroads’ data submissions to the Surface Transportation Board and

’s estimates. The economic regulator has placed pressure on freight railroads to improve service, saying their cost-cutting caused shipping bottlenecks.

BNSF, which competes with Union Pacific in the Western half of the country, said it doesn’t plan to furlough workers. Where some locations are overstaffed, BNSF said it is pulling forward engineer-training programs and deploying temporary transfers across its agriculture network where it anticipates a good harvest.

CSX says it can manage its staff levels through attrition and can pause hiring if needed. “There’s a lot of ways to manage costs,” said CSX Chief Executive Joe Hinrichs in a recent investor conference. “I’m here to remind ourselves that there’s nothing in precision scheduled railroading that says you should optimize your manpower for the low point of the cycle.”

Biden Appoints Disaster Coordinator for Recovery Efforts in Ohio Train Derailment,2023-09-20T23:04:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Ken Thomas In Washington', 'Esther Fung In New York', 'In Washington', 'In New York']","President Biden issued an executive order Wednesday appointing a federal disaster coordinator to oversee long-term recovery efforts following the fiery derailment of a

The executive order, arriving more than seven months after the accident devastated the small Ohio town near the Pennsylvania state line, will direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to name a coordinator to oversee a comprehensive assessment of any unmet needs that haven’t been addressed by Norfolk Southern and would qualify for federal assistance.

This order stops short of a federal disaster declaration, which would have enabled local authorities to access federal programs from FEMA. The Biden administration said the disaster declaration request from Ohio will remain open and if FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell “receives new information from the state, including needs that are not being addressed by Norfolk Southern, she will immediately submit a recommendation on whether a major disaster declaration is warranted.”

Norfolk Southern said it remains committed to covering all costs associated with the cleanup at East Palestine.

“We have made significant progress, keeping our promises to safely and thoroughly clean the derailment site, support the needs of the community, and invest in its future,” said Thomas Crosson, a spokesman for the railroad operator. “We remain committed to East Palestine today, and into the future, and will continue to work closely with federal, state and local leaders.”

Norfolk Southern has said it will add more trackside sensors and review its safety operations, and it has pledged to provide funds for long-term medical costs and reimburse homeowners near the site who sell their homes for less than the property’s appraised value before the derailment.

Norfolk Southern has estimated that its response to the derailment will cost more than $800 million, including removing all the hazardous chemicals, helping the community rebuild and responding to lawsuits connected to the accident. The railroad has reopened both of its tracks in the area, but the cleanup is still under way.

The Ohio attorney general’s office is negotiating an agreement with Norfolk Southern that would create a long-term fund to compensate homeowners along with other funds to pay for health problems or water contamination issues in the area.

The National Transportation Safety Board has said 38 cars derailed and a fire damaged an additional dozen train cars. Residents on both sides of the Ohio-Pennsylvania border were ordered to evacuate their homes because of the derailment and the release of toxic chemicals.

Biden’s order also directs the Environmental Protection Agency, which has been removing contaminated soil and wastewater from the site, to submit a report to the president on the status of air, soil and water monitoring and Norfolk Southern’s response. The executive order also calls for separate reports on public-health testing and any actions the Transportation Department is taking in response to the derailment.

Biden has said he will visit the Ohio community but he has yet to make the trip. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this month that Biden “will go to East Palestine. He promised that he would, and he will.”

The Oslo Accords Began Israel’s Folly With the Palestinians,2023-09-18T22:07:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Amir Avivi'],"Barbara W. Tuchman opens her iconic 1984 book, “The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam,” with Rehoboam, who caused the Kingdom of Israel to splinter into Judah and Israel. If Tuchman were writing today, she might have ended it with another wretched chapter from the history of Israel—the great folly of Oslo.

Tuchman defines folly as the pursuit by government of policies contrary to its own interests, whose adverse effects are apparent in real time, with the availability of feasible alternatives. The perpetrators are a group, not a single ruler, whose leadership spans longer than a generation. Israel’s implementation of the Oslo Accords, which were signed 30 years ago this month, meets all her criteria.

The folly of Oslo lies not in the creation of Palestinian autonomy (or as Yitzhak Rabin repeatedly called it, “less than a state”), which was part of the peace agreement Menachem Begin forged between Israel and Egypt. This idea was popular in Israel. But the decision to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization, a bloodthirsty terror organization devoted to the destruction of Israel, was an act of sheer folly. Viable alternatives existed, first and foremost local leaders in the Arab cities in Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip.

In the days between the 1991 Gulf War and Oslo, PLO leader Yasser Arafat was a regional outcast because of his support for Saddam Hussein against the American-led Arab coalition. His prestige and the PLO’s suffered greatly. Yet Israel allowed Arafat to become a global player and even furnished him with weapons.

The implementation of the Oslo Accords in 1994 began with the Israel Defense Forces’ withdrawal from city centers in Gaza and redeployment around Israeli communities. Arafat and the PLO immediately started building a domestic military industry to produce rockets, explosives and mortars and to dig tunnels. In seven years, Gaza went from the stone age to firing rockets, in what may be the fastest military transformation in the modern age. The adverse effects of the Oslo Accords were abundantly clear. Israel saw them and could have responded but didn’t. I remember trying to wrap my head around this inaction as a young major in the IDF while building fortifications around Israeli communities in Gaza.

Rather than reassess, the Israeli government decided to expand the folly, withdrawing Israeli troops from Palestinian cities in Judea and Samaria as well. We military professionals on the ground weren’t surprised when the Palestinians created hundreds of explosives workshops there. Israel soon faced an unprecedented wave of suicide murderers and other terrorists. To restore security, Israel was forced to reconquer the city centers through Operation Defensive Shield, after more than 1,000 Israeli civilians had been murdered by terrorists across the country. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon exacerbated the situation further in 2005, when he unilaterally and unconditionally withdrew Israeli troops and settlements from Gaza, allowing a failed terror state to sprout in our backyard.

How miserable was Oslo? Research from the Israel Defense and Security Forum shows that Israeli civilian casualties resulting from terror attacks increased ninefold in the years following the accords’ implementation (1994-2022) compared with the years since Israel’s founding (1948-93). But those tragic deaths aren’t the whole story.

The sad truth is that Israel unwittingly allowed the creation of a global terrorist network that directs international efforts to challenge Israel’s legitimacy and fuels anti-Semitism. The Arab citizens of Israel are now subject to intense Palestinian propaganda, while international funds provided to the Palestinian Authority support terror activities and the gradual takeover of Judea and Samaria. Palestinian curriculum is rife with Israel hatred, creating generations of future terrorists and diminishing the prospects of future peace.

The idea behind the Oslo Accords might have been noble, but the implementation was deeply flawed. I hope that after Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat’s 87-year-old successor, passes from the scene, conditions will allow a new and positive path forward, for the sake of Israelis and Palestinians alike.

Turkish Citizenship Is a Hot Commodity,2023-09-08T17:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Kristin Surak'],"In the Western world, the idea of citizenship is usually celebrated for its promise of equality. Even in societies divided by class and status, citizenship enables disadvantaged segments of the population to obtain basic rights. Yet access to citizenship itself remains fundamentally unequal. No matter the country, governments screen entry into their territories to move the connected, the talented and the wealthy to the head of the line, while those deemed less worthy are left waiting on the doorstep. In the face of these barriers, many people act strategically by acquiring a second citizenship, to increase their possibilities and hedge risks.

Citizenship by investment (CBI) programs are an increasingly popular way for wealthy people to acquire citizenship in another country in exchange for a defined financial contribution. To qualify, an applicant makes a donation to a government fund or invests in an approved channel, typically real estate, businesses or bonds. Permanent residence is often unnecessary, or else reduced to bureaucratic box-ticking. Indeed, some countries do not require naturalizers to ever visit.

A decade ago, the market for citizenship was dominated by island microstates. Those that can offer “top tier” citizenships—like Malta, whose citizens also become citizens of the European Union—may ask for more than $1 million for the privilege. Others, like small countries in the Caribbean, may expect as little as $100,000. Since 2019, however, Turkey—a true nation-state—has come to dominate this global market and now accounts for around half of all CBI naturalizations, a stunning rise.

By 2020, 5,100 new Turkish citizens had brought $1.7 billion into the country.

By 2020, Turkey had naturalized over 5,100 investors and their families. An additional 380 were waiting for their documents, and up to 9,000 more applications were in processing. Not only were the application numbers big, the investment ones were as well. The 5,100 new citizens had brought $1.7 billion to the country, and those in the waiting room would deliver over $400 million more. The interior minister estimated that the pending applications together would garner an additional $2.7 billion. By June 2020, the program averaged over 1,300 approvals per month. More recent numbers are unavailable, but since Turkey is one of the few CBI countries that still naturalizes Russian citizens, it’s likely that the figure remains high.

Ankara rolled out the scheme in 2016 to boost the economy as Turkey’s housing and construction sectors flagged. Initially, an applicant was required to put at least $1 million into property, $2 million into a business, or $3 million into government bonds or a bank; he or she could naturalize after holding the asset for three years. Alternatively, an investor could employ 100 Turkish citizens. The offering was straightforward, but at first only 70 people applied, most of them already living in the country. The problem was that the price was high, comparable to that of Malta and Cyprus, but Turkey didn’t have what the two microstates could offer: EU citizenship.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should citizenship be available on the basis of investing in a country? Join the conversation below.

Two years later, the Turkish government lowered the minimum investment amount. Now citizenship could be obtained with a bank deposit, business investment or government bond purchase of $500,000, or a property investment of just $250,000—the cost of a nice house in Istanbul. At a time when the lira was seeing 20% inflation, bringing dollars into the country seemed like a solid money-maker, and the program took off. Turkey reportedly received 250 applications in the first seven months of its relaunched program.

Investors from Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Egypt showed the greatest interest at first, several service providers told me. Many were wealthy people who moved to or at least set up a base in Turkey in order to escape political turmoil or pressure at home. Before long foreign residents of Dubai were showing interest, as well as investors from Russia and Pakistan. Turkey was a serious economy right in their backyard, and becoming a citizen there could facilitate business transactions in the Middle East. By the 2020s, the Chinese were getting on board as well, attracted by rock-bottom real estate prices that were appreciating by 20% a year. As one lawyer in Istanbul put it, people who were buying real estate before “are just getting citizenship on top now.”

There are some drawbacks to Turkey’s program, but the country offers workarounds. Turkish citizenship doesn’t bring automatic entry into the EU’s passport-free Schengen zone, but since the country is a member of the European Union Association, its citizens can apply for a long-term multi-entry visa with relative speed and ease. While Turkish citizens are required to perform military service, those living abroad receive exemptions, and others can serve just 14 to 21 days if they pay the government $7,000.

And Turkey offers an extra prize. The country boasts a treaty with the U.S. that allows its citizens to apply for an E2 residence permit in order to run an enterprise. Applicants need only to capitalize a business—about $200,000 usually suffices—to acquire a permit that covers their whole family. The E2 permit must be renewed and doesn’t lead to permanent-resident status, but that’s a plus for many wealthy people, since permanent residence would bring them under the U.S. tax net for life. Until Brexit, the U.K. offered a similar side door to residence via the Turkish Businessperson visa. The popularity of this perk was clear, with applications exploding from almost 800 in 2018 to nearly 3,000 in 2019.

Turkey represents a shift in the citizenship industry away from microstates, where investor citizens spend little to no time, toward bigger countries with bigger economies. “It has livability,” as one lawyer put it, before rattling off the high-end neighborhoods and restaurants, as well as attractive business possibilities. “You can have a real life. A driver costs only $1,000 per month.” Another service provider explained that Turkey appeals to Middle Easterners is because it’s close to home, easy to access, and livable. “With a Turkish passport, you can’t go to the U.K. or the EU,” she observed, “but in comparison to an Iraqi or Syrian passport, it’s very good.”

In addition, Turkey appears to be more resilient against external pressure than other countries. Unusually for a major program, it doesn’t prohibit applications from citizens of countries on U.S. travel-ban or sanctions lists, including Iran and Iraq. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Turkey didn’t fall into line with EU demands to ban Russians from the CBI program, as did Malta and the Caribbean countries. Notably, Turkey does a lot for the EU: For a cool 6 billion euros from Brussels, it houses over three million refugees who might otherwise seek shelter in Europe. The EU may be reluctant to pressure a neighboring state that has done so much to keep asylum seekers at bay.

The number of investor citizens is minuscule in comparison to the foreign population of Turkey as a whole. The country currently hosts about a thousand refugees for each wealthy naturalizer it accepts. Yet as a proportion of the global CBI market, the number is huge and likely only to grow.

Demand for programs like Turkey’s will persist as long as countries continue to produce wealthy citizens looking to improve their mobility or opportunities, or for an insurance policy against their own government. The shift from microstates to bigger countries is likely to accelerate as the trend toward deglobalization transforms the CBI landscape, leading people to look for ways to guarantee access should countries delink or seal themselves off into regional blocs. And supply is unlikely to falter as states with limited revenue sources turn to this source of easy money, particularly when other economic streams dry up.

Texas May Execute a Man Based on a Scrapped Medical Theory,2023-09-07T22:02:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['John Grisham'],"For a parent, nothing is worse than the death of a child. Imagine the horror, though, of being falsely accused and wrongly convicted of killing your child.

Twenty years ago, prosecutors in Anderson County, Texas, relied on a now-discredited hypothesis about “shaken baby syndrome” to convict Robert Roberson of the capital murder of his chronically sick 2-year-old daughter Nikki. Countless caregivers have been prosecuted since British pediatrician Norman Guthkelch first posited in the early 1970s that shaking a baby could cause brain bleeding and even death. Many have been convicted and sent to prison, a few even to death row. Mr. Roberson could be the first to be executed. Texas may execute an innocent man.

Mr. Roberson has autism and was a special-education student before dropping out of school in the ninth grade. He had his challenges in life, including past drug addiction that had prompted convictions for writing a hot check and burglary. But he loved being a father to Nikki.

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

She, too, had her challenges. Child Protective Services forced Nikki’s mother to give her up at birth. Nikki suffered from chronic and severe middle-ear infections. In late January 2002, she had a high fever and undiagnosed pneumonia. Mr. Roberson put Nikki to bed but awoke later and found her on the floor. Mr. Roberson told police that Nikki didn’t appear to have any injuries. She was awake and talking as he tried to soothe her. Father and daughter managed to get back to sleep, but the next morning Nikki was unresponsive. Mr. Roberson brought her to an emergency room in Palestine, Texas. He told hospital staff that she had fallen out of bed, but they didn’t believe him. They didn’t know he was autistic and decided he didn’t show the proper emotions given the dire situation. Doctors transferred Nikki to a children’s hospital in Dallas, but it was too late. She died on Feb. 2.

Mr. Roberson was distraught but his nightmare was only beginning. The Anderson County District Attorney’s Office accused him of killing Nikki and sought the death penalty.

The deck was stacked against Mr. Roberson from the beginning. Accepted medical wisdom at the time was that any child with a triad of symptoms like Nikki’s—brain bleeding, brain swelling and bleeding in the eyes—had been violently shaken or hit against a surface, absent evidence of some other massive trauma such as a car accident or a multistory fall. The medical consensus viewed the presence of the triad to be diagnostic and considered the caregiver the culprit.

In a rush to judgment that is the hallmark of wrongful convictions, one doctor’s hunch about Nikki’s death led to Mr. Roberson’s arrest for murder. Even Mr. Roberson’s court-appointed lawyer agreed this was a “classic” shaken-baby case because, 20 years ago, the triad was considered diagnostic.

Astonishingly, a nurse claimed to law enforcement—and later in front of the jury—that Nikki had been sexually abused, even though no doctor endorsed that belief and there was no autopsy or crime scene evidence of it. The judge allowed the nurse’s testimony and prosecutors’ argument that Mr. Roberson was the kind of person capable of violently shaking a child to death. The jury agreed.

Dr. Guthkelch eventually became distressed at the aggressive misuse of his work by prosecutors. “I am frankly quite disturbed that what I intended as a friendly suggestion for avoiding injury to children has become an excuse for imprisoning innocent people,” he said in 2012 while arguing that convictions like Mr. Roberson’s should be reviewed. “We went badly off the rails.”

Slowly, belatedly, things are changing. Courts in 17 states have exonerated people convicted decades ago of murder or child abuse based on the outdated shaken-baby hypothesis. In 2016, days before Mr. Roberson was set to die, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals returned his case to the trial court for an exhaustive 10-day hearing. Mr. Roberson’s legal team presented six experts who showed that the outdated version of shaken-baby syndrome used at his trial has been discredited and that Nikki died as a result of her undiagnosed pneumonia, medications and accidental fall.

To overturn his conviction, Mr. Roberson’s lawyers had to accomplish two things. First, they had to show that the science used to convict him was wrong (or that the understanding of that science had changed since his trial). Second, they needed to demonstrate that the original jury wouldn’t have convicted him if it knew then what we know now about the shaken-baby syndrome hypothesis. Mr. Roberson’s legal team did more than those two things: It produced unrebutted evidence that no homicide had in fact occurred.

Mr. Roberson’s lawyers presented a 302-page document to the court that comprehensively summarized the new evidence from the experts. Anderson County prosecutors submitted a 17-page brief that hardly touched on the new science—instead rehashing outdated evidence and theories from the original trial in 2003. Mr. Roberson’s lawyers were surprised at the paltry offering. They were flabbergasted when Judge Deborah Evans rubber-stamped it, following the prosecution’s lead in ignoring most of the new expert testimony and all of the scientific studies showing a change in understanding of shaken-baby syndrome. Instead, the trial court’s recommendation cited the same trial testimony that had been challenged as wholly inconsistent with contemporary scientific understanding.

We expect our courts to weigh the evidence before them carefully and thoughtfully. But in Mr. Roberson’s case, and in a shocking number of wrongful convictions, judges simply agree with prosecutors and protect bad convictions despite overwhelming evidence of innocence. We should demand more from judges than a copy-and-paste job that entirely ignores changes in the scientific understanding of a case, especially when a life is on the line.

Nikki’s death was a tragedy, not a crime. Robert Roberson may be out of options unless the U.S. Supreme Court decides to hear his case.

"In New Step Toward Israel Deal, Saudi Arabia Offers to Resume Palestinian Authority Funding",2023-08-29T18:52:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Dion Nissenbaum', 'Summer Said']","Saudi Arabia is offering to resume financial support to the Palestinian Authority, said Saudi officials and former Palestinian officials familiar with the discussions, a sign that the kingdom is making a serious effort to overcome obstacles to establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.

Saudi officials say they are trying to secure Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ’s support for open ties with Israel, providing more legitimacy to any eventual agreement and forestalling any accusations that the kingdom would sacrifice Palestinian efforts to establish an independent state to advance its own goals. Recognizing Israel is especially sensitive for Saudi Arabia because it hosts Islam’s holiest sites, giving it a special status in the Muslim world, where Palestinian statehood remains an emotional rallying cry.

The Saudi outreach has fueled a debate among Palestinian leaders about whether to back the kingdom’s outreach to Israel—a move that would represent a significant shift from officials who accused Gulf leaders of stabbing them in the back when they established diplomatic ties with Israel in 2020.

To advance their interests, the Palestinian Authority is sending a senior delegation to Saudi Arabia next week to discuss what the kingdom can do in talks with Israel to advance flickering hopes of creating a Palestinian state, the officials said.

Saudi Arabia has been a staunch supporter and benefactor of the Palestinians since 1948, when Arab leaders launched an unsuccessful war to prevent the creation of Israel. The kingdom has pumped more than $5 billion dollars into Palestinian causes, including direct support to the Palestinian Authority. But Riyadh began cutting back funding to the Palestinian Authority in 2016 amid allegations of incompetence and corruption, with aid plunging from $174 million a year in 2019 to zero in 2021.

Now, resumption of Saudi funding to the Palestinians could play an important role in securing their support for the kingdom’s outreach to Israel.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first raised the idea of funding with Abbas at a meeting in Saudi Arabia in April, connecting the resumption of aid to the authority cracking down on militant groups and violence in the West Bank, according to Saudis and Palestinians briefed on the talks.

Militant groups hold more power than Palestinian security forces in some cities, and Israel has responded to the rise in Palestinian attacks with repeated military operations. More than 200 Palestinians, many of them militants, and nearly 30 Israelis, almost all civilians, have been killed this year, in what the United Nations said is already the highest recorded annual death toll since the end of the second Palestinian uprising in 2005.

If Abbas can get security under control, the crown prince offered assurances that the kingdom would eventually resume its funding for the Palestinian Authority and that Saudi Arabia wouldn’t accept any deal with Israel that undermines efforts to create an independent Palestinian state, the officials said.

Reducing West Bank violence would represent an important step toward the broader goal of Saudi-Israeli normalization. If the Palestinian Authority can get a handle on militancy, it would demonstrate its ability to govern an independent state that wouldn’t pose a threat to Israel. It would also allow Israeli forces to scale back deadly military operations in the West Bank that have hurt their image across the region and hampered their ability to forge new relationships with Arab neighbors.

While the Saudi proposal wasn’t explicitly tied to Palestinian support for a Saudi-Israel diplomatic deal, the offer provides Palestinians with more incentives to back the kingdom’s efforts, the officials said.

In recent months, the Palestinian Authority has begun trying to reassert control in cities like Jenin, where militant groups had taken effective control, making it a target of frequent Israeli military raids.

Several Palestinian Authority officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Palestinian leaders were blindsided by the Abraham Accords, which opened diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan in 2020. As part of that Trump administration-brokered deal, Israel suspended plans to annex parts of the West Bank, providing limited relief from continued Israeli settlement expansion on land once expected to be part of a Palestinian state.

At the time, Abbas accused the U.A.E. of stabbing the Palestinian people in the back. Emirati leaders said the deal had preserved chances for creation of a Palestinian state by staving off Israeli annexation of West Bank land.

Getting Palestinian support is one of a thicket of challenges facing any Saudi-Israel deal, including the fast-approaching U.S. presidential campaign and resistance from Israeli leaders and U.S. lawmakers wary of giving the kingdom help developing a nuclear program and more military aid.

Some Abbas advisers want the Palestinian leadership to provide the Saudis with plausible concessions they could ask of Israel that would advance efforts to create a Palestinian state.

“Saudi-Palestinian relations are strong, and we have confidence in them,” Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said earlier this month.

“We would like very much to listen to the Saudis, to coordinate with the Saudis and to see how we can endorse and strengthen the position of the Saudis when it comes to this particular matter, and how the Saudis could hear from us about the steps that they should undertake as necessary steps in order for the question of Palestine to be resolved,” he said.

Palestinians who support active cooperation with the Saudis say they want to ensure that the Saudis don’t trade away their concerns to advance the kingdom’s more important interests.

“It’s much easier to bypass the Palestinians when you call the Saudis backstabbers,” said one Palestinian. “It’s more difficult when you cooperate.”

Other Palestinian officials are wary of being betrayed by Saudi leaders who have barely concealed their dim view of the Palestinian Authority’s leadership.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What might be the implications if Saudi Arabia resumes financial support for the Palestinian Authority? Join the conversation below.

In their recent talks, Mohammed assured Abbas that he wouldn’t bend in his support for the Saudi-led Arab Peace Initiative. In that 2002 proposal, the Arab League agreed to establish open ties with Israel only when it allowed the creation of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.

With the Gaza Strip run by the rival Palestinian group Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, and East Jerusalem annexed by Israel, meeting that bar right now appears unattainable. That makes it unlikely Mohammed would hold firm to such an expansive demand if he hopes to secure a deal with Israel soon. Saudi leaders have told U.S. officials that they expect Palestinians to accept concessions short of statehood and that the Palestinians won’t have any power to veto a Saudi-Israel deal.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long suggested that Saudi Arabia cares little about the Palestinians and that he won’t have to agree to anything that advances the realistic prospects for an independent Palestinian state. Saudi leaders have insisted publicly that they will accept nothing less than what is in the Arab Peace Initiative. If it secures a deal with Israel that doesn’t achieve that, Saudi Arabia is expected to continue to support the initiative’s goals, just as the Emiratis did in 2020 when they normalized relations.

Media Lets Biden Off the Hook on Maui Wildfires,2023-08-24T19:24:00Z,Wall Street Journal,[],"The comparison of what Presidents Biden and Bush did or didn’t do in the wake of the Maui fires and Hurricane Katrina is one thing (“Biden Could Learn From Bush After Katrina” by Tevi Troy , op-ed, Aug. 22).

Regulators Gone Wild,2023-08-14T22:46:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['The Editorial Board'],"The Supreme Court has reined in some of the Biden Administration’s regulatory excesses, but the federal bureaucracy is relentless. And now the White House is quietly changing its analytical methods to make it easier to impose new rules while disguising their cost. If you think regulation has been running amok in the last two years, buckle up.

That’s the meaning of the update to what Beltway wonks call the “circular,” which is guidance from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that tells federal agencies how to calculate regulatory costs. The guidance is meant to protect taxpayers by requiring that any proposed regulation justify its cost, based on standard criteria. OMB’s regulatory shop was established to be a check on agencies that want to extend their power willy-nilly regardless of cost.

Now even that guardrail is coming off. In April President Biden issued an executive order instructing OMB to “modernize the regulatory process.” By “modernize” he means remove restraints.

Under Mr. Biden’s order, a “significant regulatory action” is redefined as one expected to have a $200 million annual economic cost, up from $100 million currently. The cost side is then subjected to accounting gimmickry that reduces the apparent impact on the U.S. economy and society.

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue

OMB also tips the benefit side of the cost-benefit ledger by allowing consideration of the “global effects of the regulation,” not merely how new rules affect Americans. That’s right. A perceived benefit for the world can figure into the analysis of a new rule as much as the cost to the people of, say, East Palestine, Ohio. This is intended to be a particular green light for new climate regulation.

All of this doesn’t make headlines but it will have a bigger impact than nearly everything Congress does. One of the casualties will be the states that are the subject of rules, and the guidance rewrite is drawing fire from 26 state Attorneys General who say the revision “turns federalism on its head.” In a letter to OMB, the AGs write that the new rule will “decrease the utility of cost-benefit analysis while increasing the power and flexibility of federal regulators.”

The letter says the revisions will also “encroach on traditional areas of State concern” by claiming that State governments are not “effectively addressing the issues at hand.” The Administration is “attempting to manipulate the regulatory process,” the AGs add, by “adjusting the discount rate and adjusting the time horizon of regulatory analysis” so the presumed benefits of progressive regulations seem to trump costs.

By lowering the discount rate, the Administration can make hoped-for benefits that might occur years in the future weigh more heavily against the present regulatory costs. The new draft would also grant the executive branch wider authority for regulations “promoting distributional fairness and advancing equity.”

***

The Biden Administration has already unleashed more regulatory costs on the economy than any in recent memory—even the Obama Administration. Mr. Biden first repealed the Trump Administration rule that for every new regulation, two had to be repealed.

Then his regulators went wild. Casey Mulligan, a University of Chicago economist, recently looked at the Biden rules through 2022 and said the overall cost is $5,019 per household. That’s 15% more than the $4,353 cost per household during a comparable period in the Obama Administration. The Trump Administration had reduced regulatory costs by $2,636.

According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Clyde Wayne Crews, the Biden Administration has 297 “economically significant” regulations in the pipeline, and his average has been 97 per year compared to an average of 69 a year for Mr. Obama and 49 for George W. Bush. That number will appear to fall if Mr. Biden raises the bar for economically significant regulations to $200 million, which is part of the point.

But don’t be fooled. Mr. Biden is setting new records as the super regulator in chief, and all of us will pay for it.

Norfolk Southern Doubles Ohio Derailment Cost to Over $800 Million,2023-07-27T14:12:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Esther Fung'],"Further legal costs, fines and penalties related to the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment are possible, Norfolk Southern said.

The updated cost forecast Thursday was more than double the estimate that the Atlanta-based railroad operator provided earlier this year.

Executives said that the bulk of the costs are from the environmental cleanup, and added that there might be additional legal costs, fines and penalties in the coming quarters. These are difficult to estimate, they said.

“This is going to take a little bit more time,” said Mark George, chief financial officer of Norfolk Southern, during an earnings conference call. “We’ve got a lot more visibility now than we did in [the first quarter].”

On Feb. 3, dozens of railcars, including some tankers carrying hazardous materials, derailed in East Palestine, just miles from the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. The accident spawned a complex cleanup and environmental-monitoring effort that involves local, state and federal agencies.

George said that the company expects cleanup activity to continue into October, and then moderate after that. So far, the company said it has paid $287 million in derailment-related costs.

Norfolk Southern said it is making claims from its insurance policies and seeking recoveries from other parties.

In late June, the company sued a number of parties in federal court, including the chemical shipper and the owners of railcars that derailed. Federal transportation-safety investigators have said an overheated wheel bearing on a railcar was the likely cause of the derailment. The complaint “seeks to ensure that others responsible for the safe transport of their railcars and their chemicals contribute resources to the effort.”

In the most recent quarter, Norfolk’s profit from railway operations fell by more than half to $576 million from the prior year.

Revenue dropped 8% to $3 billion, missing analysts’ expectations of $3.1 billion, Norfolk Southern added.

"As Cleanup of Ohio Train Derailment Slogs Along, Residents Still Feel Unsafe",2023-07-24T12:00:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Kris Maher', 'Photographs Dustin Franz For The Wall Street Journal']","EAST PALESTINE, Ohio—Rick Tsai suits up in chest waders and a full-face respirator to track the iridescent sheen in a creek that snakes through downtown.

Tsai, a chiropractor who has acquired the nickname “Creek Ranger,” regularly posts videos online of himself in the creek to remind the world that things still aren’t right in East Palestine. He takes a pole and scrapes the bottom of Sulphur Run. A swirl of chemicals rises to the surface.

“There’s something in that water that will make you ill, if you’re there too long,” says Tsai, who believes he has gotten rashes and vertigo from visiting the creek. He and his wife, Tammy Tsai, now plan to move from their home, tucked away in a peaceful spot with a garden and koi pond 2 miles from downtown, to another property 10 miles away.

Rick Tsai, a chiropractor, agitated the creek bed of Sulphur Run to check if chemicals are still present in the waterway on July 22. Chemicals left over from the Norfolk Southern train derailment last February appear to still be present in Sulphur Run creek. Tammy and Rick Tsai plan to move from their home to another property 10 miles away.

train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed Feb. 3 along a stretch of homes and businesses here, the cleanup effort goes on with no end in sight , casting a lingering cloud over the town’s future.

Trucks still pass through town day and night hauling away contaminated water and soil from the derailment site. Contractors have removed about 25 million gallons of wastewater and 80,000 tons of contaminated soil. Norfolk Southern has spent $63 million to support the community, including about $18 million to reimburse families for housing, food and other expenses. But the railroad and federal officials haven’t yet charted a course for cleaning up Sulphur Run, showing much is left to be done.

The derailment dealt a major blow to this village of nearly 5,000 on the border with Pennsylvania. Cars that were flung from the tracks caught fire. Three days later, the intentional burning of vinyl chloride from five tanker cars sent a plume of black smoke and more chemicals into the sky.

“From the beginning, we’ve been clear that we would be in town for the long haul,” said Connor Spielmaker, a Norfolk Southern spokesman. “We don’t have a timeline to provide as far as when it’ll be ‘job done,’ but we will be there until it is.”

Earlier this month, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked President Biden to issue a major disaster declaration order, allowing the federal government to continue to pay for the cleanup in case Norfolk Southern ceases to do so. No decision has been made, according to a spokesman for the governor.

In an April financial filing, the company estimated legal and cleanup costs from the accident would be at least $387 million. Earlier this month, Norfolk Southern sued seven other companies that owned railcars carrying hazardous chemicals that were involved in the accident, to share in those costs.

Sulphur Run creek snakes through the village.

The Environmental Protection Agency says it is safe for residents to return to their homes.

The Environmental Protection Agency, which since the derailment set up an office in downtown East Palestine near a dog groomer, said the local air and drinking water continue to show no concerning levels of chemicals in the area. The EPA has 15 air monitoring stations in town and two vans operated by a private company take samples at more locations.

Mark Durno, the EPA’s response coordinator, said it is safe for residents to return home but that he understands some people still have concerns. The EPA and railroad will announce a plan soon to clean homes where residents have complained about odors, he said. The agency will release a separate plan for cleaning Sulphur Run and another creek in town. A majority of waste disposal from the derailment should be completed by the end of September.

Many residents are frustrated by that pace amid ongoing worries about potential health risks. At least two dozen people continue to stay in hotels or rental properties because they say they get sore throats, rashes or bloody noses when they return to homes that haven’t yet been professionally cleaned.

On a recent evening, Durno spoke to about two dozen residents who showed up at a briefing in the basement of the First United Presbyterian Church. Among other things, he said he believes the sheen in the creeks is a “cocktail” mostly made of petroleum products and containing some other chemicals from the derailment.

Jami Wallace, president of a community group called the Unity Council for East Palestine Train Derailment, lamented that the EPA has yet to release its plan to clean the creeks.

“Dr. Tsai is going down there poking this stuff up and still seeing the rainbow,” she said. “It’s been six months. These are our children’s lives.”

Durno said he was frustrated himself and that various state and federal agencies are given the opportunity to review plans, slowing the process. “The whole country is still watching this response—we need to make sure that those plans are right,” he said. “Your frustration is our frustration.”

Ashley McCollum, 33, left her East Palestine home after the derailment and, of late, is staying at the Best Western in Columbiana, Ohio, about 10 miles away, with her 6-year-old son, Zayne, her boyfriend, Matt McAnlis, 35, and two dogs. On a recent day, Zayne played Roblox on one double bed while McAnlis, a steelworker whose shift ended at 7 a.m., was fast asleep on the other. The room’s clock radio was balanced on two cans of Play-Doh near four apples and a box of toys.

A hotel official said seven of the 52 rooms in the hotel were occupied by displaced people from East Palestine. Candy Kiehl, two rooms down from McCollum, said residents meet every evening in the lobby. Both women said Norfolk Southern is paying for their food and hotel bills.

McCollum said she wants to return home, but that after about 5 minutes inside she starts to get a rash, itchy eyes and a tingling sensation in her mouth. Like other residents, she has a phone full of photos from online posts showing necks, arms and torsos with rashes that residents attribute to chemicals from the derailment.

“I feel like I’m a prisoner to the situation,” she said. “You wake up wanting to go home, and you go to bed wanting to go home.”

Last week, Kristina Ferguson, 49, who works at a nearby convenience store and is staying with her family at a house rented by Norfolk Southern, showed a reporter the drain in her basement that she says connects directly to Sulphur Run beneath her house. The chemical smell inside has faded but she said she doubts that her carpets and furniture can be effectively cleaned.

“I don’t think it will ever be safe,” she said. “It got into everything. I know it did.”

In July, Ferguson shared her experience following the Norfolk Southern train derailment during a rally in nearby Lisbon, Ohio.

Nate Velez, 31, said he has been getting nosebleeds every afternoon while working at his engine shop, a few yards from Sulphur Run. He said his business rebuilding motorcycles and lawn mowers is down 70% from last year, a drop he mostly attributes to people staying away from East Palestine and a main road into town that is still closed near the derailment.

“I have to move this shop, I think it’s inevitable,” he said. “I’m surprised I lasted this long.”

The Doctor Won’t See You Now,2023-07-16T20:57:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Andrew Hartz'],"A patient came to a clinic where I worked a few years ago. He was looking for help with depression but also told his therapist that he was feeling frustrated after having lost out on a research fellowship. The patient, who was white, felt the reason was affirmative action. The therapist was Arab. A group of psychiatrists, social workers and psychologists discussed the case at a clinic-wide meeting and came to an apparent consensus: Confront the patient and tell him that if he didn’t overcome his biases, he would be transferred elsewhere. They argued that it would be unfair for a clinician of color to have to provide therapy to a “racist” patient.

The same ideologies that have infiltrated education, medicine and the legal profession have also invaded mental healthcare. The American Psychological Association has decried “traditional masculinity.” The Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association published a paper describing “Whiteness” as a “malignant, parasitic-like condition.” Two years ago, a prominent psychiatrist speaking at Yale shared her fantasies of killing white people. Recently, the president of the APA’s division of psychoanalysis said that therapists should “center Palestine . . . as a central working tenet of any clinical praxis.”

These attitudes are more common than one might imagine. The most recent APA psychoanalysis conference, which has in the past focused on the practice of therapy, was absorbed by identity politics, such as “the white supremacist within” and “psychic colonization,” to quote two panel titles.

Emerging empirical research shows the problem is widespread. One forthcoming study charts a more than 500% increase in politically slanted communiques at the APA from 2000-02 to 2017-19. A 2018 study showed that psychology departments, like most of academia, have extreme bias, with almost 17 registered Democratic professors for every one Republican. The bias is larger at higher ranked schools, and most Republican academics report higher rates of self-censorship.

These ideologies are shaping official standards of practice. The American Counseling Associations’ official competency guidelines frame counselors and clients as either “privileged” or “marginalized.” The National Association for Social Work, which represents many therapists, has a code of ethics requiring “all members of the social work profession to practice through an anti-racist and anti-oppressive lens.”

But the issue isn’t only that clinical practices have become more ideological. Increasing numbers of therapists lack the clinical competency to help patients with truly diverse viewpoints. Years of one-sided education have made many of them unable to tolerate being around people with different views, much less support them as empathic therapists.

The large majority of the country has at least one “unorthodox” opinion—maybe a conservative political bent, a literal belief in the Bible or support for free speech even when it’s offensive. This includes centrists, moderates, libertarians, and many liberals, as well as people who are simply open-minded. These people need mental healthcare as much as anyone else, and they deserve a therapist who respects their values.

Today, people with unorthodox beliefs face unprecedented antagonism, yet the mental health profession largely ignores them. It’s staggering how many populations in need of counseling go overlooked. These include people who have to self-censor, those who’ve faced high costs for their speech, victims of antiwhite bias, cops who face hostility simply for doing their jobs, and couples who might be attached to some traditional features of gender. There are also black people who dislike the dominant racial narrative of the left, gay men and lesbians who feel alienated by aspects of LGBT culture, and women who disagree with aspects of contemporary feminism. Most of these people don’t know where to go to find a therapist who understands their concerns.

To work productively with these groups, therapists need to do more than simply refrain from attacking them or overtly politicizing therapy. Therapists need to have some understanding of patients’ experiences and feel comfortable supporting their goals. Therapists who judge, recoil, or quietly rage at their patients can’t provide effective therapy.

But instead of training therapists to help these people, schools increasingly teach students to view those with unorthodox opinions negatively. The myriad seminars on treating “diverse populations” that students receive in fact only enable them to work with an ideologically narrow segment of the population—albeit a segment of various races and sexual orientations.

Psychological knowledge could even help the country better sustain productive political dialogue. At its best, psychology can help people relate to each other, articulate their concerns, and find solutions to conflict. Unfortunately, as in other professions, the mental health field isn’t adequately cultivating robust debate. This has robbed the country of real insight into the many political issues psychology touches, from the mental health costs of masking and lockdowns to the transgender debates.

To address these concerns, I founded the Open Therapy Institute along with professionals across the political spectrum of many racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds. We have a range of theoretical orientations and areas of expertise, but we all share a commitment to open inquiry and empathic, patient-centered care. We plan to offer interactive online workshops and clinical services in states across the country. We will train professionals to treat overlooked populations.

Millions of Americans are feeling stuck, struggling to respond to a rapidly politicized culture. Most aren’t aware of how transformational psychological concepts can be. If the field becomes an echo chamber, many people won’t get the right care. No psychologist should want that.

Israel Shells Southern Lebanon Amid Fears of Multifront Escalation,2023-07-06T16:17:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Stephen Kalin'],"Israel shelled a village in southern Lebanon on Thursday after explosions were heard in a disputed border area, raising fears of a multifront escalation between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza.

Tensions are high after Israel conducted a deadly two-day military operation in the occupied West Bank earlier this week that killed 12 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier. The incursion into Jenin refugee camp, which involved drone strikes and heavy construction vehicles, marked a more aggressive Israeli approach in the West Bank since an uptick in violence last year. By confiscating weapons and arresting terrorism suspects in the operation, the Israeli military said it aimed to make it easier to operate in Jenin going forward.

Analysts say security forces will now need to be on alert for attacks elsewhere inside of Israel or coming from beyond its borders by Iran-backed militant groups like Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

The chances of escalation are higher than before, but it is hard to predict when that may happen, said Mairav Zonszein, senior analyst for Israel-Palestine at the International Crisis Group.

“The multifront stuff that you’re seeing is bound to continue and Israel is limited in what it can do,” she said. “Israel doesn’t really have an effective strategy for dealing with a lot of these threats.”

Already this week, there has been a car ramming and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv, two shootings in Jewish settlements in the northern West Bank, a salvo of rockets fired from the occupied Gaza Strip and an apparent cross-border strike from southern Lebanon. At least seven civilians were injured.

On Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces said they targeted an area adjacent to the town of Ghajar where they had determined an attack was launched into Israeli territory that United Nations peacekeepers said seemed consistent with a rocket launch. There were no reported casualties.

The border with Lebanon saw an unusual burst of violence in April, when Israel carried out airstrikes against Palestinian militant groups it said had fired off dozens of rockets.

And last weekend, Israel carried out airstrikes near the Syrian city of Homs after an antiaircraft missile exploded over Israeli territory.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is going through one of its deadliest periods in years, coming amid an apparent uptick in Israel’s shadow war with Iran. The Islamic Republic backs militant group Hezbollah, which has a strong presence in southern Lebanon, as well as Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which have historically been active in Gaza but more recently have built out extensive support networks in the West Bank.

Since the start of 2023, more than 150 Palestinians—mostly militants but also children and elderly civilians—have been killed by Israeli forces and civilians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to Palestinian and Israeli officials. More than 20 Israelis and foreigners, nearly all civilians, have been killed by Palestinian attackers, according to a tally by The Wall Street Journal.

The threats come as Israel faces domestic turmoil over the government’s proposals to exert more political control over the judiciary and the continuing expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Scores of military reservists have said they won’t volunteer for duty should the legislation on the judiciary pass, while the settlement activity displaces more Palestinians who are increasingly turning to individual acts of violence outside the framework of organized groups.

Since its 2006 war with Israel, Hezbollah has expanded its arsenal from around 11,000 to 130,000 missiles, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, estimated in 2021.

Biden Follows Jimmy Carter’s Failed Middle East Model,2023-06-28T22:54:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Mike Watson'],"Jerusalem

Little in the Middle East is going America’s way. Iran’s uranium enrichment is approaching weapons grade, Beijing is brokering deals between Tehran and Riyadh, and the Arab League has welcomed Syria’s brutal Bashar al-Assad back into the fold. At a time like this, one would think the U.S. would be working hand in glove with one of its last steady allies in the region: Israel. A recent trip to the Jewish state revealed this isn’t the case.

There’s no shortage of issues primed for cooperation. Jerusalem is concerned about Iran’s nuclear enrichment and well-equipped proxy armies. Those items should also worry Washington, and working on them together could lead to deeper engagement on such issues as the burgeoning Russia-Iran arms trade and China’s regional influence. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly hopes that China’s Middle East maneuvers will force President Biden to tend to the region better.

Yet rather than focus on American interests in the region, the Biden administration has poured its energy into meddling in Israel’s judicial reform and demanding more engagement with the Palestinians. The closest the administration has come to advancing urgent U.S. interests is prodding Israel to export weapons to Ukraine and occasionally raising concerns about Chinese investments in sensitive areas.

The president’s pursuit of backward priorities is fundamentally contradicting his regional goals. Much like President Obama, Mr. Biden seems intent on pacifying Iran. Even after two years of failed talks, he seems to think that an agreement pausing Tehran’s nuclear program will eventually lead to a diplomatic breakthrough that will resolve America’s and its allies’ concerns—or, failing that, give the U.S. enough time to make a graceful exit from the Middle East. Unfortunately for Mr. Biden, the mullahs haven’t rushed to return to the nuclear deal Mr. Obama crafted and Donald Trump exited. The administration is now reportedly working on a more limited “understanding” with Iran.

This leaves Israel with less incentive to follow American priorities, particularly on Ukraine. As things stand, Israel isn’t likely to risk antagonizing the Kremlin by arming Ukraine because Moscow’s bases in Syria grant it an effective veto over Israel’s airstrikes on Iranian assets and proxies in Syria. Russia’s tacit assent will become even more important if Mr. Biden’s “understanding” gives Iran more resources to threaten the Jewish state.

The president’s desire to draw down the U.S. military presence across the Middle East also weakens his hand. As Washington’s ability to exert force in the region declines, so will its influence, particularly over the domestic arrangements of other countries. If China’s presence grows and America’s wanes, Israel will have to respond accordingly. Jerusalem may not court Beijing as assiduously as some of the Gulf states have, but it will become less responsive to Washington’s concerns.

To a certain extent, a mismatch of national priorities is unavoidable in any alliance. By virtue of geography, Iranian aggression is a much more pressing worry for Israel than the U.S. But, as in most relationships, what you get from an alliance depends on what you give. Reducing military presence in the Middle East and maintaining a friendly demeanor toward Tehran both have consequences.

The problem comes when a leader isn’t prepared to stomach them. For Richard Nixon, who wanted America’s allies to handle non-Soviet security challenges without U.S. assistance, losing influence on human rights was an acceptable price for trimming America’s global commitments. Jimmy Carter found this bargain revolting and U.S. military deployments unpalatable, so he harangued America’s friends and foes on human rights and other issues to little effect.

Mr. Biden is in danger of repeating the mistakes of the Carter years, and the Palestinians would be the biggest losers. Having grown disenchanted with Henry Kissinger’s security-focused, incremental approach to Arab-Israeli negotiations, Mr. Carter decided to try for a comprehensive peace with all of Israel’s neighbors. Rather than slog toward a settlement with the Palestinians, Soviets, and Syrians, leaders in Egypt and Israel sidestepped the White House peace effort and instead pursued a bilateral agreement. Egypt got the Sinai, Israel got peace, Mr. Carter got a photo-op for hosting the final round of talks, and the Palestinians got nothing.

Today’s regional dynamics are just as unpromising for the Palestinians, and Mr. Biden’s actions are making things worse for them. The Palestinians have exasperated their fellow Arabs and have few willing international partners; this leaves scant prospects for serious diplomatic intervention. With a final-status solution between Israel and Palestine out of view, the best chance to help Palestinians is to stabilize the Middle East so countries can devote more time to lower-priority issues. Mr. Biden’s Iran policy, however, is making the region more unsettled.

Human-rights advocates often denounce balance-of-power thinking as bloodless and amoral, but their causes fare better when America’s geopolitical situation is stronger. If Mr. Biden is determined to reach an “understanding” with Iran, he should stop delivering sanctimonious lectures to the Israelis.

Supreme Court Gives State Courts More Power Over Corporate Defendants,2023-06-27T15:39:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Jess Bravin'],"The case involved a retired Norfolk Southern employee who alleged he developed cancer from workplace exposure to carcinogens.

WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court rejected a bid by

While the case involved a long-pending workplace lawsuit filed by a retired railway employee from Virginia, Justice Neil Gorsuch , writing for a 5-4 majority of the justices, linked the issue to a Norfolk Southern train’s Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.

“Its cargo? Hazardous chemicals,” Gorsuch wrote, suggesting that under the railroad’s argument, the Constitution could in theory shield the company from some state-court lawsuits while leaving its employees exposed to liability.

At issue was a Pennsylvania law requiring that companies operating within the state consent to lawsuits filed in Pennsylvania courts—even if the allegations involve conduct that took place elsewhere. Norfolk Southern argued that imposing such liability on the railroad, which is based in Georgia and operates in 22 states plus the District of Columbia, violated the Constitution’s due-process clause.

An overheated bearing on a railcar was the likely cause of the Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, federal officials said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called for tougher regulations on the rail industry during a visit to the site. Photo: Alan Freed/Reuters

Not so, Gorsuch wrote, joined in whole or part by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. The court had resolved the matter in a 1917 case, he wrote, when it upheld a lawsuit that an Arizona mining company filed in Missouri against its Pennsylvania-based insurance company for fire damage to a smelter near Cripple Creek, Colo. The insurance company did business in Missouri, which imposed conditions similar to what Pennsylvania does, Gorsuch observed.

States began adopting such laws, Gorsuch wrote, in response to the explosive growth of corporations in the 19th century. States required consent to liability “in exchange for the rights to exploit the local market and to receive the full range of benefits enjoyed by in-state corporations,” he wrote.

Norfolk Southern, Gorsuch said, had complied with the Pennsylvania requirement for decades.

An attorney for Norfolk Southern declined to comment.

The case involved a retired railway employee of Norfolk Southern, Robert Mallory, a Virginia resident who alleged he developed colon cancer from workplace exposure to carcinogens. Mallory said he was exposed to the materials while working in Ohio and Virginia but filed suit in Pennsylvania state court in 2017.

Pennsylvania law authorizes lawsuits against any company registered to do business within the state, but Norfolk Southern, whose freightlines traverse the eastern U.S., argued that constitutional due-process standards should require more than minimal contacts with a state to establish legal jurisdiction over its conduct. Once based in Norfolk, Va., Norfolk Southern moved in 2021 to a new headquarters building in Atlanta.

Norfolk Southern’s safety practices came under new scrutiny after the February derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, released more than 1 million gallons of hazardous chemicals into the environment. The company is facing multiple lawsuits from the incident.

The Mallory case was of interest to businesses nationwide for its potential to limit a practice called forum-shopping, in which litigants try to steer cases into courts they hope will be more sympathetic to their claims.

At oral arguments in November, Mallory’s attorney, Ashley Keller, acknowledged that business groups consider some courts to be “judicial hellholes” for corporate defendants. But “one person’s hellhole is another’s nirvana,” he told the court.

Typically, companies can be sued where an injury occurred or where they are based. Pennsylvania statutes require companies doing business within the state to register and to deem that registration consent to be sued in Pennsylvania courts, regardless of where an alleged injury occurred.

From the case’s outset, Norfolk Southern argued it was unconstitutional to give Pennsylvania state courts blanket jurisdiction over any potential claim against the company. And the Pennsylvania state courts agreed.

It would violate due process to subject an out-of-state company to the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania courts for out-of-state injuries, unless the company’s operations in the state made it “essentially at home in Pennsylvania,” the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said in a 2021 decision.

At November arguments, the lawyer for Norfolk Southern, Carter Phillips, argued that the company never consented to lawsuits in the Pennsylvania courts, even though state law made such consent a condition of doing business there.

“Most rights are not waivable by coercion,” he said then. “You can’t put a gun to the person’s head and say, you know, ‘Give up your Fourth Amendment rights or I blow your head off,’ right?”

Crews Begin Removing Risky Chemical at Montana Train-Derailment Site,2023-06-25T20:18:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Ginger Adams Otis'],"Portions of a freight train are seen in the Yellowstone River after an overnight railroad bridge collapse.

Cleanup crews began the delicate task Sunday of transferring a potentially dangerous substance from the site where a freight train carrying hazardous materials plunged into the Yellowstone River in Montana, according to railroad officials.

Several cars that were part of a Montana Rail Link freight train fell into the river around 6:45 a.m. Saturday when a bridge near Columbus, Mont., collapsed.

Ten cars were affected, according to Montana Rail Link spokesman Andy Garland. Two cars contained sodium hydrosulfide, a flammable substance with a rotten egg odor. The cars carrying that chemical didn’t enter the water, Garland said.

Crews removed the sodium hydrosulfide from the train car Sunday after emergency track repairs were done to facilitate the site cleanup, Garland said. That empty car will be re-railed and moved to a secure location.

The cars that made contact with the Yellowstone River carried molten sulfur and hot asphalt, which harden and solidify upon contact with cooler temperatures, he said. Both materials are flammable in liquid form and can produce potentially dangerous fumes.

The company said it was aware of reports of globs of asphalt appearing down river that might be associated with the derailment.

“We will proactively investigate and sample this material,” Garland said.

Initial assessments suggested there would be no significant downstream movement of the solidified material, according to Garland.

Montana Rail Link has hired a contractor to conduct water-quality sampling with oversight by the state’s Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Preliminary results haven’t shown petroleum hydrocarbons or sulfur impacts to water quality, Garland said. The water-quality testing will continue until clean up is complete.

“At this time there are no known risks to public drinking water,” Garland said.

The derailment occurred in a sparsely populated area of Stillwater County in the Yellowstone River Valley. Yellowstone National Park is about 110 miles south of the area. Railroad crews and first responders rushed to the site from surrounding counties. Officials said neighboring Yellowstone County and the city of Billings, about 40 miles east of Columbus, weren’t expected to suffer environmental impacts from the derailment.

Montana Rail Link said it has operated and maintained that rail line, including the bridge, since 1987 as part of a lease agreement with BNSF Railway.

BNSF Railway, a freight transportation company with a rail network across 28 states and parts of Canada, said it would resume control of the line in 2024.

Federal Railroad Administration investigators at the site are working with local officials on determining the cause of the derailment, an agency spokesman said Sunday. The owner of the bridge is responsible for maintaining and inspecting it, the spokesman said.

“We have requested and will thoroughly review a copy of recent bridge inspection reports for compliance with federal bridge safety standards,” he said. National Transportation Safety Board officials also arrived at the site Sunday.

Sprint contractors are also there to repair a fiber line damaged in the incident.

Public water suppliers in Columbus, Laurel and Billings had stopped drawing from possibly contaminated water as a precautionary measure while waiting for sampling results, according to the DEQ. The facilities have reservoirs to fall back on if necessary, the agency said.

Saturday’s incident was reminiscent of a freight-train derailment in early February that forced the evacuation of about 5,000 residents in East Palestine, Ohio. A

cargo train had hazardous materials in 11 of the cars that came off the tracks.

Emergency responders had to release a chemical from some of the tankers and ignite it to prevent a potentially catastrophic explosion. The toxic spill required an extensive clean up and sparked water-quality concerns among locals who feared contaminants lingered.

Train Cars Fall Into Yellowstone River in Montana After Bridge Collapse,2023-06-24T20:28:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Ginger Adams Otis'],"Montana Rail Link operated the train that had several freight cars fall into the Yellowstone River on Saturday.

Several cars from a freight train fell into the Yellowstone River in Montana on Saturday after a bridge collapsed underneath it, spilling hot asphalt and sulfur into the water.

Residents were warned to avoid the water in the Yellowstone River and connecting waterways. The spilled substances hadn’t spread much beyond the accident site, according to local officials.

The spill occurred in Stillwater County, home to roughly 9,000 residents, at about 6:45 a.m. local time, officials said.

The bridge collapsed as the tail end of the freight train operated by Montana Rail Link moved over it, officials said. No injuries occurred. Eight cars were involved, officials said. Pictures of the scene showed at least three in the water.

Montana Rail Link, a regional railroad based in Missoula, said public safety would be a priority during cleanup.

The molten sulfur and asphalt carried in some of the cars would solidify upon contact with cooler temperatures, the company said.

“We are committed to addressing any potential impacts to the area as a result of this incident and working to understand the reasons behind the accident,” it said.

The Montana Department of Environmental Quality took water samples at several sites, officials said. Air and water monitoring is continuing.

“The state is standing by to support as Montana Rail Link and county officials assess their needs,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said Saturday morning on Twitter.

Montana Fish, Game & Parks closed several of its fishing access points in the region but reopened some of them hours later.

In early February, a Norfolk Southern cargo train derailed near the Ohio town of East Palestine close to the Pennsylvania border. Eleven of the derailed cars carried hazardous materials. Emergency responders had to release a chemical from some of the tankers and ignite it to prevent a potentially catastrophic explosion.

Residents within a one-mile radius of East Palestine, an Ohio village of nearly 5,000 people, were evacuated after the toxic spill. It sparked water-quality concerns among locals who feared contaminants lingered.

NTSB Returns to East Palestine for Hearings on Toxic Train Derailment,2023-06-22T13:03:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Esther Fung'],"EAST PALESTINE, OHIO—A

The new details were provided by the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Feb. 3. derailment that released toxic chemicals in this small Ohio town.

A Norfolk engineer in Decatur, Il., expressed concerns about the size of the roughly 140-car train the day before the accident, according to the NTSB report. While the train was in compliance with Norfolk rules, the engineer said the train was carrying more weight at the rear than at the front, “so, to me, that’s why we reported that to the yardmaster.”

The report found the train was stopped twice for mechanical issues: to repair an air- pressure issue near Bement, Ill., and a broken knuckle near Williamsport, Ind. The accident was later caused by a different mechanical issue, a wheel bearing that overheated, the NTSB has said.

A Norfolk spokesman said that the train met the company’s policies for configurations at the time of the derailment, and that it is evaluating ways to improve its train-building standards. The company has said it would cooperate with the investigation, review its operations and pay to clean up East Palestine.

Four months after the derailment released toxic chemicals in this town, some residents say they are distrustful of the responses by government agencies and the railroad, and still worried about possible long-term health effects.

On Wednesday evening, around 70 people attended a community meeting at East Palestine High School organized by federal transportation safety investigators, who on Thursday kicked off a two-day investigative hearing.

The auditorium was about half full and several residents said they were skeptical the NTSB’s hearing would result in safer rail transportation.

“Are they really just an exercise in futility? Because regulations that were in place obviously weren’t enough to stop” the accident in East Palestine, said resident Bennett Bruno, adding that he wonders if future regulations would be controlled by lobbyists rather than the NTSB.

“The NTSB’s goal is to prevent the tragedy from reoccurring and we issue safety recommendations that we believe will do that. And then we fight, vigorously, to get those implemented,” said Jennifer Homendy, chair of the NTSB, in response to the question.

At Thursday’s hearing, the NTSB said that about 12 minutes after the accident Norfolk emailed data on the train’s contents to a contractor that would cleanup the site, but it took nearly an hour for the railroad to relay the same information to firefighters in East Palestine.

A Norfolk spokesman later said that NTSB officials didn’t take into account a time zone change and the email was actually sent about an hour later than stated during the hearing —a fact the NTSB later confirmed.

Officials from Norfolk and OxyVinyls, the chemical company shipping vinyl chloride on the train, were at odds at the hearing about whether there was polymerization (a chemical process that is thought to raise the risk of an explosion) occurring in the tank cars. Responders have said they released the chemicals and did a controlled burn—creating a black plume of smoke—to avoid a potential explosion.

A Norfolk representative at the hearing said heat damage to the pressurized tank cars was also a factor in the decision to vent and burn the chemicals.

Norfolk Southern has said it would add more trackside sensors and review its safety operations. In East Palestine, it has pledged to provide funds for long-term medical costs and to reimburse home sellers near the site who sell their homes for less than the property’s appraised value before the February derailment. It has signaled that the price tag for the cleanup and related costs could approach $400 million.

How Republicans and Big Business Broke Up,2023-06-14T14:04:00Z,Wall Street Journal,['Brody Mullins'],"WASHINGTON—Once considered natural political allies, the Republican Party and big business are drifting apart. One sign of their estrangement: GOP lawmakers are weaning themselves off money from corporate political-action committees.

Republicans are now less dependent on corporate and industry PACs than at any time in the past three decades, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis based on data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Instead, they are turning to smaller donations from millions of individuals who tend to be wary of big-businesses priorities such as free trade.

Conservatives say the fault for the breakup lies with CEOs who increasingly meddle in politics by taking progressive stances on divisive social issues. Executives who had hoped such rancor would fade when Donald Trump left office are now facing a hostile GOP in Congress.

Republicans have emerged as the unlikely champions of reining in industries from Big Tech to Wall Street. Some are taking up causes once associated with old-school Democrats, advancing bills that give more power to the federal government to raise wages for blue-collar workers and lower drug costs for consumers.

“Gone are the days that Republicans are going to sit on the sidelines as big behemoths take advantage of the American people,” said Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee in a written statement to the Journal. “We are going to hold them accountable,” she added.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has lived through the cycle. In the 2016 election that swept Trump to the White House, pro-business groups saw an ally in the Republican from California’s conservative-leaning agricultural heartland.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think will be the connection between big business and the Republican party moving forward? Join the conversation below.

More than 40% of the money given to his re-election campaign that year came from business PACs. As House majority leader, he pushed for business-friendly legislation that included reduced regulations on big banks, a historic tax cut for corporations and a sweeping free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada.

By 2022, when a Republican tide elevated McCarthy to speaker, the corporate-money pipeline was dwindling, accounting for less than 3% of his campaign funds. And McCarthy’s friendship with big business was fraying.

These days, McCarthy is using his position to castigate Wall Street for taking progressive political stands. He opposed industry-endorsed measures to expand federal spending on infrastructure, liberalize immigration rules and a bill to provide $53 billion in financial assistance and incentives for the U.S. semiconductor industry.

The Republican Party’s “shifting sentiment away from corporate America is a result of their increasing activism that alienates Republicans and their constituents,” said Matt Sparks, an adviser to McCarthy and his former deputy chief of staff.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the number of Republicans in the House who received at least 40% of their campaign war chests from industry and corporate PACs, which raise money through voluntary contributions from executives and managers.

In the 2022 election, fewer House Republicans relied on corporate PACs to fund their campaigns than in any other election in the past 30 years. In 2016, a majority of House Republicans — 128 in all — received more than 40% of their campaign funds from corporate PACs, the Journal found. But in the most recent election, just 42 House Republicans, or 17% of the total, were dependent on corporate PAC money. Republicans received $189 million from corporate PACs in 2022, down from $260 million in the 2016 election, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Democrats increased their share from corporate PACs to $155 million, up from $135 million in 2016.

It is still far from clear whether the break with big business is permanent. Most Republican members of Congress say they continue to embrace free-enterprise policies that have prevailed in the party for decades, such as reducing government regulation on industry, lowering taxes and limiting the clout of labor unions.

There are signs that some CEOs are reconsidering the wisdom of weighing in on sensitive political or social matters. Several financial-services CEOs have met with McCarthy to tell him that they are doing their best to avoid speaking publicly about such topics, according to people familiar with the meetings.

Republican lawmakers “appreciate when these guys come in and acknowledge the elephant and say, ‘I am the leader of a big institution with lots of perspectives and I am doing my best as a CEO to avoid talking about some of these issues and focus on running my company,’ ” said John Stipicevic, a former longtime aide to the speaker who is now a corporate lobbyist.

Recent Republican legislative initiatives include measures to break up the meatpacking industry, tighten safety regulations for railroads and allow the federal government to claw back bonuses from executives whose banks fail. They’re also turning to the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and other federal agencies to curb industries that they believe are harming Americans.

“At least on certain issues like tech, we’re going to have to accept the fact that the DOJ, the FTC have a role to play here,” said Sen. J.D. Vance (R., Ohio), one of a new group of populist Republicans recently elected to the Senate. “I think the only enemy that can rein in tech companies is the federal government.”

The bad blood extends well beyond Washington. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Walt Disney are locked in a high-stakes legal battle over corporate power, governmental control and freedom of speech.

In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and the GOP-run state house banned the state from doing business with BlackRock,

and several other banks after accusing them of boycotting investments in the oil industry in favor of renewable-fuel companies. In January, Texas bannedfrom the state’s municipal-bond business after the state attorney general said the bank discriminates against gun manufacturers.

A spokesman for Citigroup said the bank doesn’t discriminate against gun manufacturers and “simply uses industry best practices in terms of firearms sales.”

A BlackRock spokesman said the company supports investments in both fossil fuels and renewable energy. A spokesman for JPMorgan referred to comments CEO Jamie Dimon made during the company’s annual shareholder meeting in May, in which he called himself “a red-blooded, patriotic, free-enterprise and free-market capitalist (properly regulated, of course).”

The proposed $20 billion merger between grocery giants Albertsons and Kroger has come under fire from Republicans not only on antitrust grounds but also over issues of corporate culture.

At a Senate hearing on the merger in November, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) questioned

CEO Rodney McMullen about why the company had fired two employees who refused to wear an apron with a gay-pride insignia.

The senator cited the firings as an example of a corporation imposing progressive social positions on employees—and said Republicans were growing weary of reflexively defending the biggest U.S. companies.

“They probably shouldn’t come and ask Republican senators to carry the water for them,” he said, “whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers.”

In response to the senator, McMullen said “we think it’s incredibly important to be an inclusive, open culture to welcome all associates.”

Some academics say that big corporations are increasingly taking progressive stances on issues such as gay rights, gun control and climate-change policy, often to cater to liberal workforces.

“Most large corporations are located in cities and companies are looking for young, educated workers, who increasingly have left-wing values—both of which push companies to be more progressive,” said Romain Wacziarg, a professor of economics at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.

Those stances have sparked cultural friction with many in the Republican Party, who increasingly represent less educated, blue-collar workers in rural areas who often tend to hold more conservative views on those issues. The result is a widening divide between U.S. companies and many Republicans.

Vance, the freshman GOP senator, said some Republican lawmakers are replacing their deep-seated distrust of the federal government with a realization that only the government is powerful enough to rein in such large corporations.

“This is not just a sort of mild shift,” said Vance. “There is something structural here.”

Sen. Steve Daines (R., Mont.) first ran for Senate in 2014 on a pro-business platform, with corporate PACs bankrolling about 25% of his $7.5 million war chest.

By the time Daines ran for re-election in 2020, Mr. Daines raised more than $30 million for his campaign, but just about 10% came from corporate PACs.

Much of Daines’s campaign funds came from small-dollar donors, who contribute $10, $25 or $50 each. In his second term, Daines changed some of his positions on business priorities, voting against reauthorizing the U.S. Export-Import Bank, bucking a lobbying push by

and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

In June of 2021, he joined seven Senate Republicans to require union-scale wages on certain public-works projects, a rare move for a member of the Republican Party.

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was one of the Republicans who backed higher wages as part of a broader bill to give billions of dollars in federal money and incentives to encourage semiconductor companies to build new plants in the United States.

“As we invest tens of billions of dollars into critical industries,” he said at the time, “it is only right that we require that those funds also invest in the men and women who will build and maintain these cutting-edge facilities.”

Rubio was once a traditional conservative who espoused Ronald Reagan’s pro-business agenda.

Rubio has since reversed course on some issues. He publicly endorsed permitting employees of

to form a labor union and has questioned free-trade agreements, especially with China. He calls his economic policy “common-good capitalism,” aimed at raising wages for blue-collar workers.

Many of the economic policies championed by Republicans early in his career didn’t help American workers and “led to a sustained period of decadence,” he writes in his book, “Decades of Decadence,” which went on sale this week.

After the

train crash in East Palestine, Ohio, several Republicans blamed the company and its executives and jumped on legislation to create new safety measures for the U.S. railroad industry designed to protect consumers.

Among those supporting the bill are Rubio, Vance and Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah).

“If you go to East Palestine, and you talk to people, yeah, they’re very skeptical of the EPA,” Vance said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. “But they really hate Norfolk Southern.”

Norfolk Southern declined to comment. The company’s CEO said earlier this year that he was sorry about the accident and that safety measures weren’t enough to prevent it.

Many industry chiefs initially cheered the results of the November elections because the win by Republicans ousted Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and replaced Democratic committee chairs with a group of Republicans they thought would be aligned with the interests of industry.

Instead, newly empowered Republican committee chairs launched investigations into Wall Street firms, Big Tech companies and others for actions such as promoting gay-friendly policies, limiting loans to fossil-fuel companies and doing business in China.

Rep. James Comer (R., Ky.), the new chair of the House Oversight Committee, demanded answers from

, Express Scripts and others about their role in the cost of drugs. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) issued subpoenas to executives at several Big Tech firms seeking documents related to what he considers their collusion with the federal government to suppress speech on their platforms. The tech industry has denied wrongdoing.

In the Senate, every Republican incumbent who ran in both 2016 and 2022 received a smaller share of their money from corporate PACs in the most recent election than the prior one, the Journal found.

“I don’t see any reason to take a dime from those folks,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican senator who has endorsed several populist bills. “I’m not going to be beholden in any way to their agenda. At the multinational level, more and more of these corporations, their agenda really diverges from the interests of American workers and the American middle class.”

‘My Hijacking’ Review: Shielded by Trauma,2023-06-12T22:20:00Z,Wall Street Journal,"['Diane Cole', 'Martha Hodes']","In 1977, an armed group of Hanafi Muslims took over the B’nai B’rith building in Washington, D.C., where I worked, holding more than 100 of us hostage for 39 hours. Although I was not physically harmed in the ordeal, I still cannot erase from memory the visceral terror and stark vulnerability our captors unleashed on us as they brandished their weapons and threatened to kill us.

By contrast, in “My Hijacking: A Personal History of Forgetting and Remembering,” the New York University professor and historian Martha Hodes describes how for decades a memory block had obstructed her ability to recall all but momentary flashes of the harrowing experience her 12-year-old self endured in 1970. “Why did I remember so little,” she asks, “and what could remembering tell me?”

This memoir is her answer. Her propulsive, high-stress journey is filled with dread and fear, underpinned by her hard-won compassion for the profound pain her long-ago self believed she had no choice but to disown.

Ms. Hodes opens with a summary of the hijacking she had willed herself to forget. On Sept. 6, 1970, she and her 13-year-old sister, Catherine, boarded a New York-bound TWA jet in Tel Aviv. That morning they had said goodbye to their mother, with whom they had just spent the summer at the home she shared with her second husband and their newborn; upon landing in New York, they would be met by their father, with whom they lived the rest of the year. On the last leg of the flight, after stops in Athens and Frankfurt, two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) stormed the cockpit and diverted the plane to a remote airfield in the Jordanian desert. It was one of the most brazen episodes of air piracy prior to 9/11.

In fact, it took the raw destruction of Sept. 11, 2001, to begin to jar loose Ms. Hodes’s memories. While teaching a class in downtown Manhattan, she heard the blasts of the planes crashing into the Twin Towers and later saw the smoking ruins. Soon, unnerving fears and intrusive memories began popping up, as if her unconscious mind was making connections that her rational self still struggled to ward off. But the message came through. “For the first time ever, I wanted to know more,” she writes. “I wanted to connect the twelve-year-old girl who buried as much as she could to the grown-up struggling to understand what happened to that girl. . . . As a hostage I had quelled memories and emotions; as a historian I wanted to search for facts and feelings, to provide meaning for everything that had happened to me and my family.”

It takes every tool in her professional toolbox for Ms. Hodes to breach the divide. She doggedly sifts through official documents, media accounts, government and corporate archives, and various other sources. She tracks down other former hostages, whose eyewitness testimony, she hopes, will permit her to vicariously live through scenes of which she herself had no recollection. Her most valuable source would seem to be the diary she kept during the summer and fall of 1970, which she had packed away for decades. Yet her written record turns out to be almost as spotty and elusive as her memory.

Ms. Hodes turns to her research to fill in the gaps. Soon after their plane landed in the desert, she learns, the hijackers welcomed aboard additional commandos, who had been hiding on the ground awaiting the jet’s arrival. Within hours, a Swissair jet, also hijacked by the PFLP, alighted and parked close by, bringing the total number of hostages to more than 300. Three days later, a third PFLP-commandeered plane pulled in, delivering still more hostages.

News quickly spread among the captives about a fourth hijacked jet that the PFLP had diverted to, and blown up, in Cairo; that an attempted fifth hijacking had been successfully averted and that the crew had killed one of the PFLP terrorists and delivered the other, Leila Khaled, to British authorities after an emergency landing in London. Khaled’s freedom was one of the PFLP’s bargaining chips in negotiations to release young Martha and the other hostages in the desert.

It took a full week to broker the deal. In the meantime, the commandos busied themselves planting explosives throughout the planes. They interrogated the passengers about their religions and nationalities and lectured them about the PFLP’s cause. They released select groups of hostages without explaining why and whether the vans into which they were herded would take them to freedom or another place of captivity.

Martha and Catherine were among the hostages who remained, enduring ever worsening conditions. Food supplies began to rot and run out, scant drinkable water had to be carefully rationed, toilets were clogged to overflowing and everyone stank of sweat. This is “the part of the ordeal I’d most thoroughly forgotten, the part I couldn’t recall no matter how hard I concentrated,” Ms. Hodes writes. “It was what I barely recorded in my diary, what I didn’t much want to talk about, and what I succeeded in blocking out very soon afterward.”

Nor did her mother or father want to talk or hear much about their extended trauma after Martha and Catherine were finally released—a fact that becomes all too clear as Ms. Hodes listens to a long-forgotten interview with herself, her sister and their father that was recorded soon after the sisters’ return. Only then does Ms. Hodes begin to comprehend that her detachment from her 12-year-old self had not begun with the hijacking.

This was the psychological mystery that had been hiding in plain sight. Martha’s need to escape her personal heartache had started with the divorce that split her family across continents. Her anguish had been compounded by the unspoken family agreement to never admit the grief and vulnerability those rearrangements had cost. She could not voice her pain, not even in her diary. From that perspective, the hijacking was not only an abhorrent horror, it was also the collateral damage of divorce. Why else would the two young sisters have been flying, unaccompanied by an adult, on that ill-fated flight?

Given so much trauma, 12-year-old Martha chose denial over remembering. But as she discovers as an adult, such strategies only work until they don’t. In reclaiming her personal history, Ms. Hodes has provided a lesson for us all in the power of memory both to conceal and heal.

Ms. Cole is the author of the memoir “After Great Pain: A New Life Emerges.”"
